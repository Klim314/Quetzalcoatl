TI  == discrepancy in maldi-tof ms identification of uncommon gram-negative bacteria from lower respiratory secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == introduction: early identification of microbial organisms from respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) is important to guide therapeutic decisions. the objective was to compare the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) relative to the conventional phenotypic method in identifying common bacterial isolates, including nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria, in a cohort of patients with cf. methods: a total of 123 isolates from 50 patients with cf representing 14 bacterial species from respiratory specimens were identified using maldi-tof ms in parallel with conventional phenotypic methods. discrepancies were confirmed by 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing in five  gram-negative isolates. results: the maldi-tof ms managed to identify 122/123 (99.2%) bacterial isolates to the genus level and 118/123 (95.9%) were identified to the species level. the maldi-tof ms results were 100% consistent to the species level with conventional phenotypic identification for isolates of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, achromobacter xylosoxidans, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other uncommon organisms such as chryseobacterium gleum and enterobacter cloacae. the 5/123 (4.6%) isolates misidentified were all gram-negative bacteria. the isolation of e. cloacae and haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus may extend the potentially pathogenic list of organisms isolated from patients with cf. conclusion: although the technique provides an early identification and antimicrobial therapy approach in patients with cf, limitation in the diagnosis of uncommon gram-negative bacteria may exist.

TI  == the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), a simple and low-cost alternative for the carba np test to assess phenotypic carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods.
AB  == a new phenotypic test, called the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), was developed to detect carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods within eight hours. this method showed high concordance with results obtained by pcr to detect genes coding for the carbapenemases kpc, ndm, oxa-48, vim, imp and oxa-23. it allows reliable detection of carbapenemase activity encoded by various genes in species of enterobacteriaceae (e.g., klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and  enterobacter cloacae), but also in non-fermenters pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the cim was shown to be a cost-effective and highly robust phenotypic screening method that can reliably detect carbapenemase activity.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == bacteriological investigation of chronic wounds in a specialized wound healing department: a retrospective analysis of 107 cases.
AB  == to investigate the information of chronic wounds, especially in the aspect of microbiological profile and to explore the relationship between the wound culture result and chronic wounds infection, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 107 patients with chronic wounds from january 2011 to december 2013. the sociodemographic data, wound-related information, therapeutic type, and wound infection status were extracted. microbial specimens were obtained and processed  using standard hospital procedure for wound culture. the predominant pathogen isolated was staphylococcus aureus (n = 11, 26.2%), followed by escherichia coli  (n = 6, 14.3%), enterobacter cloacae (n = 3, 7.1%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3, 7.1%). sixty percent of the infectious chronic wounds had positive culture,  and 96.2% of the noninfectious wounds had negative culture. in conclusion, the microbial characteristics were mostly in the site of lower extremity, gram-negative bacteria, and monopathogen, respectively. furthermore, the relationship between the wound culture result and chronic wound infection was not exactly coincident. it may be useful for guiding the empiric therapy of chronic wounds.

TI  == pancreatic fistulae secondary to trypsinogen activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa infection after pancreatoduodenectomy.
AB  == background: pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy (pd) is associated with high mortality and morbidity. trypsinogen activation and bacteria, although  hypothesized to be interrelated etiopathogenetically, have not had their relationship and pathogenic mechanisms elucidated. this study investigated bacterial involvement in pancreatic juice activation perioperatively after pd at  sites of pancreatic fistula formation. methods: fifty patients underwent pd; postoperative pancreatic fistulae were graded based on the international study group for pancreatic fistula grading criteria. bacteria were isolated from cultures of drainage fluid. digested peptides from trypsinogen and bacterial culture supernatants underwent sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) separation and mass spectrometric analysis. zymography was used to detect the trypsinogen activator. results: pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae isolated from drainage fluid in patients with grades b and c pancreatic fistulae could cause trypsinogen activation. trypsinogen activation by p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae were preventable by the use of a serine protease inhibitor in vitro. a protease in the supernatant from p. aeruginosa-positive cultures acted as the trypsinogen activator. conclusions: infection with p. aeruginosa perioperatively to pd entails secretion of a protease activator of trypsinogen to trypsin. bacterial infection control in the perioperative pd period could be crucial to prevent development of pancreatic fistula.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == acquisition of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli in intensive care unit: predictors and molecular epidemiology.
AB  == objectives: we had for aim to determine the risk factors for acquiring carbapenem-intermediate or -resistant gram-negative bacilli (cr-gnb) in an intensive care unit (icu) and to identify the resistance mechanisms involved. patients and methods: we conducted an observational prospective cohort study during 6 months in medical and surgical icus of the besancon teaching hospital. patients with acquired cr-gnb were patients whose cultures (screening or diagnosis) became positive more than 48h after admission to the icu. the risk factors for icu-acquired cr-gnb were determined by multivariate logistic regression. cr-gnb isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and screened for resistance mechanisms with phenotypic and genotypic tests. results: twenty-three of the 347 included patients had acquired a cr-gnb. the multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between this acquisition  and the duration of previous treatments with piperacillin-tazobactam (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 1.13, p=0.02) and aminoglycosides (aor, 1.62; p=0.005), but not with carbapenems. the cr-gnb strains were identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=7), and enterobacter cloacae (n=6). no acquired carbapenemase-producing strain was identified. pfge typing identified 1  multiple clone among p. aeruginosa isolates (4 patients), whereas for the other bacteria, all the strains were different. conclusion: our study results suggest that the strategy to prevent the emergence and spread of cr-gnb should not be limited to the sole restriction of carbapenem use in icu settings.

TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime-avibactam combination in in vitro checkerboard assays.
AB  == to evaluate the in vitro effects of the combination of ceftazidime and avibactam  on the mics of both compounds, checkerboard assays were performed for 81 clinical strains, including 55 enterobacteriaceae strains (32 klebsiella pneumoniae, 19 escherichia coli, 1 citrobacter freundii, and 3 enterobacter cloacae) and 26 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, all with known resistance mechanisms such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and carbapenemases, phenotypically or molecularly determined. phenotypically ceftazidime-resistant strains (n=69) were  analyzed in more detail. for the enterobacteriaceae strains, a concentration-dependent effect of avibactam was found for most strains with a maximum effect of avibactam at a concentration of 4 mg/liter, which decreased all ceftazidime mics to </=4 mg/liter. avibactam alone also showed antibacterial activity (the mic50 and mic90 being 8 and 16 mg/liter, respectively). for the ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa strains, considerable inhibition of beta-lactamases by avibactam was acquired at a concentration of 4 mg/liter, which decreased all ceftazidime mics except one to </=8 mg/liter (the clsi and eucast susceptible breakpoint). increasing the concentration of avibactam further decreased the mics, resulting in a maximum effect for most strains at 8 to 16 mg/liter. in summary, for most strains, the tested addition of avibactam of 4 mg/liter restored the antibacterial activity of ceftazidime to a level comparable to that of wild-type strains, indicating full inhibition, and strains became susceptible according to the eucast and clsi criteria. based on these in vitro data, avibactam is a promising inhibitor of different beta-lactamases, including  esbls and carbapenemases.

AB  == background: increasing multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacilli (gnb) infections poses a serious threat to public health. few studies have analyzed co-resistance rates, defined as an antimicrobial susceptibility profile in a subset already resistant to one specific antibiotic. the epidemiologic and clinical utility of determining co-resistance rates are analyzed and discussed. methods: a 10-year retrospective study from 2002-2011 of bloodstream infections with gnb were analyzed from three hospitals in greater vancouver, bc, canada. descriptive statistics were calculated for antimicrobial resistance and co-resistance. statistical analysis further described temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance, correlations of resistance between combinations of antimicrobials, and temporal trends in co-resistance patterns. results: the total number of unique blood stream isolates of gnb was 3280. increasing resistance to  individual antimicrobials was observed for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. cloacae, and p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli peaked in 2006 at 40% and subsequently stabilized at 29% in 2011, corresponding to decreasing ciprofloxacin usage after 2007, as assessed by defined daily dose utilization data. high co-resistance rates were observed for ceftriaxone-resistant e. coli with ciprofloxacin (73%), ceftriaxone-resistant k. pneumoniae with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83%), ciprofloxacin-resistant e. cloacae with ticarcillin-clavulanate (91%), and piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant p. aeruginosa with ceftazidime (83%). conclusions: increasing antimicrobial resistance was demonstrated over the study period, which may partially be associated with antimicrobial consumption. the study of co-resistance rates in multidrug resistant gnb provides insight into the epidemiology of resistance acquisition, and may be used as a clinical tool to aid prescribing empiric antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == supporting the ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam enterobacteriaceae breakpoint determination using humanised in vivo exposures in a thigh model.
AB  == previous in vivo studies using a human-simulated regimen of ceftaroline/avibactam 600/600mg every 8h (q8h) showed activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, ampc- and kpc-producing enterobacteriaceae with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) </= 1 mug/ml. here we sought to determine the efficacy of this human-simulated regimen against organisms with mics >/= 1 mug/ml to help determine a breakpoint value that would reliability predict efficacy in humans. in total, 31 isolates (1 escherichia coli, 9 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 enterobacter cloacae, 1 citrobacter koseri, 2 serratia marcescens, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa) with ceftaroline/avibactam mics of 1 to 16  mug/ml were tested in a murine immunocompromised thigh infection model; 15 isolates were also tested in an immunocompetent model. doses were given to simulate human free drug exposures of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h over 24h as a 1-h infusion by targeting the ft>mic profile. efficacy was evaluated as the change in log10 cfu compared with 0-h controls after 24h. reductions in bacterial cfu in the neutropenic model were seen against a majority of isolates tested with mics </= 4 mug/ml, where ft>mic was >55%. more variable efficacy was seen in isolates with mics >/= 8 mug/ml, where ft>mic drops below 40%. overall activity was enhanced in the immunocompetent model. the humanised regimen of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h as a 1-h infusion showed  predictable efficacy against isolates with various genotypic and phenotypic profiles and mics </= 4 mug/ml. these data provide valuable information to help determine a ceftaroline/avibactam breakpoint for enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == trends in bacterial wound isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility in a pediatric burn hospital.
AB  == the purpose of this retrospective study was to collate data dealing with organisms cultured from the burn patients and evaluate trends in antimicrobial susceptibility. all cultures collected from each acute admission patient between  2004 and 2011 in the 30-bed pediatric burn hospital were evaluated for their annual frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility. duplicate cultures were excluded. staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (25% of total isolates; range, 69-408 isolates/yr), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%; range, 40-202 isolates/yr), coagulase-negative staphylococci (9%; range, 2-188 isolates/yr), enterobacter cloacae (8%; range, 22-128 isolates/yr), and escherichia coli (6%; range, 19-91 isolates/yr). this rank order remained relatively consistent during the period of study. the emergence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased from 20% in 2004 to about 45% in 2009 to 2011. susceptibility to vancomycin was still 100%. in comparing periods 2004 to 2007 and 2008 to 2011, p. aeruginosa showed increased susceptibility to cefepime (from 76% to 84%) and the aminoglycosides (from 68% to 81%), whereas susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam remained high (from 91% to 93%). e. cloacae demonstrated 90 to 100% susceptibility to aminoglycosides, cefepime, and  imipenem. e. coli showed an increased rate of resistance to ceftazidime but was still susceptible to imipenem and amikacin. s. aureus and p. aeruginosa continue  to be the most prevalent organisms cultured from our pediatric burn population. almost half of the staphylococcal isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus.  despite widespread use of piperacillin-tazobactam, p. aeruginosa susceptibility remained high. several classes of antimicrobials continued to demonstrate good to excellent activity against the majority of organisms cultured from the burn patients.

TI  == highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an iraqi burn care unit.
AB  == objective: in low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. we describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in iraq. methods: we performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between july 2008 and september 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in iraq who developed sepsis. results: in 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% ci 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. the most commonly isolated organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). a high proportion of enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and s. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. for gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. conclusions: burn patients with sepsis in iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class  antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.

TI  == french regional surveillance program of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli: results from a 2-year period.
AB  == in february 2011, the carb-lr group was created as a sentinel laboratory-based surveillance network to control the emergence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (cr gnb) in a french southern region. we report the epidemiological results of a 2-year study. all the gram-negative bacilli isolates detected in the different labs (hospital and community settings) of a french southern region and with reduced susceptibility to ertapenem and/or imipenem were characterised with regard to antibiotic resistance, bla genes content, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) profiles and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). a total of 221 strains were analysed. acinetobacter baumannii was the most prevalent carbapenemase-producing bacteria, with a majority of oxa-23 producers (n = 37). one isolate co-produced oxa-23 and oxa-58  enzymes. klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) (oxa-48 producer: n = 29, kpc producer: n = 1), followed by escherichia coli (oxa-48 producer: n = 8, kpc producer: n = 1) and enterobacter cloacae (oxa-48 producer, n = 1). one isolate of pseudomonas aeruginosa produced a vim-1 carbapenemase. a clonal diversity of carbapenemase-producing k. pneumoniae and e. coli was noted with different mlsts. on the other hand, almost all oxa-23-producing a. baumannii strains belonged to the widespread st2/international clone ii. the link between the detection of cr gnb and a foreign country was less obvious, suggesting the beginning of a local cross-transmission. the number of cr gnb cases in our french southern region has  sharply increased very recently due to the diffusion of oxa-48 producers.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in vietnam: report from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart 2009-2011).
AB  == treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from  vietnam. this study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in vietnam during 2009-2011. a total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends. antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. among the species collected, escherichia coli (48.1% esbl-positive) and klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% esbl-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. ertapenem mic90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/ml and remained unchanged for esbl-positive isolates. imipenem mic90 values were also the same for all isolates and esbl-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/ml, respectively. ertapenem mic90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/ml, respectively. analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that ctx-m variants, particularly ctx-m-27 and ctx-m-15, were the predominant enzymes. high resistance rates in vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout asia and globally.

TI  == microbiology, risk factors and mortality of patients with intravenous catheter related blood stream infections in the surgical intensive care unit: a five-year, concurrent, case-controlled study.
AB  == objective: the epidemiologic data of catheter related blood stream infections (crbsi) is different in each type of intensive care unit (icu). the objectives were to identify microbiological patterns, risk factors and mortality analysis in the surgical intensive care unit (sicu). material and method: all crbsi cases were reviewed in a 60-months period from the 1st ofjanuary, 2005 through the 31st of december, 2009. two or three control patients, who had been catheterized within three days and were free of crbsi, were randomly selected from the icu admissions registration book as the control group; demographic data, mortality, organisms found and antibiotic sensitivity were recorded and analyzed. results: in the 5-years period, 44 patients were diagnosed with a crbsi and 129 patients who were without a crbsi were selected. the total infection rate was 1.31 per 1,000 catheter-days. nine patients who contracted a crbsi (20.4%) expired. a primary diagnosis of gastrointestinal problems had shown the greatest risk for developing a crbsi (69.7%). in proportions of gram negative bacteria:gram positive bacteria:fungus, this was measured at 43:36:21 respectively. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram positive bacteria found. klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the three most common gram negative bacteria found. the chance of developing a crbsi  was significantly increased after 10 days of catheterization. the mortality probability of gram negative bacterial infections and fungal infections increased over time. this was in contrast to gram positive bacterial infections, which decreased over time despite having shown the highest possibility of death earlier in catheter days. as for multivariable analyses, catheterization of patients in the general wards was the sole independent risk factor of crbsi occurrences (or = 8.67, p < 0.01) and the males (or = 7.20, p = 0.03) have shown the highest risk factors for mortality. conclusion: the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria related crbsi was similar but the probability patterns of  increasing the catheter days relating to crbsi occurrence and mortality rates were different. catheterization in the general wards was the only independent risk factor found for contracting a crbsi in our institute. males had the highest risk for mortality.

TI  == eliciting antibiotics active against the eskape pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils.
AB  == the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. in recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the himalaya and qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against mdr pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes  were identified - predominantly streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the mdr clinical isolates referred to as eskape pathogens: enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or enterobacter cloacae. antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not  described previously. our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that  have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific  pathogen.

TI  == pathogen characteristics reveal novel antibacterial approaches for interstitial lung disease.
AB  == interstitial lung disease (ild) is a clinical disorder associated with changes of lung structure. concurrent infection is a serious complication and one of the major factors that exacerbates ild. pathogen screening is a critical step in early diagnosis and proper treatment of ild with secondary infection. here we analyzed distribution and drug susceptibility of pathogens isolated from hospitalized ild patients from january, 2007 to december, 2008 and compared them  to bacterial drug resistance data in chinet during the same period. the main specimens were from sputum culture, lavage fluid culture, lung biopsy tissue culture, and pleural effusion culture and bacterial or fungal cultures were performed on these specimens accordingly. drug susceptibility was tested for positive bacterial cultures using disk diffusion (kirby-bauer method) and e test  strips in which results were determined based on the criteria of clsi (2007). a total of 371 pathogen strains from ild patients, including 306 bacterial strains  and 65 fungal strains were isolated and cultured. five main bacterial strains and their distribution were as follows: klebsiella pneumoniae (31.7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.6%), acinetobacter (12.7%), enterobacter cloacae (8.2%), and staphylococcus aureus (7.8%). the results showed that ild patients who had anti-infection treatment tended to have gram-negative bacteria, whether they acquired an infection in the hospital or elsewhere. drug resistance screening indicated that aminoglycosides and carbapenems had lower antibiotic resistance rates. in addition, we found that the usage of immunosuppressants was associated  with the increased infection rate and number of pathogens that were isolated. in  conclusion, aminoglycosides and carbapenems may be selected as a priority for secondary infection to control ild progression. meanwhile, the use of anti-mrsa/mrcns drugs may be considered for staphylococcus infection.

TI  == the use of colistin in critically ill children in a pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  == background: colistin is active against most multidrug-resistant, aerobic gram-negative bacteria. because of the reported nephrotoxicity during the first years of use of colistin, there were concerns of its use in pediatrics where there was limited experience the aim of this study is to document the clinical characteristics and outcomes of use of colistin in pediatric patients at a pediatric intensive care unit in turkey. methods: we reviewed the medical and laboratory records of 29 critically ill children who were treated with colistin for 38 courses between january 2011 and december 2011 at the department of pediatric intensive care unit in ankara university medical school, turkey. results: the median age was 17 months (range 3-217 months). male-to-female ratio  was 1:1.37. ventilator-associated pneumonia (21 courses) was the leading diagnosis followed by catheter-related blood stream infection (6 courses), bacteremia (4 courses), ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection, peritonitis and pneumonia (1 course). the most commonly isolated microorganisms were acinetobacter baumanni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and enterobacter cloacae. two colistin  formulations were used. colimycin (kocak farma) was used in 21 colistin treatment episodes. the median dosage of colistin in this group was 5.0 mg/kg/d (2.3-5.6 mg/kg/d). colomycin (forest laboratories) was used in 17 colistin treatment episodes. the median dosage of colistin in the second group was 75,000 international unit/kg/d (50,000-80,000 international unit/kg/d). thirty colistin  treatment episodes (79%) had a good or partial clinical response and 8 (21%) had  a poor clinical response. of the 8 colistin treatment episodes with poor clinical response, 3 were in the colimycin group and 5 were in the colomycin group. ten patients died. there was no evidence of neurotoxicity in this study. nephrotoxicity was observed in 1 patient but was not attributed to colistin because the patient had multiorgan failure at the same time. conclusions: this study in a small cohort of patients suggests that the use of colistin in severe nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria is well-tolerated and efficacious.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of geranium oil against gram-negative bacteria isolated from difficult-to-heal wounds.
AB  == hard-to-heal wounds represent a significant problem to patients, health care professionals, and health care system. they can be formed as a result of mechanical injuries and burns, and any co-existing chronic disease increases the  risk of their emergence. diabetics are at a greater risk of developing chronic wounds because of poor circulation, slow healing times, vascular disease and neuropathy. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of  geranium oil against gram-negative bacterial clinical strains. clinical strains were isolated from patients with difficult-to-treat wounds and a comprehensive evaluation of their sensitivity to antibiotics was carried out. the constituents  of geranium oil were specified by gc-fid-ms analysis. the micro-dilution broth method was used to check the inhibition of microbial growth at various concentrations of geranium oil. the tested geranium oil was efficacious against gram-negative pathogens responsible for problems with wound treatment. the results suggest that geranium oil may be considered an effective component of therapy in the case of frequent recurrences of infections caused by resistant pathogens.

TI  == characterization of a novel pyranopyridine inhibitor of the acrab efflux pump of  escherichia coli.
AB  == members of the resistance-nodulation-division (rnd) family of efflux pumps, such  as acrab-tolc of escherichia coli, play major roles in multidrug resistance (mdr) in gram-negative bacteria. a strategy for combating mdr is to develop efflux pump inhibitors (epis) for use in combination with an antibacterial agent. here, we describe mbx2319, a novel pyranopyridine epi with potent activity against rnd efflux pumps of the enterobacteriaceae. mbx2319 decreased the mics of ciprofloxacin (cip), levofloxacin, and piperacillin versus e. coli ab1157 by 2-,  4-, and 8-fold, respectively, but did not exhibit antibacterial activity alone and was not active against acrab-tolc-deficient strains. mbx2319 (3.13 mum) in combination with 0.016 mug/ml cip (minimally bactericidal) decreased the viability (cfu/ml) of e. coli ab1157 by 10,000-fold after 4 h of exposure, in comparison with 0.016 mug/ml cip alone. in contrast, phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (pabetan), a known epi, did not increase the bactericidal activity of 0.016 mug/ml cip at concentrations as high as 100 mum. mbx2319 increased intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent dye hoechst 33342 in wild-type but not acrab-tolc-deficient strains and did not perturb the transmembrane proton gradient. mbx2319 was broadly active against enterobacteriaceae species and pseudomonas aeruginosa. mbx2319 is a potent epi with possible utility as an adjunctive therapeutic agent for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == change of antibiotic susceptibility testing guidelines from clsi to eucast: influence on cumulative hospital antibiograms.
AB  == objective: we studied whether the change in antibiotic susceptibility testing (ast) guidelines from clsi to eucast influenced cumulative antibiograms in a tertiary care hospital in switzerland. methods: antibiotic susceptibilities of non-duplicate isolates collected within a one-year period before (period a) and after (period b) changing ast interpretation from clsi 2009 to eucast 1.3 (2011)  guidelines were analysed. in addition, period b isolates were reinterpreted according to the clsi 2009, clsi 2013 and eucast 3.1 (2013) guidelines. results:  the majority of species/drug combinations showed no differences in susceptibility rates comparing periods a and b. however, in some gram-negative bacilli, decreased susceptibility rates were observed when comparing clsi 2009 with eucast 1.3 within period b: escherichia coli / cefepime, 95.8% (clsi 2009) vs. 93.1% (eucast 1.3), p=0.005; enterobacter cloacae / cefepime, 97.0 (clsi 2009) vs. 90.5% (eucast 1.3), p=0.012; pseudomonas aeruginosa / meropenem, 88.1% (clsi 2009) vs. 78.3% (eucast 1.3), p=0.002. these differences were still evident when  comparing susceptibility rates according to the clsi 2013 guideline with eucast 3.1 guideline. for p. aeruginosa and imipenem, a trend towards a lower antibiotic susceptibility rate in icus compared to general wards turned into a significant difference after the change to eucast: 87.9% vs. 79.8%, p=0.08 (clsi 2009) and 86.3% vs. 76.8%, p=0.048 (eucast 1.3). conclusions: the change of ast guidelines  from clsi to eucast led to a clinically relevant decrease of susceptibility rates in cumulative antibiograms for defined species/drug combinations, particularly in those with considerable differences in clinical susceptibility breakpoints between the two guidelines.

TI  == bi-directional-bi-dimensionality alignment of self-supporting mn3o4 nanorod and nanotube arrays with different bacteriostasis and magnetism.
AB  == self-supported mn3o4 patterns of aligned nanorods and nanotubes were synthesized  through a bi-directional-bi-dimensionality growth model by using sodium gluconate and urea as additives under mild hydrothermal conditions without the use of any substrates. in one direction, mn3o4 grows to form one-dimensional nanorods or nanotubes, while in the other direction mn3o4 grows into two-dimensional nanoplates to support the nanorods or nanotubes to align into arrays. these two kinds of new nanostructures, a nanotube pattern and a nanorod pattern, show similar and good bacteriostasis for gram positive bacteria, but for gram negative bacteria the nanotube pattern shows much better bacterial restraint than the nanorod pattern. magnetic studies show that the nanorod arrays display similar magnetic properties to the commercial mn3o4, while the nanotube arrays show different ferromagnetic behaviors with enhanced remnant magnetization and saturation magnetization (ms) at low temperature.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

TI  == kinetics of avibactam inhibition against class a, c, and d beta-lactamases.
AB  == avibactam is a non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor with a spectrum of activity that includes beta-lactamase enzymes of classes a, c, and selected d examples. in this work acylation and deacylation rates were measured against the  clinically important enzymes ctx-m-15, kpc-2, enterobacter cloacae ampc, pseudomonas aeruginosa ampc, oxa-10, and oxa-48. the efficiency of acylation (k2/ki) varied across the enzyme spectrum, from 1.1 x 10(1) m(-1)s(-1) for oxa-10 to 1.0 x 10(5) for ctx-m-15. inhibition of oxa-10 was shown to follow the covalent reversible mechanism, and the acylated oxa-10 displayed the longest residence time for deacylation, with a half-life of greater than 5 days. across multiple enzymes, acyl enzyme stability was assessed by mass spectrometry. these  inhibited enzyme forms were stable to rearrangement or hydrolysis, with the exception of kpc-2. kpc-2 displayed a slow hydrolytic route that involved fragmentation of the acyl-avibactam complex. the identity of released degradation products was investigated, and a possible mechanism for the slow deacylation from kpc-2 is proposed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  == purpose: cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (bsis). most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. we here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in bsis in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. methods: we analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between january 2005 and january 2011. results: a total of 4,918 episodes of bsi  occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). in both patient groups, gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). amongst gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. amongst gram-negative organisms, escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following bsi compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. conclusion: these data demonstrate distinct bsi pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.

AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == [monitoring of hospital infections in cardiac surgery ward].
AB  == introduction: the development of techniques applied in cardiac surgery changed the profile of operated patients. patients with small lesions within the cardiovascular system are treated using invasive cardiology. the occurrence of infections is directly related to the type of surgery and the implanted material. many hospitals, even in the developed countries, contend with hospital infections, which are the source of serious clinical and economic problems. paradoxically, problems associated with hospital infections have grown worse along with advances in medicine and the implementation of new invasive diagnostic methods. cardiac surgery wards are specialist units, where infections among patients are quite common. hospital infections are dangerous for patients' health and even life. they also contribute to the failure of therapy. therefore, the awareness of infections and their reasons, which may help to control and eliminate this problem, is so important. the aim of this study was an annual forward-looking analysis of hospital infections in the cardiac surgery ward, which included: patients' profiles, clinical forms of infections, aetiological factors and infection risk factors in patients with various types of cardiac surgical procedures. material and methods: this forward-looking study involved all patients hospitalised in the cardiac surgery clinic, the pomeranian medical university of szczecin in the period 1.01-31.12.2008. the total number of participants was 1127, including 804 (71.3%) men and 323 (28.7%) women. analysis  of procedures used in cardiac surgery wards so far and the offer of optimal prevention measures. each patient had his/her own infection registration card. the material for microbiological tests was taken in accordance with a routine procedure once a week or in cases of suspected infections. conclusions: 1. infections were detected in 7.2% of patients. 2. death rates among patients with  infections was higher in women than in men (46.2% vs 33.3%). 3. the most common clinical forms of infection were pneumonia (44.4%), sepsis (42.0%) and surgical site infection (33.3%), however every infected patient had 1-4 clinical forms. 4. the most common aetiological factors of infection, irrespective of a clinical form, were gram-negative rods with the prevalence of enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 5. patient-related infection risk factors included overweight and womens' age > 72, while a statistically significant increase in the incidence of infections was found in patients who had not received anti-thrombosis treatment. 6. infection risk factors associated with treatment and specificity of the cardiac surgery ward were mainly: artificial ventilation > 24 h, the necessity for reoperation, a blood transfusion, pressor administration, treatment complications, as well as not using extracorporeal circulation and surgical site drainage. 7. risk factors related to treatment complications included mainly: circulatory problems, renal insufficiency, respiratory insufficiency, low cardiac output syndrome and ischaemic cerebral stroke. 8. there were no correlations between infections and the course of surgery, the type of a prosthesis (mechanical/biological) or catheterization of vessels and the bladder. 9. the presented results enable the analysis of procedures used in cardiac surgery wards so far and the offer of optimal prevention measures.

AB  == data on biliary carriage of bacteria and, specifically, of bacteria with worrisome and unexpected resistance traits (urb) are lacking. a prospective study (april 2010 to december 2011) was performed that included all patients admitted for <48 h for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a spanish hospital. bile samples were cultured and epidemiological/clinical data recorded. logistic regression models (stepwise) were performed using bactobilia or bactobilia by urb as dependent variables. models (p < 0.001) showing the highest r(2) values were considered. a total of 198 patients (40.4% males; age, 55.3 +/- 17.3 years) were  included. bactobilia was found in 44 of them (22.2%). the presence of bactobilia  was associated (r(2) cox, 0.30) with previous biliary endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) (odds ratio [or], 8.95; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.96 to 27.06; p < 0.001), previous admission (or, 2.82; 95% ci, 1.10 to 7.24; p = 0.031), and age (or, 1.09 per year; 95% ci, 1.05 to 1.12; p < 0.001). ten out of the 44 (22.7%) patients with bactobilia carried urb: 1 escherichia coli isolate (ctx-m), 1 klebsiella pneumoniae isolate (oxa-48), 3 high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci, 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolate, 3  enterobacter cloacae strains, and 1 imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa strain. bactobilia by urb (versus those by non-urb) was only associated (r(2) cox, 0.19) with previous ercp (or, 11.11; 95% ci, 1.98 to 62.47; p = 0.006). for  analyses of patients with bactobilia by urb versus the remaining patients, previous ercp (or, 35.284; 95% ci, 5.320 to 234.016; p < 0.001), previous intake  of antibiotics (or, 7.200; 95% ci, 0.962 to 53.906; p = 0.050), and age (or, 1.113 per year of age; 95% ci, 1.028 to 1.206; p = 0.009) were associated with bactobilia by urb (r(2) cox, 0.19; p < 0.001). previous antibiotic exposure (in addition to age and previous ercp) was a risk driver for bactobilia by urb. this  may have implications in prophylactic/therapeutic measures.

TI  == detection of the carbapenemase gim-1 in enterobacter cloacae in germany.
AB  == objectives: to characterize the mechanisms involved in reduced susceptibility to  carbapenems in two enterobacter cloacae clinical isolates. methods: two e. cloacae isolates recovered from different regions in germany and showing reduced  susceptibility to carbapenems were analysed. susceptibility testing, conjugation, transformation assays, plasmid analysis, sequencing and molecular typing using rep-pcr were performed. results: the two clinical isolates carried the bla(gim-1) gene and showed resistance to ertapenem, with variable mic values of imipenem and meropenem. the isolates were clonally unrelated. the bla(gim-1) gene was located  on self-transferable and non-typeable plasmids. both isolates harboured distinct  plasmids and integron structures containing the bla(gim-1) gene cassette. interestingly, one of the two plasmids was able to replicate in pseudomonas aeruginosa, demonstrating its broad host range. conclusions: this is the first identification in e. cloacae of the bla(gim-1) gene, which is responsible for reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. we showed that this gene, previously identified in p. aeruginosa, was located in a different genetic background in e.  cloacae. the bla(gim-1) gene might spread quite efficiently in enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, as it is difficult to detect and in addition is located on conjugative plasmids.

TI  == verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential pcr gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  == aims: to verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (late-pcr) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., klebsiella sp., acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus,  enterobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus sp., candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. methods and results: clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the university of california, davis medical center (ucdmc) microbiology laboratory. five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. dna extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), ac. baumannii (57%) and ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). all clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two ac. baumannii, two klebsiella oxytoca and two candida parapsilosis isolates. conclusions: sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex late-pcr assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. the multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with dna extracted from 70 different target strains. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates the potential of late-pcr to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.

TI  == the target of daptomycin is absent from escherichia coli and other gram-negative  pathogens.
AB  == antistaphylococcal agents commonly lack activity against gram-negative bacteria like escherichia coli owing to the permeability barrier presented by the outer membrane and/or the action of efflux transporters. when these intrinsic resistance mechanisms are artificially compromised, such agents almost invariably demonstrate antibacterial activity against gram negatives. here we show that this is not the case for the antibiotic daptomycin, whose target appears to be absent  from e. coli and other gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == antibiotics involved in the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria: a nationwide multilevel study suggests differences within antibiotic classes.
AB  == objectives: to identify the antibiotics potentially the most involved in the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from an ecological perspective in french healthcare facilities (hcfs). methods: this study was based on data from the french antimicrobial surveillance network (atb-raisin, 2007-09). antibiotics  were expressed in defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days. antibiotic-resistant bacteria were considered as count data adjusted for patient-days. these were third-generation cephalosporin (3gc)- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli, cefotaxime-resistant enterobacter cloacae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ceftazidime-, imipenem- and ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. three-level negative binomial regression models were built to take into account the hierarchical structure of data: level 1, repeated  measures each year (count outcome, time, antibiotics); level 2, hcfs (type and size); and level 3, regions (geographical area). results: a total of 701 hcfs from 20 french regions and up to 1339 hcf-years were analysed. the use of ceftriaxone, but not of cefotaxime, was positively correlated with incidence rates of 3gc- and ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli. in contrast, both 3gcs were positively correlated with the incidence rate of cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae. higher levels of use of ciprofloxacin and/or ofloxacin, but not of levofloxacin,  were associated with higher incidence rates of 3gc- and ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and ceftazidime- and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa. conclusions: our study suggests differences within antibiotic classes in promoting antibiotic resistance. we identified ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin as priority targets in public health strategies designed to reduce antibiotic use and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in french hcfs.

TI  == discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  == abstract. a method, based on raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed.  spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (gram-negative: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, and gram-positive: staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a raman spectrometer with a fiber raman probe (830 nm). colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for raman measurements. after preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and mahalanobis distance (pca/md) discrimination algorithm. we found that the mean raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and s. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. pca/md could discriminate gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.

TI  == artemisia capillaris extracts as a green factory for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles with antibacterial activities.
AB  == we report a green synthesis of silver nanoparticles that uses extracts from the aerial part of artemisia capillaris. both water and 70% ethanol extracts successfully generated silver nanoparticles. the formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance bands, fourier transform-infrared spectra, high resolution-transmission electron and atomic force microscopic images. various shapes of silver nanoparticles were generated with an average diameter of 29.71 nm with water extract and 29.62 nm with 70% ethanol extract. an improvement in antibacterial activity (mic 8.35-16.7 microg/ml) was observed against a total of twenty different strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. a remarkable enhancement (approximately 12-fold) was observed against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella areogenes when compared  with the extract alone. silver nanoparticles produced by the 70% ethanol extract  showed slightly higher antibacterial activity than those generated with the water extract. the correlation between total flavonoid content of each extract and the  antibacterial activity did not exert any significant relationships. this report suggests that plant extracts have the potential to be used as powerful reducing agents for the production of biocompatible silver nanoparticles possessing enhanced antibacterial activities.

TI  == is there a direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a?
AB  == study type--therapy (case series) level of evidence 4. what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? several studies describe a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after intradetrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin a (bont/a). it was, however, unclear if a direct antibacterial effect of bont/a plays a role  in this clinical observation. this is the first study to investigate a potential  antibacterial effect of two frequently used bont/a formulations (i.e. botox(r) and dysport(r)), providing evidence that bont/a does not exert an antibacterial effect on lower urinary tract pathogens. objective: * to determine a potential direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a). materials and methods: * a prospective study was carried out using onabotulinumtoxin a (botox(r)) and abobotulinumtoxin a (dypsort(r)) in agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays with various clinical urinary tract isolates (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and bacillus subtilis). * inhibition zones (mm) of bacteria around a disc containing 20 microl saline with 4 iu of botox(r) were measured in the agar diffusion assay. * minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics, iu/ml) of both toxins for all bacteria were determined in the broth microdilution assay after overnight incubation at 35 degrees c. results: * there was no inhibition zone in the agar diffusion assays with any bacterial strain. * the microdilution test using botox(r) and dysport(r) showed bacterial growth in all dilutions, i.e. mics > 20 and >100 iu/ml for botox(r) and dysport(r), respectively. conclusions: * bont/a has no direct antimicrobial effect. * the reduced frequency of symptomatic urinary tract infections (sutis) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (ndo) after  bont/a intradetrusor injections seems to be caused by different indirect mechanisms, which are still not completely understood.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

AB  == a strain of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bmk2005 isolated from healthy infant faeces has shown a remarkable antibacterial activity against 32 bacterial pathogenic strains of human clinical isolates. among them, 13 strains belonging to species of escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to cefotaxime (ctx) and ceftazidime (caz), and 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus were resistant to methicillin (mrsa). this antibacterial activity was attributed to a bacteriocin designated as paracaseicin a. it was heat-stable up to 120 degrees c for 5 min and active within the ph range of 2-5.  its activity was lost when treated with proteases, which reveals its proteinaceous nature. this bacteriocin was successfully purified only by two steps of reversed phase chromatography. its molecular mass, determined by mass spectrometry analysis, was 2,462.5 da. to our knowledge, the present study is the first report on characterization and purification of a bacteriocin, produced by a l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strain exhibiting an antibacterial activity against various multidrug-resistant species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria,  which reveals its potential for use in prevention or treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant species especially in cases of antibiotics-associated diarrhea (aad).

TI  == seasonality in gram-negative and healthcare-associated infections.
AB  == to assess seasonal variations in gram-negative and healthcare-associated infections (hcais), a literature search was performed with combinations of the keywords 'seasonality', 'seasonal variations', 'gram-negative bacilli', 'infections', 'nosocomial infections', and 'health care associated infections', to retrieve articles published in english in peer-reviewed journals from 1 january 1970 to 29 february 2012. seasonality was demonstrated for infections, mostly bloodstream infections (bsis), caused by acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, with higher rates of infection during the summer months in north america, europe, the  middle east, australia, and asia. correlations were observed between temperature  increase and rates of bsi for acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae. a significant correlation between lower urinary tract infections and higher temperature and decreased relative humidity could explain the seasonality of some bsis. regarding hcai, seasonality is intrinsically present in most viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, because viruses are introduced into hospitals during seasonal community outbreaks. other  hcais subject to seasonal variations include surgical wound infections, with winter peaks in the usa and summer peaks in finland, central-line-associated bsis in haematology/oncology paediatric outpatients, and dialysis-associated peritonitis. in summary, seasonal variations have been shown for infections caused by many gram-negative bacilli, as well as for a few hcais, but many studies remain to be performed in order to better understand the mechanisms of these variations.

TI  == new role of antibody in bacterial isolation.
AB  == to eliminate the interference caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa in the isolation of salmonella, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against p. aeruginosa was prepared by inoculating four new zealand rabbits with the pathogen. the antiserum was purified using saturated ammonium sulfate and added into rappaport-vassiliadis medium with soya (rvs) broth and muller-kauffmann tetrathionate novobiocin broth  (mkttn broth) to evaluate whether it could inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa. observations by scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that p. aeruginosa was  attacked and destroyed by the antibody when incubated for 10 min at 37 degrees c. the activity of the antibody was also effective against 11 other strains of p. aeruginosa. twenty-six strains of salmonella were mixed with p. aeruginosa in rvs and mkttn broth at 37 degrees c for 12 h, respectively, and the cultures were plated on salmonella chromogenic medium (scm; oxoid, basingstoke, uk). only salmonella grew on scm; five colonies were randomly selected for identification by vitek 2 (biomerieux, lyon, france). additionally, when mixed with two strains  of enterobacter cloacae (atcc 700323 and yg001), the prepared antibody did not affect the growth of e. cloacae. the results demonstrated that the microbicidal activity of the antibody did not affect the tested salmonella sp. or e. cloacae strains. therefore, the antibody generated could be used to increase the accuracy of salmonella isolation.

TI  == a 9-year retrospective review of antibiotic cycling in a surgical intensive care  unit.
AB  == background: six years after initiating a monthly antibiotic cycling protocol in the surgical intensive care unit (sicu), we retrospectively reviewed antibiogram-derived sensitivities of predominant gram-negative pathogens before and after antibiotic cycling. we also examined susceptibility patterns in the medical intensive care unit (micu) where antibiotic cycling is not practiced. materials and methods: antibiotic cycling protocol was implemented in the sicu starting in 2003, with monthly rotation of piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastin, and ceftazidime. sicu antibiogram data from positive clinical  cultures for years 2000 and 2002 were included in the pre-cycling period, and those from 2004 to 2009 in the cycling period. results: profiles of sicu pseudomonal isolates before (n = 116) and after (n = 205) implementing antibiotic cycling showed statistically significant improvements in susceptibility to ceftazidime (66% versus 81%; p = 0.003) and piperacillin/tazobactam (75% versus 85%; p = 0.021), while susceptibility to imipenem remained unaltered (70% in each case; p = 0.989). susceptibility of e. coli isolates to piperacillin/tazobactam improved significantly (46% versus 83%; p < 0.0005), trend analysis showing this  improvement to persist over the study period (p = 0.025). similar findings were not observed in the micu. review of 2004-2009 antibiotic prescription practices showed monthly heterogeneity in the sicu, and a 2-fold higher prescribing of piperacillin/tazobactam in the micu (p < 0.0001). conclusions: six years into antibiotic cycling, we found either steady or improved susceptibilities of clinically relevant gram-negative organisms in the sicu. how much of this effect  is from cycling is unknown, but the antibiotic heterogeneity provided by this practice justifies its ongoing use.

TI  == temporal variation of microbiological and chemical quality of noncarbonated bottled drinking water sold in sri lanka.
AB  == use of bottled water in sri lanka has increased over the last decade, while new brands of bottled water are often introduced to the market. however, the manufacturers' adherence to bottled water regulations is questionable, raising concerns regarding the quality of bottled water. the objective of the current study was to investigate the microbiological and chemical quality of bottled water in sri lanka. thirty bottled water brands were sampled and their chemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed. microbiological analysis was carried out within 1 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 9, and 9 to 12 mo after the date of manufacture. the results indicated that 63% of brands tested exceeded the levels  permitted by the sri lanka standards institution (slsi) for presumptive total coliforms (tc) (<10 cfu per 100 ml) whereas 97% brands exceeded the world health  organization (who) permitted level. thirty percent of brands exceeded the limit for presumptive fecal coliforms (fc) (0 cfu per 100 ml in accordance with who permitted levels, slsi and the sri lanka health ministry requirement). eighty percent of brands showed higher heterotrophic plate counts (hpc) which exceeded the who guidelines for bottled drinking water. throughout their shelf life, the counts of tc, fc, and hpc bacteria decreased. bacteria identified were klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pasteurella haemolytica, the most frequently being p. aeruginosa. the dominant fungi identified were aspergillus sp. and penicillium sp. inorganic chemical parameters were within permitted levels for all brands except for initial content of ammonia. the results of this study show the need for the bottling industry to  be monitored closely by relevant authorities, in order to provide safe bottled drinking water to consumers in sri lanka.

TI  == complications of port-a-cath(r) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  == background: red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (scd). however, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (cvcs) in adult patients with moderate or severe scd. aims: to review our experience with the use of the port-a-cath((r)) device in sixteen patients with scd undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. methods: among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen scd  patients required the insertion of a port-a-cath((r)) device. these patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- sd]. a  total of 24 port-a-cath((r)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. results: out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. the organisms involved were candida spp. (3), c. parapsilosis (2), c. albicans (1), c. famata (1), c. lusitanice (1), staphylococcus spp. (6), and s. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (1), diphtheroid bacilli (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), ps. spp. (3), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), klebsiella spp. (1), serratia liquefaciens (1), serratia fanticola (1), achromobacter spp. (2) chromobacterium violaceum (1), delftia acidovirans (1), stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), alcaligenes faecalis (1), and enterobacter cloacae (1). two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. one case presented with right atrial thrombosis/svc syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. the median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). the rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. discussion: our results suggest that patients with scd suffer infective complications associated  with the port-a-cath((r)), which often necessitate its removal. although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.

TI  == endowashers: an overlooked risk for possible post-endoscopic infections.
AB  == background: prevention of post-endoscopy infections is an important objective to  assure patient safety. endowashers, or high throughput irrigation water pumps, are a frequently used device on endoscopes. recommendations published by professional bodies and regulatory health agencies cover not only adequate reprocessing of fiber-endoscopes but also state accepted methods of regular microbial sampling. although major instruments like endoscopes are covered by these recommendations, other devices used as optional add-ons for endoscopes are  not included. objective: the aim of this prospective study was to investigate the potential for endowashers to act as a possible source of infection. method: 24 endowashers were sampled. sterile rinse-water was pumped through the endowasher and tested microbiologically according to standardised tests. sampling was performed in 18 hospitals, including 2 university teaching hospitals, in northern germany. if endowashers were contaminated, devices were reprocessed and re-tested. results: of 44 samples, 6 (14%) were contaminated with pathogens of up to >20,000 cfu/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative non-fermenters  such as stenotrophomonas spp. (18x) and acinetobacter spp. (2x), followed by staphylococcus aureus (1x), enterobacter cloacae (1x), candida albicans (1x), serratia spp. (1x), streptococcus spp. (1x) and others (2x). conclusion: endowashers can be a potential source of infection. despite their common use, they are not routinely sampled microbiologically. endowashers should be clearly mentioned in respective guidelines and routine quality control sampling of endowashers should be part of such recommendations. if endowashers are not monitored regularly, devices with single-use hoses should be used.

TI  == effects of silver-based wound dressings on the bacterial flora in chronic leg ulcers and its susceptibility in vitro to silver.
AB  == silver-based dressings have been used extensively in wound management in recent years, but data on their antimicrobial activity in the clinical setting are limited. in order to explore their effects on chronic leg ulcer flora, 14 ulcers  were cultured after at least 3 weeks treatment with aquacel ag((r)) or acticoat((r)). phenotypic and genetic silver resistance were investigated in a total of 56 isolates. silver-based dressings had a limited effect on primary wound pathogens, which were present in 79% of the cultures before, and 71% after, treatment. one silver-resistant enterobacter cloacae strain was identified (silver nitrate minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) > 512 mg/l, positive for sile, sils and silp). further studies in vitro showed that inducible silver-resistance was more frequent in enterobacteriaceae with cephalosporin-resistance and that silver nitrate had mainly a bacteriostatic effect on staphylococcus aureus. monitoring of silver resistance should be considered in areas where silver is used extensively.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections after liver transplantation - spectrum and risk factors.
AB  == objectives: gram-negative bacilli infections, especially multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli infections, are the leading cause of high mortality after liver transplantation. this study sought to investigate the type of infection, infection rate, pathogenic spectrum, antibiotic-resistance profile, risk factors, and epidemiology of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infection. methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted and data of 217 liver transplant patients receiving cadaveric livers between january 2007 and april 2010 were analyzed. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration test. extended-spectrum and metallo-beta-lactamase assays were used to analyze beta-lactamase-produced isolates, and repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate bacterium subspecies. results: sixty-seven isolates of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 66 infected liver transplant patients. stenotrophomonas maltophilia (100%, 8/8), klebsiella pneumoniae (61.5%, 8/13), enterobacter cloacae (75%, 3/4) and escherichia coli (81.3%, 13/16) were the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacilli. metallo-beta-lactamase expressing isolates were identified as s. maltophilia (100%, 8/8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (83.3%, 5/6), acinetobacter baumannii (95%, 19/20). significant independent risk factors for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infection were extended use of pre-transplant broad-spectrum antibiotics (or 9.027, p=0.001) and prolonged (>==72h) endotracheal intubation (or 3.537, p=0.033). conclusions: to reduce the risk of acquiring mdr gram-negative bacillus infections after liver transplant, control measures are required to limit the use of prophylactic antibiotic in preventing infection during liver transplant and to shorten endotracheal intubation time.

TI  == enhanced antibacterial activities of leonuri herba extracts containing silver nanoparticles.
AB  == we report an efficient and powerful green process to enhance the antibacterial activities of the leonuri herba extract. plant sources, especially leaves and herbs, are precious for the generation of gold and silver nanoparticles. various  kinds of polyphenols and hydroxyl groups are capable of processing a reduction reaction to generate metals from its corresponding salts. we have prepared gold and silver nanoparticles with 70% ethanol and water extracts. no other toxic chemicals were utilized and the extracts played dual roles as reducing and stabilizing agents. for the generation of nanoparticles, both oven incubation and autoclaving methods were applied and the reaction conditions were optimized. surface plasmon resonance band indicated that the formation of nanoparticles was  successful. images of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed mostly spherical nanoparticles ranging from 9.9 to 13.0 nm in size. a water extract containing silver nanoparticles exhibited remarkable (approximately 127-fold) enhancement in antibacterial activities against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae when compared with the water extract alone. in addition, antibacterial activity towards gram-negative bacteria was greater than that against gram-positive bacteria. the process reported here has the potential to be a new approach to improve the antibacterial activities of plant extracts.

TI  == [investigation of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients].
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa which is widely found in the environment, may lead to serious nosocomial infections. due to its intrinsic resistance to many antibacterial agents, treatment of p.aeruginosa infections usually present difficulty. quinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, are crutial antibiotics for the treatment of p.aeruginosa infections. however resistance developing to quinolones may become an important problem. resistance to quinolones is often a result of chromosomal mutations and by the effect of efflux pumps. recently plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance have been reportedin the members of enterobacteriaceae family. the gene responsible for this resistance is called qnr. in addition to qnr genes there is also another gene called aac(6)-ib-cr responsible for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and aminoglycoside resistance. limited studies which to screen p.aeruginosa strains for the presence of qnr gene region, revealed no positivity. the aim of this study was to investigate the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in p.aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. a total of 110 p.aeruginosa strains isolated from respiratory tract specimens from the patients were included in the  study. ciprofloxacin susceptibilities of the isolates were detected by kirby-bauer disk diffusion method according to clsi guidelines. the presence of qnra, qnrb, qnrc, qnrs and aac(6')-ib-cr genes were searched by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with the use of specific individual primer pairs. as positive control strains, escherichia coli j53 pmg252 (qnra1 positive), e.coli j53 pmg252 (qnrs1 positive), e.coli j53 pmg258 (qnrb1 and aac(6')-ib-cr positive), klebsiella pneumoniae ref.15 (qnrb positive), enterobacter cloacae ref.287 (qnrs positive), e.coli ref.20 (qnra positive) and e.coli dh10 conjugated with phs11 plasmid (qnrc positive) were used. of 110 p.aeruginosa clinical isolates, 13 were found resistant to ciprofloxacin, while 7 were intermediate. however multiplex pcr yielded no positivity in terms of qnra, qnrb, qnrc, qnrs and aac(6')-ib-cr gene regions. in conclusion, although our results indicated that none of the tested p.aeruginosa strains harboured those genes, further multicenter studies with large numbers of isolates are needed to confirm these results.

AB  == the present study investigated the pharmacokinetics of meropenem and biapenem in  bile and estimated their pharmacodynamic target attainment at the site. meropenem (0.5 g) or biapenem (0.3 g) was administered to surgery patients (n = 8 for each  drug). venous blood samples and hepatobiliary tract bile samples were obtained at the end of infusion (0.5 h) and for up to 5 h thereafter. drug concentrations in  plasma and bile were analyzed pharmacokinetically and used for a monte carlo simulation to predict the probability of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (40% of the time above the mic). both drugs penetrated similarly into bile, with  mean bile/plasma ratios of 0.24 to 0.25 (maximum drug concentration) and 0.30 to  0.38 (area under the drug concentration-time curve). the usual regimens of meropenem (0.5 g every 8 h [q8h]) and biapenem (0.3 g q8h) (0.5-h infusions) achieved similar target attainment probabilities in bile (>/= 90%) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae isolates. however, against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, meropenem at 1 g q8h and biapenem at 0.6 g q8h were required for values of 80.7% and 71.9%, respectively.  the biliary pharmacodynamic-based breakpoint (the highest mic at which the target attainment probability in bile was >/= 90%) was 1 mg/liter for 0.5 g q8h and 2 mg/liter for 1 g q8h for meropenem and 0.5 mg/liter for 0.3 g q8h and 1 mg/liter  for 0.6 g q8h for biapenem. these results help to define the clinical pharmacokinetics of the two carbapenems in bile while also helping to rationalize and optimize the dosing regimens for biliary tract infections based on site-specific pharmacodynamic target attainment.

TI  == composition and antimicrobial activity of seseli globiferum essential oil.
AB  == the essential oil from aerial parts of seseli globiferum vis. obtained by hydrodistillation with clevenger-type apparatus was analyzed by gc-ms. twenty-eight compounds were identified, representing 99.4% of the total oil. the  main components of the oil were sabinene (38.0%), alpha-pinene (21.2%) and beta-phellandrene (13.5%). the microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species: salmonella typhimurium (atcc 13311), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), enterobacter cloacae (clinical isolates), bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 12228), micrococcus flavus (atcc 10240) and three fungal species: aspergillus niger (atcc 6275), aspergillus versicolor (atcc 11730), trichoderma viride (iam 5061) and penicillium funiculosum (atcc 36839). the essential oil showed activity against bacteria p. aeruginosa, followed by m flavus, l. monocytigenes and e. coli, and all investigated fungal species.

TI  == biosorption kinetics of cu (ii) ions removal from aqueous solution using bacteria.
AB  == the present study highlights the effective removal of cu (ii) ions from synthetic solution using bacteria such as b. subtilis, p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae. batch  biosorption studies show that the biosorption of b. subtilis is effective when the concentration ranges from 25-200 mg l(-1). biomass dosage, ph and the initial metal ion concentration have a profound effect on the biosorption process and this is reported in this study. in order to understand the nature of the biosorption process, langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied. pseudo first and second order models were used to study the biosorption kinetics. the results show that these bacterial strains are very much suitable for the removal  of cu (ii) ions. being cost effective and efficient in toxic metal ion removal, these bacteria can be used on a large scale.

AB  == the molecular epidemiology of vim-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated at the beginning of an epidemic in the intensive care unit (icu) of a university hospital in athens, greece, was studied. all gram-negative organisms isolated from march 2004 to november 2005 positive for metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) production were submitted to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing, to repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) for molecular typing, and to s1 nuclease  digestion for plasmid dna characterisation. conjugation experiments and isoelectric focusing were performed to identify co-existing beta-lactamases. amongst 23 patients, 12 suffered one or more clinical infections. eighty-two isolates representing one isolate per clone, source and icu patient were studied, including klebsiella pneumoniae (77), enterobacter cloacae (2), citrobacter freundii (1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2). high clonal diversity was detected amongst the k. pneumoniae, with 10 distinct clones identified. conjugation was successful in 54.5% of k. pneumoniae, and five different-sized plasmids were detected. all k. pneumoniae and both e. cloacae isolates shared the same bla(vim-1)-containing class 1 integron structure also carrying aaca7, dhfri and aada1 gene cassettes. the c. freundii isolate carried a different integron that included bla(vim-1) and aac(6')-iic. both p. aeruginosa isolates were positive for bla(vim-2). it was not possible to identify specific clones with the potential to cause clinical infections. in conclusion, a multiclonal cluster of mbl-producers was responsible for the first cases of colonisation and/or infection in the icu. a single integron structure, common in greek hospitals, efficiently disseminated between clones and species, suggesting that the epidemic was mainly the result of successful horizontal transfer of mobile genetic material rather than the result of horizontal transfer of one or a few clones.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from vegetables with regards to the marketing stage (farm vs. supermarket).
AB  == the aim of this study was to elucidate whether and to what extent fresh produce from germany plays a role as a carrier and reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria. for this purpose, 1001 vegetables (fruit, root, bulbous vegetables, salads and cereals) were collected from 13 farms and 11 supermarkets in germany and examined bacteriologically. phenotypic resistance of enterobacter cloacae (n=172); enterobacter gergoviae (n=92); pantoea agglomerans (n=96); pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=295); pseudomonas putida (n=106) and enterococcus faecalis (n=100)  against up to 30 antibiotics was determined by using the microdilution method. resistance to ss-lactams was most frequently expressed by p. agglomerans and e. gergoviae against cefaclor (41% and 29%). relatively high resistance rates were also observed for doxycycline (23%), erythromycin (21%) and rifampicin (65%) in e. faecalis, for spectinomycin (28%) and mezlocillin (12%) in e. cloacae, as well as for streptomycin (19%) in p. putida. in p. aeruginosa, relatively low resistance rates were observed for the aminoglycosides amikacin, apramicin, gentamicin, neomycin, netilmicin and tobramycin (<4%); 11% was resistant to streptomycin. no glycopeptide-resistant enterococci were observed. resistance rates of bacteria isolated from farm samples were higher than those of the retail markets whenever significant differences were observed. this suggests that expressing resistance is at the expense of bacterial viability, since vegetables  purchased directly at the farm are probably fresher than at the supermarket, and  they have not been exposed to stress factors. however, this should not keep the customer from buying directly at the farm, since the overall resistance rates were not higher than observed in bacteria from human or animal origin. instead, peeling or washing vegetables before eating them raw is highly recommended, since it reduces not only the risk of contact with pathogens, but also that of ingesting and spreading antibiotic resistant bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

AB  == invasion by bacteria can influence the course of healing of wounds acquired in aquatic environment. in this study, the bacteria present in potamotrygon motoro stingray mucus and in the alto parana river water were identified, and their ability to induce tissue injury and resist antibiotics was determined. biochemical identification analysis showed that 97% of all bacterial isolates were gram negative, aeromonas spp., enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii being the species most prevalent. gelatinase and caseinase were produced by aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas sobria and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. erythrocyte hemolysis assay showed that a. sobria, a. hydrophila and to a lesser  extent, other gram-negative bacteria produced hemolysin. it was also observed that molecules released in culture by these bacteria were toxic to human epithelial cells. antibiogram results showed that 68% of all bacterial isolates were resistant to at least one type of antibiotic, mainly b-lactams. finally, it  was demonstrated that although p. motoro venom was toxic to epithelial cells it did not influence bacterial proliferation. in summary, the results obtained in this work indicate that during the accident, the mucus of p. motoro and the environmental water may transfer into the wound pathogenic multi-resistant bacteria with the potential to cause severe secondary infections.

TI  == correlation between antibiotic consumption and resistance of gram-negative bacteria causing healthcare-associated infections at a university hospital in taiwan from 2000 to 2009.
AB  == objectives: this study investigated the correlation between antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria causing healthcare-associated infections at a university hospital in taiwan from 2000 to  2009. methods: disc susceptibility data of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus spp., pseudomonas  aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli causing healthcare-associated infections were evaluated. data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days) of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fl uoroquinolones were analysed. results: the trend of total consumption of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones significantly increased between 2000 and 2003 and remained stable between 2004 and 2009. the decreasing use of gentamicin and amikacin in recent years was associated with increasing susceptibility of e. coli, e. cloacae, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa to gentamicin, as well as increasing susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to amikacin. the use of piperacillin/tazobactam was positively correlated with the prevalence  of piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant e. coli and s. maltophilia. in contrast, the use of cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam was negatively correlated with the  prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant e. coli and piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant  s. maltophilia, respectively. the consumption of fluoroquinolones was positively  correlated with the rates of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant p. aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant s. maltophilia. conclusions: the relationship between antibiotic prescription and the rates of resistance for gram-negative bacteria is complicated; every type of  antimicrobial agent or even individual agent can have distinct associations with  different pathogens.

AB  == background: vascular prosthetic graft infection is a severe complication after open aortic aneurysm repair. reports of infected endografts are scarce. general treatment consensus with infected graft material is that it should be removed completely. the objective of this study was to describe the incidence of endograft infection after endovascular repair of abdominal (evar) and thoracic aortic aneurysm (tevar) and to report treatment options and their outcome. methods: a retrospective cohort study was performed of patients endovascularly operated for abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm in two large hospitals (one tertiary referral center and one large community hospital) between march 1996 and june 2009. diagnosis of infected endograft was made based on clinical findings, blood tests and cultures, imaging studies (computed tomography, fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography), and intraoperative findings at reoperation. results: eleven patients with an infected endograft were identified in 1431 endovascular procedures. one other patient was referred from another hospital. patients were aged 68 +/- 9 years, and all but one were male. the median time from initial tevar/evar to the diagnosis of infection was 115 days (range, 7-3748 days), with 42% of patients presenting within 3 months after tevar/evar. seven patients were diagnosed with endograft infection after elective tevar/evar and five after emergency tevar/evar. the incidence was significantly higher in patients that were treated in an emergency setting (0.56% vs 2.79%; p = .002), while there was no significant difference between tevar and evar procedures (1.37% vs 0.77%). all patients were initially treated with antibiotic therapy, which was complemented with surgical intervention in six patients. in four patients, the infected graft material was completely explanted. isolated microorganisms included staphylococcus species (n = 4), streptococcus species (n  = 4), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), escherichia coli (n = 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), and listeria monocytogenes (n = 1). median time of follow-up  was 201 days (range, 6-2023 days). during the study period, three out of 12 patients died, of which two were treated conservatively (p = ns). at their last follow-up visit, seven of nine patients still used antimicrobial therapy. conclusions: the incidence of endograft infection is below 1%, with a mortality rate of 25%. although consensus is that infected graft material should always be  removed, this study shows no significant difference in mortality between the conservatively- and the surgically-managed group, possibly related to the small sample size. there may be a role for conservative treatment in selected cases of  patients with an infected endograft.

TI  == microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility of organisms in bile cultures from patients with and without cholangitis at an asian academic medical center.
AB  == purpose: to review the epidemiology of microbial isolates from bile cultures taken from patients with and without cholangitis admitted to an asian academic medical center in order to compare antimicrobial sensitivities and to make recommendations for empiric antimicrobial therapy of patients with cholangitis in the philippines. methods: routine aerobic bile culture results and corresponding  clinical abstracts of surgical patients admitted to an academic medical center over a three-year period were analyzed. results: the series consisted of 125 patients, 77 with cholangitis (62%) and 48 (38%) without, which was determined according to the tokyo guidelines. patients with cholangitis were significantly more likely to have positive bile cultures (p = 0.012). gram-negative bacilli were the most common isolates in both patients with (94%) and patients without (95%) cholangitis. for both groups, escherichia coli (36%) had greatest sensitivity to amikacin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, imipenem-cilastatin meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam; klebsiella pneumoniae (16%) had greatest  sensitivity to amikacin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, imipenem-cilastatin meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam; and pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%) was most sensitive to cefepime, gentamicin, imipenem-cilastatin meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli (or enterobacteriaceae) (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae) were the most common aerobic microbial isolates in bile cultures from patients with cholangitis in the philippines. their antimicrobial susceptibility  patterns suggest that imipenem-cilastatin (sensitivity 100%), meropenem (100%), amikacin (90-100%), cefepime (75%-100%), ceftriaxone (75%-100%), gentamicin (67%-100%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (50%-100%) would be the most effective antimicrobials for both groups. however, the authors echo the caution from the surgical infection society/infectious diseases society of america against using aminoglycosides as empiric drugs when safer and equally effective regimens are available.

TI  == diarrheagenic escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in north-west  italy.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. the aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic e. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. between march 2008 and june 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for e. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-pcr. e. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic e. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering e. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. the datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 salmonella spp., 8 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 klebsiella oxytoca, 11 citrobacter freundii, 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 serratia spp., 7 enterobacter cloacae, 1 shigella spp., 2 campylobacter spp. rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. it was found in 35 samples (21.88%  of the overall collected samples), while adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic e. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have  potential clinical implications. abbreviations: cdec, detaching e. coli; daec, diffusely adherent e. coli; eaggec, enteroaggregative e. coli; ehec, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli; eiec, enteroinvasive e. coli; epec, enteropathogenic  e. coli; etec, enterotoxigenic e. coli.

TI  == the prevention of biofilm colonization by multidrug-resistant pathogens that cause ventilator-associated pneumonia with antimicrobial-coated endotracheal tubes.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) continues to be the nosocomial infection associated with the highest mortality in critically ill patients. since silver-coated endotracheal tubes (ett) was shown in a multicenter prospective randomized trials to decrease the risk of vap, we compared the efficacy of two antiseptic agents such as gardine- and gendine-coated etts with that of silver-coated etts in preventing biofilm. the etts were tested for their ability  to prevent the biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and candida albicans. scanning electron microscopy studies  revealed a heavy biofilm on uncoated and silver-coated ett but not on the gardine-coated ett. the gardine and gendine etts completely inhibited the formation of biofilms by all organisms tested and were more effective in preventing biofilm growth than the silver etts (p < 0.001). the gardine- and gendine-coated etts were more durable against mrsa than either the silver-coated  or uncoated etts for up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001). we have therefore shown that gardine- and gendine-coated etts are superior to silver-coated etts in preventing biofilm. future animal and clinical studies are warranted to determine whether the gardine- and gendine-coated etts can significantly reduce the risk of vap.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == influence of referral bias on the clinical characteristics of patients with gram-negative bloodstream infection.
AB  == referral bias can influence the results of studies performed at tertiary-care centres. in this study, we evaluated demographic and microbiological factors that influenced referral of patients with gram-negative bloodstream infection (bsi). we identified 2919 and 846 unique patients with gram-negative bsi in a referral cohort of patients treated at mayo clinic hospitals and a population-based cohort of olmsted county, minnesota, residents between 1 january 1998 and 31 december 2007, respectively. multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with referral. elderly patients aged >/=80 years with gram-negative bsi were less likely to be referred than younger patients [odds ratio (or) 0.43, 95% confidence intervals (ci) 0.30-0.62] as were females (or 0.63, 95% ci 0.53-0.74). after adjusting for age and gender, bloodstream isolates of escherichia coli (or 0.50, 95% ci 0.43-0.58) and proteus mirabilis (or 0.49, 95% ci 0.30-0.82) were underrepresented in the referral cohort; and pseudomonas aeruginosa (or 2.26, 95% ci 1.70-3.06), enterobacter cloacae (or 2.31, 95% ci 1.53-3.66), serratia marcescens (or 2.34, 95% ci 1.33-4.52) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (or 17.94, 95% ci 3.98-314.43) were overrepresented  in the referral cohort. we demonstrated that demographic and microbiological characteristics of patients with gram-negative bsi had an influence on referral patterns. these factors should be considered when interpreting results of investigations performed at tertiary-care centres.

TI  == pharmacodynamic profiling of antimicrobials against gram-negative respiratory isolates from canadian hospitals.
AB  == background: with diminishing antimicrobial potency, the choice of effective empirical therapy has become more challenging. thus, the pharmacodynamic evaluation of potential therapies is essential to identify optimal agents, doses  and administration strategies. methods: monte carlo simulation was conducted for  standard and/or prolonged infusion regimens of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, doripenem, ertapenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. minimum inhibitory concentrations were obtained for escherichia coli (n=64 respiratory isolates), enterobacter cloacae (n=53), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=75) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=273) throughout canada. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) was calculated using bactericidal targets for each regimen against each species. a cfr >/=90% was defined as optimal. results: all cefepime, doripenem, ertapenem and meropenem regimens achieved optimal exposures against enterobacteriaceae, whereas target attainment was organism and dose dependent for the other agents. prolonged infusion doripenem and meropenem 1 g and 2 g every 8 h, along with standard infusion doripenem and meropenem 2 g every 8 h, were the only regimens to attain  optimal exposures against p aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin had the lowest cfr against  p aeruginosa, followed by cefepime. among the p aeruginosa isolates collected in  the intensive care unit (icu) compared with the wards, differences of 0.5% to 10% were noted in favour of non-icu isolates for all agents; however, marked differences (10% to 15%) in cfr were observed for ciprofloxacin in favour of icu  isolates. conclusion: standard dosing of cefepime, doripenem, ertapenem and meropenem has a high likelihood of obtaining optimal pharmacodynamic indexes against these enterobacteriaceae. for p aeruginosa, aggressive treatment with high-dose and/or prolonged infusion regimens are likely required to address the elevated resistance rates of respiratory isolates from canada.

TI  == urinary tract infection caused by carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa.
AB  == there has been an increase in recent years of antimicrobial resistance of gram negative bacilli (gnb). carbapenems, the mainstay for the treatment of multidrug  resistant gnb infections, are no longer always effective leaving treatment options limited. we present the case of patient with recurrent, complicated urinary tract infections. the current episode was caused by carbapenem-resistant  k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa and carbapenem-susceptible, but mdr e. cloacae. resistance to carbapenems of k. pneumoniae was conferred by the production of the class b metallo-beta-lactamase, vim1. infection control measures were implemented and following a 2-week course of treatment with colistin, the infection resolved  and the patient was discharged. we discuss the changes in the epidemiology, the mechanisms involved and the means of detecting carbapenem resistance in gnb. we would also like to stress the role of infection control measures in limiting patient-to-patient spread of mdr organisms which, are of paramount importance in  cases when few treatment options are left available.

TI  == bactericidal oncocin derivatives with superior serum stabilities.
AB  == the proline-rich antimicrobial peptide oncocin is remarkably active in vitro against a number of important gram-negative bacteria of concern to humans owing to their increasing resistance to antibiotics, i.e. enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenting species (acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa). degradation of oncocin in mouse serum was investigated in this study. several approaches to stabilise the main cleavage sites (c-terminal to arg-15 and n-terminal to arg-19) by substituting either or both arginine (arg) residues with non-proteinogenic amino acids, i.e. alpha-amino-3-guanidino-propionic acid, homoarginine, nitro-arginine, n-methyl-arginine, beta-homoarginine, d-arginine (d-arg) or ornithine (orn), were tested. these modifications were found to increase the half-life of oncocin in full mouse serum. for oncocin with two orn residues in positions 15 and 19, the half-life in full serum increased from 25 min to 3 h. an increase of >8 h was observed for oncocin with two d-arg residues  at these same positions. the antibacterial activities of these modified sequences were slightly better than the original oncocin sequence. moreover, the three most stable analogues were found to be bactericidal against e. coli and were not toxic to hela cells or haemolytic to human erythrocytes.

TI  == vejovine, a new antibiotic from the scorpion venom of vaejovis mexicanus.
AB  == multidrug resistant bacterial infections are one of the most important health problems in recent years. resistance to conventional antibiotics limits the therapeutic options causing increase rate in morbid-mortality in hospitals. therefore, new antibacterial agents with new bacterial targets have been searched and found in many different sources, including scorpion venom and scorpion hemolymph. here, we report a new anti-microbial peptide named vejovine. this peptide was isolated from the venom of the mexican scorpion vaejovis mexicanus by two steps of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc). it  is composed of 47 amino acid residues with no cysteine residues in its sequence,  with a molecular weight of 4873 da. the chemical synthesis of vejovine was performed by the solid phase method of merrifield, using fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (fmoc)-amino acids. both the native and synthetic peptides were shown to have essentially the same activity. vejovine inhibits growth of clinical isolates of gram-negative multidrug resistant (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumanii) causing nosocomial infections with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 4.4 mum up to 50 mum. this peptide has also hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes with a hc(50) value of 100 mum. a cdna library of the venomous gland of this scorpion provided material for cloning the  gene encoding vejovine. this peptide is a new type of antibiotic, showing less than 50% similarity to other known scorpion peptides. vejovine is a candidate to  be used as a leading compound for future development of an effective peptide against multidrug resistant bacteria.

TI  == synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  == maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. this study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal  bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin  for enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. a range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. the results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on s. aureus. minimal concentrations and mbc of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. the mbc of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against s. aureus were also decreased. the other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. the synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.

TI  == evaluation of the diversilab system for detection of hospital outbreaks of infections by different bacterial species.
AB  == many bacterial typing methods are specific for one species only, time-consuming,  or poorly reproducible. diversilab (dl; biomerieux) potentially overcomes these limitations. in this study, we evaluated the dl system for the identification of  hospital outbreaks of a number bacterial species. appropriately typed clinical isolates were tested with dl. dl typing agreed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) for acinetobacter (n = 26) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13) isolates. with two exceptions, dl typing of klebsiella isolates (n = 23) also correlated with pfge, and in addition, pfge-nontypeable (pfge-nt) isolates could be typed. enterobacter (n = 28) results also correlated  with pfge results; also, pfge-nt isolates could be clustered. in a larger study (n = 270), a cluster of 30 isolates was observed that could be subdivided by pfge. the results for escherichia coli (n = 38) correlated less well with an experimental multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (mlva) scheme. pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 52) showed only a limited number of amplification products for most isolates. when multiple pseudomonas isolates were assigned to a single type in dl, all except one showed multiple multilocus sequence types. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus generally also showed a limited number of amplification products. isolates that belonged to different outbreaks by other typing methods, including pfge, spa typing, and mlva, were grouped together in a number of cases. for enterococcus faecium, the limited variability  of the amplification products obtained made interpretation difficult and correlation with mlva and esp gene typing was poor. all of the results are reflected in simpson's index of diversity and adjusted rand's and wallace's coefficients. dl is a useful tool to help identify hospital outbreaks of acinetobacter spp., s. maltophilia, the enterobacter cloacae complex, klebsiella  spp., and, to a somewhat lesser extent, e. coli. in our study, dl was inadequate  for p. aeruginosa, e. faecium, and mrsa. however, it should be noted that for the identification of outbreaks, epidemiological data should be combined with typing  results.

AB  == microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella  species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.

TI  == the clinical and prognostic importance of positive blood cultures in adults.
AB  == background: bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults. bloodstream infections should be reassessed periodically because of increased antibiotic resistance, more patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy, improved antiretroviral therapy, and acquisition of infection in health  care settings other than hospitals. methods: we conducted retrospective assessment by infectious disease physicians of hospitalized adults with positive  blood cultures at 3 academic medical centers. results: two thousand two hundred seventy positive blood culture episodes occurred in 1706 patients. of 2669 isolates, 51% represented true infection, 41% contamination, and 8% unknown clinical significance. although coagulase-negative staphylococci were most common, only 10% were clinically significant. among 1225 true bloodstream infections, the most frequent isolates were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. intravenous catheters were the most common primary source of bloodstream infection (23% of episodes). most (81%) bloodstream infections were acquired in the hospital or other health care settings. crude and attributable in-hospital case-fatality ratios were 20% and 12%, respectively, lower than in previous studies. increasing age, hypotension, absence of fever, hospital acquisition, extreme white blood cell count values, and the presence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancy, or renal disease were significantly associated with an increased risk of in-hospital attributable death in multivariable analysis. conclusions: the proportion of bloodstream infections  due to intravenous catheters is continuing to increase. most episodes were acquired in the hospital or other health care setting. in-hospital case-fatality  ratios have decreased compared with previous studies. several previously identified factors associated with an increased mortality remain statistically significant.

TI  == seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd  in southern brazil.
AB  == the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter  contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus  mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated  that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == influence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance on adult in-hospital mortality from post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background/purpose: to investigate the clinical features, etiology and predictors of in-hospital mortality in adults with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.  methods: this retrospective analysis included 60 adult patients with culture-proven post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis hospitalized between september 2006 and august 2008. results: of the 60 patients, 88.3% had monomicrobial infection and 11.7% had mixed infection. the mean duration from the first neurosurgical procedure to the diagnosis of meningitis was 21 days (range,  1-134 days). the median frequency of neurosurgical procedure before meningitis was 1 (range, 1-5). a total of 69 isolates were identified from the cerebrospinal fluid, the most common pathogens were gram-negative bacilli (43, 62.3%), followed by gram-positive bacteria (24, 34.8%). the three most common gram-negative bacilli were serratia marcescens (7, 10.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.7%), and enterobacter cloacae (4, 5.8%). pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii isolates comprised less than 3%. notably, glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli other than acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp. accounted for 11.6% of the total. of the gram-negative bacilli, resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, were 58.1% and 34.9%, respectively. the two most common gram-positive pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (10, 14.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (including s. epidermidis) (10, 14.5%). the in-hospital mortality rate was 15.0%, which was  significantly related to gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 33.65; p = 0.047). conclusion: these findings may portend the spread of serious resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in nosocomial gram-negative bacilli throughout the neurosurgical units, suggestive of the need to reassess the empirical use of  third-generation cephalosporins in post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.

TI  == the association between antibiotic use and resistance: the role of secondary antibiotics.
AB  == using susceptibility rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae over time as markers, we assessed the significance of the change of susceptibility rates to imipenem, ceftriaxone,  cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin over time and the relationship to antibiotic use for the period 2000-2006. antibiotic use-susceptibility relationships were assessed using longitudinal regression analysis. the variables "time" and define daily doses (ddd)/1,000 patient days for the specific drug related to the susceptibility rates of that particular model's dependent variable were considered as the main effects, with significance determined at the 0.05 level. decreases in susceptibility of the target organisms were common over the period of observation. decreasing susceptibility trends over time were not statistically associated with the primary drug (e.g., organism susceptibility rate to imipenem with imipenem usage). however, secondary drug use was associated with susceptibility rates (e.g., susceptibility of e. cloacae to cefepime with piperacillin/tazobactam usage). these results suggest that antibiotic use-resistance relationships are influenced by the use of secondary antibiotics. thus, a resistance problem may not be adequately addressed by simply altering the utilization of the primary antibiotic.

AB  == background: we report in vitro studies of a commercially available novel antimicrobial luer-activated connector with the inner surface coated with nanoparticle-silver to prevent contaminants from forming biofilm and causing catheter-related bloodstream infection. methods: sterile control nonmedicated connectors and antimicrobial connectors were filled with approximately 1 x 10(5)  cfu/ml of staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans; after 24 h of incubation, the numbers of remaining viable microorganisms were quantified and compared with the concentration in control connectors ( approximately 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml). in trials  simulating clinical use, septal membranes of connectors were inoculated with e. cloacae, were allowed to dry, and were then actuated and infused with lactated ringer's solution for 72 h, with sampling for microorganisms in downstream efferent fluid and for biofilm in the connector. results: microorganisms suspended in the intraluminal fluid path of antimicrobial connectors were rapidly killed. for 5 species, there was a 5.23-6.80 mean log(10) reduction (>99.999%), and with c. albicans, there was a 99.9% reduction. in clinical simulation trials, heavy contamination of downstream fluid was detected at all time points with control connectors, reaching approximately 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml at 72 h, and heavy biofilm was uniformly present; with the antimicrobial connectors, there was complete prevention of downstream fluid contamination and total absence of biofilm formation. conclusions: these simulation experiments show that needleless connectors readily acquire an internal biofilm when microorganisms gain access to the internal fluid path and that biofilm formation allows an exponential buildup  of internal contamination, with shedding back into the fluid path and downstream  sufficient to cause bacteremia. incorporation of nanoparticle silver into the lining surfaces of the novel connector kills microorganisms in the fluid pathway  and prevents internal biofilm formation, even with high levels of introduced contamination and continuous fluid flow. this technology deserves to be evaluated in a prospective, randomized clinical trial to determine its capacity to prevent  catheter-associated bloodstream infection.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection in gram-negative bacilli of nosocomial origin.
AB  == background: resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. the presence of esbl producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. materials and methods: in the period from june 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection.  the isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for esbl by double disc synergy test (ddst- a screening test)and then phenotypic  confirmatory test. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified kirby bauer disc diffusion method. results: from the sample of 238 gram-negative  bacilli, we isolated escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii and enterobacter cloacae. following both methods, 34% isolates were esbl-positive. the esbl producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-esbl producers. multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in esbl positive isolates than non-esbl isolates (21.66%). conclusion: high prevalence of esbl in our hospital cannot be ignored. esbl producers can be detected by ddst and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. the sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of  one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. we recommend ddst using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (hap). the trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in hap, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of mics </=2 microg/ml for the entire collection). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, and enterobacter cloacae. as reported previously, a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and the proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. the excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.

TI  == colistin administration to pediatric and neonatal patients.
AB  == emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative nosocomial pathogens has led to resurgence of colistin use. safety and efficacy data regarding colistin use in pediatric patients are sparse, while optimal dosage has not been defined. we present a case series of neonates and children without cystic fibrosis treated with various doses of colistin intravenously. the records of patients who received colistin in a tertiary-care hospital from january 2007 to march 2009 were reviewed. thirteen patients (median age 5 years, range 22 days to 14 years)  received 19 courses of colistin as treatment of pneumonia, central nervous system infection, bacteremia, or complicated soft tissue infection. the isolated pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. daily dose  of colistin (colistimethate) ranged between 40,000 and 225,000 iu/kg. duration of administration ranged from 1 to 133 days. other antimicrobials were co-administered in 18/19 courses. increase of serum creatinine in one patient was associated with co-administration of colistin and gentamicin. sixteen of 19 courses had a favorable outcome, and only two of the three deaths were infection-related. colistin intravenous administration appears well tolerated even at higher than previously recommended doses and of prolonged duration.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == resistance development profiling of piperacillin in combination with the novel {beta}-lactamase inhibitor bli-489.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate development of resistance to the piperacillin/bli-489 combination. methods: bli-489 was used at a constant concentration of 4 mg/l. spontaneous mutation frequency was measured on piperacillin/bli-489-containing agar plates. five beta-lactamase-producing strains were exposed to a serial dilution of piperacillin/bli-489, and the highest concentration allowing growth was used to inoculate subsequent serial passage for 10 days. mutation stability was monitored in drug-free medium for 10 days. results: escherichia coli (oxa-3,  oxa-7, act-1, shv-1 or none), salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (ctx-m-5),  klebsiella pneumoniae (shv-1 and shv-5) and enterobacter cloacae (ampc) had a spontaneous mutation frequency of < or =1.0 x 10(-9). two ampc-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains had a mutation frequency of 6.52 x 10(-6) and 1.0  x 10(-7); a beta-lactamase-negative p. aeruginosa strain had a mutation frequency of 2.68 x 10(-8). the mutant prevention concentration (mpc) was < or =32 mg/l. during serial passages, the mic increased 64- and 128-fold for s. enterica serovar typhimurium (ctx-m-5) and e. cloacae (ampc), respectively, to > or =512 mg/l. the mic reverted to < or =64 mg/l after serial passages in drug-free medium. the mics increased only 4-fold for k. pneumoniae (shv-1 and shv-5), e. coli (oxa-3) and e. coli (shv-1). conclusions: piperacillin/bli-489 demonstrated  a low probability of spontaneous resistance development in vitro for all of the strains tested with the exception of p. aeruginosa. the mpc value for all strains was < or =32 mg/l. resistance developed during serial passage for two of the five strains tested; however, this resistance phenotype was unstable as mic values reverted to < or =64 mg/l after propagation in drug-free medium.

TI  == colistin therapy for microbiologically documented multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections: a retrospective cohort study of 258 patients.
AB  == it is unclear whether the effectiveness of polymyxins depends on the site of infection, the responsible pathogen, dosage, and monotherapy vs. combination therapy. we investigated colistin therapy in a large, retrospective, single-centre, cohort study. primary analysis outcomes were infection outcome, survival and nephrotoxicity. over a 7-year period (october 2000 to october 2007), 258 patients received intravenous (i.v.) colistin for at least 72h for microbiologically documented multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections, comprising 170 (65.9%) acinetobacter baumannii, 68 (26.4%) pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 (7.0%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 (0.4%) stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 1 (0.4%) enterobacter cloacae. cure of infection occurred in 79.1% of patients, nephrotoxicity in 10% and hospital survival in 65.1%. in the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival were colistin average daily dose [adjusted odds ratio (aor)=1.22, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.05-1.42] and cure of infection (aor=9, 95% ci 3.6-23.1), whilst the proportion of creatinine change (aor=0.21, 95% ci 0.1-0.45), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii score (aor=0.89, 95% ci 0.84-0.95) and  haematological disease (aor=0.23, 95% ci 0.08-0.66) were associated with mortality. effectiveness of colistin was not dependent on the type of pathogen. no independent predictors for nephrotoxicity were observed. the findings of the largest cohort study to date on i.v. colistin show that colistin is a valuable antibiotic with acceptable nephrotoxicity and considerable effectiveness that depends on the daily dosage and infection site.

TI  == dispersal of carbapenemase blavim-1 gene associated with different tn402 variants, mercury transposons, and conjugative plasmids in enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the emergence of bla(vim-1) within four different genetic platforms from distinct enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in an area with a low prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamase producers is reported. forty-three vim-1-producing isolates (including 19 enterobacter cloacae, 2 escherichia coli,  and 2 p. aeruginosa isolates, 18 klebsiella pneumoniae isolate, and 2 klebsiella  oxytoca isolate) recovered from 2005 to 2007 and corresponding to 15 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types were studied. the enterobacteriaceae isolates corresponded to a hospital outbreak, and the p. aeruginosa isolates were sporadically recovered. the genetic context of the integrons carrying bla(vim-1)  (arbitrarily designated types a, b, c, and d) was characterized by pcr mapping based on known tn402 and mercury transposons and further sequencing. among enterobacteriaceae isolates, bla(vim-1) was part of integrons located either in an in2-tn402 element linked to tn21 (type a; in110-bla(vim-1)-aaca4-aada1) or in  a tn402 transposon lacking the whole tni module [type b; in113-bla(vim-1)-aaca4-dhfrii (also called dfrb1)-aada1-catb2] and the transposon was associated with an inchi2 or inci1 plasmid, respectively. among p. aeruginosa isolates, bla(vim-1) was part of a new gene cassette array located in a defective tn402 transposon carrying either tnibdelta3 and tnia (type c; bla(vim-1)-aada1) or tnic and deltatniq (type d; bla(vim-1)-aadb), and both tn402 variants were associated with conjugative plasmids of 30 kb. the dissemination of bla(vim-1) was associated with different genetic structures and bacterial hosts, depicting a complex emergence and evolutionary network scenario in our facility, ramon y cajal university hospital, madrid, spain. knowledge of the complex epidemiology of bla(vim-1) is necessary to control this emerging threat.

TI  == in vitro activities of antimicrobials against six important species of gram-negative bacteria isolated from raw milk samples in korea.
AB  == gram-negative bacteria (gnb) with multidrug resistance pose a serious threat to public health. they are environmental pathogens frequently isolated from raw milk and mastitis in dairy cattle. this study was to examine the in vitro antimicrobial activities against 225 isolates belonging to six important species  of gnb from mastitic raw milk samples of dairy herds in the republic of korea: acinetobacter baumannii (n = 17), citrobacter freundii (n = 19), enterobacter cloacae (n = 54), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 55), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 45), and serratia marcescens (n = 35). in general, amikacin, gentamicin, and piperacillin exhibited strong antimicrobial activities against all bacterial species tested, whereas rifampin, cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin were ineffective against most of the bacterial species tested. wide differences were observed in the patterns of resistance among the bacterial species; in particular, resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol was highly variable among the strains belonging to different bacterial species. almost half of the gnb isolates (45.3%, 102/225) were resistant to 5 or more of 12 antimicrobial agents tested: p. aeruginosa (86.6%, 39/45) showed the highest resistance rate, followed by s. marcescens (65.7%, 23/35). this study indicates that multiple antimicrobial resistances are prevalent among gnb isolates from mastitic milk samples of dairy cattle in the republic of korea.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == intraspecific variation and interspecific differences in the bacterial and fungal assemblages of blue tit (cyanistes caeruleus) and great tit (parus major) nests.
AB  == although interest in the relationship between birds and microorganisms is increasing, few studies have compared nest microbial assemblages in wild passerines to determine variation within and between species. culturing microorganisms from blue tit (cyanistes caeruleus) and great tit (parus major) nests from the same study site demonstrated diverse microbial communities with 32 bacterial and 13 fungal species being isolated. dominant bacteria were pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and staphylococcus hyicus. also common in the nests were the keratinolytic bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri and bacillus subtilis. dominant fungi were cladosporium herbarum and epicoccum purpurascens. aspergillus flavous, microsporum gallinae, and candida albicans (causative agents of avian aspergillosis, favus, and candidiasis, respectively) were present in 30%, 25%, and 10% of nests, respectively. although there were no  differences in nest mass or materials, bacterial (but not fungal) loads were significantly higher in blue tit nests. microbial species also differed interspecifically. as regards potential pathogens, the prevalence of enterobacter cloacae was higher in blue tit nests, while pseudomonas aeruginosa-present in 30% of blue tit nests-was absent from great tit nests. the allergenic fungus cladosporium cladosporioides was both more prevalent and abundant in great tit nests. using discriminant function analysis (dfa), nests were classified to avian species with 100% accuracy using the complete microbial community. partial dfa models were created using a reduced number of variables and compared using akaike's information criterion on the basis of model fit and parsimony. the best  models classified unknown nests with 72.5-95% accuracy using a small subset of microbes (n = 1-8), which always included pseudomonas agarici. this suggests that despite substantial intraspecific variation in nest microflora, there are significant interspecific differences-both in terms of individual microbes and the overall microbial community-even when host species are closely related, ecologically similar, sympatric, and construct very similar nests.

AB  == staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and more bacteria have  shown resistance to antibiotics in colombia, therefore, resistance to antibiotics is a problem that is on increase in colombia. the resistance mechanism to penicillin antibiotics in these bacteria is the expression of beta-lactamase enzyme. in order to use the penicillin antibiotics which are still effective against them, we had evaluated 10 chalcones as inhibitors of this enzyme. the most active chalcone showed k(m') = 406.7 microm higher than clavulanic acid that showed k(m') = 211.9 microm at 37 degrees c during 10 h, and using amoxycillin as substrate. the chalcones were better competitive inhibitors because of they allowed the hydrolysis of smaller quantity of amoxycillin than the clavulanic acid, the most active chalcone showed k(cat)/k(m) = 1.398 (minm)(-1) and the clavulanic acid showed k(cat)/k(m) = 2.674 (minm)(-1). the molecular modelling of the enzyme-chalcones complexes showed that the chalcones with electron-donating groups on ortho, meta position of a ring favour the interaction with the residues threonine-319, lysine-67, serine-64 and tyrosine-150 of the active site of the enzyme, because of the number and strong of hydrogen bonds of the chalcones in the active site of the enzyme increase, and therefore the affinity of the chalcones increases too. the electron-donating groups in the chalcones contribute to their inductive effect improving the interaction with the active site of the enzyme because of rising of electrostatic attraction between them.

AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == chemical compositions and antibacterial activities of the essential oils from aerial parts and corollas of origanum acutidens (hand.-mazz.) ietswaart, an endemic species to turkey.
AB  == essential oils extracted by hydrodistillation from the aerial parts and corollas  of origanum acutidens (hand.-mazz.) ietswaart, an endemic turkish flora species,  were analyzed by gc-ms. the amounts of essential oil obtained from the aerial parts and the corollas were 0.73% and 0.93%, respectively. twenty-five components in both the aerial parts oil and the corolla oil, representing 95.11% and 93.88%, respectively, were identified. the aerial parts and corolla oils were characterized by the predominance of two components: p-cymene (9.43% and 17.51%)  and carvacrol (67.51% and 52.33%), respectively. the essential oils were also evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against ten bacteria by the disc diffusion assay. our findings showed the following order in the sensitivity to the essential oils, as indicated by the corresponding inhibition zones: proteus vulgaris > salmonella typhimurium > enterobacter cloacae > klebsiella pneumonia > escherichia coli > serratia marcescens > pseudomonas aeruginosa for the aerial parts essential oil, and salmonella typhimurium > proteus vulgaris > enterobacter cloacae > escherichia coli > klebsiella pneumoniae > serratia marcescens > pseudomonas aeruginosa for the corolla essential oil. the studied essential oils  thus exhibited a broad-spectrum of activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, whereas the tested gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to the essential oil samples.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the argentine puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  == aim: the plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "puna" or "altiplano" of argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. materials and methods: the antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (baccharis boliviensis, chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, chuquiraga atacamensis, fabiana bryoides, fabiana densa, fabiana punensis, frankenia triandra, parastrephia lucida, parastrephia lepidophylla, parastrephia phyliciformis, tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi, formerly nccls). the antibiotic resistant clinical strains were  isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. results: the ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa. ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of baccharis, fabiana and parastrephia showed the highest levels of  antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant staphylococcus with mic values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. baccharis boliviensis and fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. the most interesting activity on  multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from chuquiraga atacamensis. parastrephia species showed activity against enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. the extracts were  bactericidal in most cases. conclusions: the presence of antibacterial activity in puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans  and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis between 2003 and 2008 in korea.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess trends in the prevalence and distribution of gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis and their antimicrobial susceptibilities during a 6-yr period between 2003 and 2008 in korea. escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter lwoffi/junii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens were the most commonly observed pathogens during this period. generally, gram-negative bacteria showed low susceptibilities to most of the antimicrobials tested in this study, except amikacin and gentamicin. although these 2 aminoglycosides were broadly active against gram-negative bacteria, less  than half of those bacteria showed susceptibilities to streptomycin. the beta-lactams, except piperacillin, had the lowest activity among antimicrobials tested in this study. susceptibilities to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim were fairy high in all genera of gram-negative bacteria, except acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas spp., whereas relatively high resistance to tetracycline was observed uniformly among gram-negative bacteria. there was no significant change in the prevalence of bacterial and the proportion of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacteria isolates during a 6-yr period.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline alone and in combination against clinical isolates of resistant gram-negative pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == ceftaroline is a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin that exhibits bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and -negative pathogens. however, the activity of ceftaroline cannot be solely relied upon for eradication of multidrug-resistant gram-negative isolates, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae, which represent a current clinical concern. as drug combinations might be beneficial by potential synergy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline combined with meropenem, aztreonam, cefepime, tazobactam, amikacin, levofloxacin, and tigecycline. susceptibility testing was performed for 20 clinical p. aeruginosa isolates, 10 esbl-producing escherichia coli isolates, 10 esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, and 10 ampc-derepressed enterobacter cloacae isolates. time-kill experiments were performed for 10 isolates using antimicrobials at one-fourth the mic. ceftaroline exhibited a mic range of 0.125  to 1,024 microg/ml and was reduced 2- to 512-fold by combination with tazobactam  (4 microg/ml) for esbl-producing strains. in time-kill experiments, ceftaroline plus amikacin was synergistic against 90% of the isolates (and indifferent for one p. aeruginosa isolate). ceftaroline plus tazobactam was indifferent for e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa strains but synergistic against 100% of e. coli and k.  pneumoniae isolates. combinations of ceftaroline plus meropenem or aztreonam were also synergistic for all e. coli and e. cloacae isolates, respectively, but indifferent against 90% of the other isolates. finally, combinations of ceftaroline plus either tigecycline, levofloxacin, or cefepime were indifferent for 100% of the isolates. no antagonism was observed with any combination. ceftaroline plus amikacin appeared as the most likely synergistic combination. this represents a promising therapeutic option, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical value of ceftaroline combinations against resistant gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == integron mobilization unit as a source of mobility of antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  == antibiotic resistance genes are spread mostly through plasmids, integrons (as a form of gene cassettes), and transposons in gram-negative bacteria. we describe here a novel genetic structure, named the integron mobilization unit (imu), that  has characteristics similar to those of miniature inverted transposable elements  (mites). two imus (288 bp each) were identified from a carbapenem-resistant enterobacter cloacae isolate that formed a composite structure encompassing a defective class 1 integron containing the carbapenem resistance gene bla(ges-5).  this beta-lactamase gene was located on a 7-kb incq-type plasmid named pche-a, which was sequenced completely. the plasmid pche-a was not self conjugative but was mobilizable, and it was successfully transferred from e. cloacae to pseudomonas aeruginosa. the in silico analysis of the extremities of the imu elements identified similarities with those of insertion sequence issod9 from shewanella oneidensis mr-1. the mobilization of the imu composite structure was accomplished by using the transposase activity of issod9 that was provided in trans. this is the first identification of mite-type structures as a source of gene mobilization, implicating here a clinically relevant antibiotic resistance gene.

TI  == effects of an alternative cefepime dosing strategy in pulmonary and bloodstream infections caused by enterobacter spp, citrobacter freundii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa: a single-center, open-label, prospective, observational study.
AB  == background: various dosing strategies for cefepime have been developed in an effort to maximize pharmacodynamic exposure of this agent against gram-negative infections. an assessment of cefepime dosing strategies is warranted given recent reports of poorer treatment outcomes associated with cefepime compared with other antibiotics, particularly in patients infected with gram-negative organisms with  elevated mics. objectives: the aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of cefepime iv at a dose of 1 g q8h (adjusted based on renal function) with those of other appropriate antimicrobials in the treatment of gramnegative pulmonary and bloodstream infections and to identify risk factors for treatment failure. methods: this single-center, open-label, prospective, observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center (barnes-jewish hospital, st. louis, missouri). isolates from infections in adult patients with bacteremia or pulmonary infection caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, or citrobacter freundii were assessed in a noninterventional manner. infections were identified using an electronic notification system. patients receiving appropriate monotherapy against the studied isolate within 24 hours of culture attainment were stratified into 1 of 3 cohorts according to treatment outcome, as follows: treatment success (resolution of initial fever or elevated white blood cell count to normal values plus the presence of repeat negative cultures from the initial site or below the quantitative definition for infection), improvement (treatment success without repeat negative cultures), or treatment failure (persistent or repeat positive cultures for the original organism at the infected site despite appropriate and adequate antimicrobial therapy, lack of resolution in fever or leukocytosis, switch to an alternative antibiotic, or the addition of another antibiotic with gram-negative coverage after > or =3 days of the initial regimen, relapse of infection within 14 days, or mortality attributable to the index infection). multivariate regression analysis was used to examine risk factors associated with treatment failure. results: data from 120 patients (56.7% male; mean age, 62.2 years) were analyzed. treatment failure occurred in 48.6% (36/74) of patients who received cefepime versus 32.6% (15/46) of those who received other antibiotics; this difference was not statistically significant. the proportion of patients with markers of increased severity of illness (intensive care unit [p = 0.005] and mechanical ventilation [p = 0.002]) was significantly greater in the cefepime group compared with the group that received other antibiotics. multivariate logistic regression identified infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 1.40 [95% ci, 1.01-2.00]) and mechanical ventilation (aor, 7.08 [95% ci, 1.80-31.3]) as being associated with treatment failure in patients who received cefepime. mechanical ventilation (aor, 3.97 [95% ci, 1.47-11.1]) and neutropenia (aor, 5.26 [95% ci, 1.28-20.0]) were independent predictors of treatment failure among all patients studied. conclusions: based on these results in this small cohort, the efficacy of this cefepime dosing strategy (1 g q8h) appeared to be similar to that of other antimicrobials.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == [the vicissitude of pathogenic bacteria isolated from critically ill patients in  an intensive care unit during a period of using antibiotics].
AB  == objective: to observe the changing spectrum of the pathogenic bacteria during seven-day antibiotics targeted therapy in an intensive care unit (icu). methods:  in a group of 100 patients of hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) with identified pathogenic bacteria undergoing antibiotic treatment according to susceptibility test, the changes in the species of the pathogens and their ratio in their sputum specimens were studied, and the relationship were analyzed the characteristic between the changes and the age, the time of medication and the length of stay. results: among all the bacterial isolates (n=295) in icu, the percentage of gram-negative bacillus was 62.4% (184/295). the prevalent causative microorganisms isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa 22.4% (66/295), mrsa/mrse 20.7% (61/295) and acinetobacter spp. 10.5% (31/295). when one or more than one potent antibiotic in accord with the result of sensitivity test, change in ratio  of pathogens occurred in 160, and change in species in 126. when the use of antibiotics was prolonged, the change in the former became less often. the change in ratio was less in 3-5 days than that of 6-7 days, the ratio was 72.7%, 62.5%,  60.0% (p<0.01) respectively on the 3rd day, the 4th day and the 5th day, showing  that susceptible pathogenic bacteria became less gradually, indicating that the treatment was effective . however, the change in species of pathogenic bacteria began more obvious, and it was more predominant on the 6th day and the 7th day, which was 66.0%, 77.1% (p<0.01) respectively, showing emergence of new non-susceptible pathogenic bacteria. with increase in the use of different antibiotics, the species of pathogenic bacteria showed to increase an increasing  tendency of change. when gram-negative bacillus infection was treated, antibiotic resistant bacteria such as candida albicans and mrsa usually appeared. but when gram-positive bacillus infections were treated, candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae readily appeared. there was relationship between the change in pathogenic bacteria and age, and the length of stay of the  patients. the more older in age and the longer the length of stay, the change in  pathogenic bacteria was more predominant. conclusion: new antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria appears after seven-day antibiotic-targeted therapy in icu. the change of species of pathogenic bacteria is related to the duration and type  of using antibiotic, and also the age and length of stay. the longer time of use  and the more different types of antibiotic used, the older in age and the longer  in length of stay, the change in species of pathogenic bacteria is more predominant. monitoring the dynamic change of pathogenic bacteria, adjusting the  antibiotic promptly and rational use of antibiotics are very important to decrease the change in species and antibiotic resistance of the bacteria.

TI  == pathogen prevalence and influence of composted dairy manure application on antimicrobial resistance profiles of commensal soil bacteria.
AB  == composting manure, if done properly, should kill pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella and escherichia coli o157:h7, providing for an environmentally safe product. over a 3-year period, samples of composted dairy manure, representing 11 composting operations (two to six samples per producer; 100 total samples), were  screened for salmonella and e. coli o157:h7 and were all culture negative. nonpathogenic bacteria were cultured from these compost samples that could theoretically facilitate the spread of antimicrobial resistance from the dairy to compost application sites. therefore, we collected soil samples (three samples per plot; 10 plots/treatment; 90 total samples) from rangeland that received either composted dairy manure (cp), commercial fertilizer (f), or no treatment (control, con). two collections were made appoximately 2 and 7 months following treatment application. soil samples were cultured for pseudomonas and enterobacter and confirmed isolates subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. three species of enterobacter (cloacae, 27 isolates; aeroginosa, two isolates; sakazakii, one isolate) and two species of pseudomonas (aeruginosa, 11  isolates; putida, seven isolates) were identified. five enterobacter isolates were resistant to ampicillin and one isolate was resistant to spectinomycin. all  pseudomonas isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ceftiofur, florfenicol, sulphachloropyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and  most isolates were resistant to chlortetracycline and spectinomycin. pseudomonas  isolates were resistant to an average of 8.6, 7.9, and 8 antibiotics for con, cp, and f treatments, respectively. no treatment differences were observed in antimicrobial resistance patterns in any of the soil isolates examined. results reported herein support the use of composted dairy manure as an environmentally friendly soil amendment.

TI  == summer peaks in the incidences of gram-negative bacterial infection among hospitalized patients.
AB  == objective: recognition of seasonal trends in hospital infections may improve diagnosis, use of empirical therapy, and infection prevention interventions. there are very few data available regarding the seasonal variability of these infections. we quantified the seasonal variation in the incidences of hospital infection caused by common bacterial pathogens and estimated the association between temperature changes and infection rates. methods: a cohort of all adult patients admitted to the university of maryland medical center during the period  from 1998 through 2005 was analyzed. time-series analyses were used to estimate the association of the number of infections per month caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci with season and temperature, while controlling for long-term trends. results: there were 218,594 admissions to the index hospital, and analysis of 26,624 unique clinical cultures that grew the organisms of interest identified increases in the mean monthly rates of infection caused by p. aeruginosa (28% of isolates recovered; p ! .01), e. cloacae (46%; p  ! .01), e. coli (12%; p ! .01), and a. baumannii (21%; pp.06). for each 10 degrees f increase, we observed a 17% increase in the monthly rates of infection  caused by p. aeruginosa (pp.01) and a. baumanii (pp.05). conclusion: significantly higher rates of gram-negative infection were observed during the summer months, compared with other seasons. for some pathogens, higher temperatures were associated with higher infection rates, independent of seasonality. these findings have important implications for infection prevention, such as enhanced surveillance during the warmer months, and for choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy among hospitalized adults. future, quasi-experimental investigations of gram-negative infection prevention initiatives should control for seasonal variation.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == first countrywide survey of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases in gram-negative pathogens in italy.
AB  == metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) can confer resistance to most beta-lactams, including carbapenems. their emergence in gram-negative pathogens is a matter of  major concern. italy was the first european country to report the presence of acquired mbls in gram-negative pathogens and is one of the countries where mbl producers have been detected repeatedly. here, we present the results of the first italian nationwide survey of acquired mbls in gram-negative pathogens. of 14,812 consecutive nonreplicate clinical isolates (12,245 enterobacteriaceae isolates and 2,567 gram-negative nonfermenters) screened for reduced carbapenem susceptibility during a 4-month period (september to december 2004), 30 isolates  (28 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 pseudomonas putida isolate, and 1 enterobacter cloacae isolate) carried acquired mbl determinants. mbl producers were detected in 10 of 12 cities, with a predominance of vim-type enzymes over imp-type enzymes (4:1). although having an overall low prevalence (1.3%) and significant geographical differences, mbl-producing p. aeruginosa strains appeared to be widespread in italy, with a notable diversity of clones, enzymes,  and integrons carrying mbl gene cassettes.

TI  == sitafloxacin hydrate for bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin hydrate (du-6859a, gracevit), a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral  fluoroquinolone that is very active against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic clinical isolates, including strains resistant to other fluoroquinolones, was recently approved in japan for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections. sitafloxacin is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and other quinolones and enterococci. sitafloxacin has also demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (including about 67% of strains producing extended-spectrum, beta-lactamases and resistant to ciprofloxacin), enterobacter  cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa with some activity against quinolone-resistant strains and acinetobacter baumannii. the in vitro activity against anaerobes is comparable to imipenem or metronidazole. in a published phase ii randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, sitafloxacin (400 mg once daily) was comparable to imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg three times a day). results of the phase iii trials of sitafloxacin are not available in english. the clinical safety profile of sitafloxacin has been characterized from 1,059 patients who participated in 10 clinical trials. the most common events with 50 or 100 mg twice daily were gastrointestinal disorders  (17.2%), mostly diarrhea, and abnormal laboratory test results (16.2%), mostly liver enzyme elevations. for japanese patients, sitafloxacin provides the broad-spectrum coverage promised by clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin and comparable to carbapenems. while it is currently limited by its potential for phototoxicity in caucasians, phototoxicity is essentially irrelevant if sitafloxacin is used in hospitals and especially in intensive care units.

TI  == lipids including cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate contribute to the inherent antibacterial activity of human nasal fluid.
AB  == mucosal surfaces provide first-line defense against microbial invasion through their complex secretions. the antimicrobial activities of proteins in these secretions have been well delineated, but the contributions of lipids to mucosal  defense have not been defined. we found that normal human nasal fluid contains all major lipid classes (in micrograms per milliliter), as well as lipoproteins and apolipoprotein a-i. the predominant less polar lipids were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid, cholesterol, and cholesteryl palmitate, cholesteryl linoleate, and cholesteryl arachidonate. normal human bronchioepithelial cell secretions exhibited a similar lipid composition. removal of less-polar lipids significantly decreased the inherent antibacterial activity of nasal fluid against pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was in part restored after replenishing the lipids. furthermore, lipids extracted from nasal fluid exerted direct antibacterial activity in synergism with the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptide hnp-2 and liposomal formulations of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate were active against p. aeruginosa at physiological concentrations as found in nasal fluid and exerted inhibitory activity against other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. these data suggest that host-derived lipids contribute to mucosal defense. the emerging concept of host-derived antimicrobial lipids unveils novel roads to a better understanding of the immunology of infectious diseases.

TI  == [infectious complications of surgically treatment pelvic fractures].
AB  == based on case histories, the authors draw attention to important infectious complications in patients surgically treated for pelvic injuries. these complications were recorded in four out of 75 patients (5.3%) undergoing surgery  for pelvic fracture in the period from 2001 to 2005. the chief risk factors for the development of infection included the poor state of health of a polytraumatized patient in combination with a long stay in an acute care unit, and severe trauma and bleeding of soft tissue structures in b and c types of pelvic injury. bacteriological findings showed the presence of several pathogenic species (enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca) or multi-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus).

AB  == this study aimed to assess the peritoneal pharmacodynamics of intravenous doripenem using population pharmacokinetic modeling and monte carlo simulation. drug concentrations in peritoneal fluid (pf) and serum from 11 laparotomy patients and mic distributions against clinical isolates in japan for 4 gram-negative organisms were used. the probabilities of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (40% t > mic) were greater in pf than in serum. to achieve a > or =90% probability of target attainment in pf, 0.25 g tid and 0.5 g tid (0.5-h infusions) had to be sufficient against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter cloacae; however, 1 g tid (0.5-h infusion) was required against  pseudomonas aeruginosa. prolonged (4-h) infusion regimens resulted in increase of the target attainment probabilities in pf for p. aeruginosa. these results should help to achieve a better understanding of the peritoneal pharmacodynamics of doripenem while also helping to rationalize and optimize the dosing regimen for intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == peritoneal pharmacokinetics of cefepime in laparotomy patients with inflammatory  bowel disease, and dosage considerations for surgical intra-abdominal infections  based on pharmacodynamic assessment.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the peritoneal pharmacokinetics of cefepime and to assess its pharmacodynamic exposure in peritoneal fluid (pf). cefepime (1 g) was  administered to eight patients with inflammatory bowel disease before abdominal surgery. venous blood and pf samples were obtained at the end of the 0.5-h infusion and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h thereafter. drug concentrations in plasma  and pf were determined, analyzed pharmacokinetically, and used for a monte carlo  simulation with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) data. cefepime penetrated  well into pf, with a maximum drug concentration in a pf/plasma ratio of 0.59 +/-  0.15 (mean +/- sd, n = 8), and an area under the concentration-time curve ratio of 0.90 +/- 0.10. the probabilities of attaining the bacteriostatic and bactericidal targets (40% and 70% of the time above the mic, respectively) in pf  were > or =85% against escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and enterobacter cloacae with 0.5 g every 12 h, 1 g every 12 h, 1 g every 8 h, and 2 g every 12 h. however, 1 g every 8 h or 2 g every 12 h was required for bacteriostatic and bactericidal probabilities > or =85% against pseudomonas aeruginosa. these conventional regimens did not achieve a high probability against bacteroides species. these results should help to give us a better understanding of the peritoneal pharmacokinetics of cefepime while also helping to choose the appropriate dosage to prevent surgical intra-abdominal infections on the basis of the pharmacodynamic assessment.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == influence of extended-spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance.
AB  == purpose: the influence of extended- spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance was studied. methods: hospital pharmacists were asked to provide data on antimicrobial use and bacterial susceptibilities. defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam were assessed for significant associations with gram-negative susceptibility. to account for midyear changes in usage patterns and the lag between changes in usage and resistance, susceptibility over two-year periods was evaluated. results: susceptibility data of more than 300,000 gram-negative isolates, representing 10 species of interest, were provided by 82  u.s. hospitals. two-year periods (n = 45) were evaluable for 25 hospitals, containing 159 hospital-years of data and 204,513 clinical isolates. use of cefepime increased, while use of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased. excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria were most susceptible to cefepime, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime. significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics themselves were observed with ceftazidime (enterobacter aerogenes) and ceftriaxone (escherichia coli). extended-spectrum beta-lactams associated with significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to other beta-lactams included cefepime (e. aerogenes and e. coli susceptibility to ceftazidime), ceftazidime (enterobacter cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), ceftriaxone (e. cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), piperacillin-tazobactam (e. cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa susceptibility to cefepime). there were insufficient susceptibility data to allow for impact analysis for piperacillin-tazobactam. conclusion: use of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with variably changing susceptibilities of several key gram-negative bacteria, either to themselves or to each other. despite the increased use of cefepime, gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cefepime remained high.

TI  == medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial  activity. however, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. methods: we assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of revamil (bfactory), a  medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. results: with bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. after 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy  volunteers was reduced 100-fold (p < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (p < .001). conclusions: revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including  those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == prevalence of silver resistance in bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcers and efficacy of silver-containing wound dressings.
AB  == silver dressings are used to manage wounds at risk of infection or locally infected. this in vitro study was conducted to assess the prevalence of silver resistance genes in 112 bacterial isolates obtained from the diabetic foot ulcers of patients attending the diabetic foot clinic at tameside general hospital, uk.  using polymerase chain reaction to screen for three silver-resistance transcriptional units--sile, sils and silp--two silver-resistant bacteria were identified; both are strains of enterobacter cloacae, an organism rarely implicated as a primary pathogen in chronic wounds. no recognized wound pathogens (staphylococcus aureus-24 isolates and pseudomonas aeruginosa-nine isolates) were found to contain silver-resistant genes. analysis of the efficacy of silver-containing dressings on the silver-resistant strains of enterobacter cloacae using confocal laser microscopy showed that, despite evidence of genetic  resistance to silver, all strains were killed following a maximum of 48 hours of  exposure to the dressings. results suggest that presence of silver resistance genes is rare and that genetic resistance does not necessarily translate to phenotypic resistance to silver. while silver resistance in wound care should be  monitored, the threat of widespread resistance is low and silver-containing dressings remain an extremely important tool in managing wound infection.

AB  == we report the case of a 17-year-old boy who was hit by a high velocity train. the polytraumatized patient suffered a 3 degrees open femur defect fracture with a substantial loss of the lateral femoral muscles and significant disruption of the soft tissue of the lower leg. the enormous wound areas on the thigh and the lower leg were infected by pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the enormous tissue defects and the superinfection  did not leave any hope for saving the limb from amputation. after rapid aggressive debridement and pulsatile lavage, we covered the wounds as a last resort with a new technique of vacuum-assisted closure (v.a.c) and instillation (v.a.c. instill(r)) dressings. in sequences of 1 min we instilled lavasept, kept  it for 20 min on the wound surface, and exhausted the liquid. we repeated this for 6 consecutive days and then changed the dressing. in the follow-up examinations the number of germs was significantly reduced. during follow-up care we used the v.a.c. treatment without instillation and finally we transplanted skin onto the clean wound surface and were able to save the leg of this young patient. we discharged him with a good function of his lower leg. this technique  of v.a.c. instill seems to offer great possibilities in critically infected wound situations.

TI  == assessing the effect of an antimicrobial wound dressing on biofilms.
AB  == to date the effect of silver-containing wound dressings on biofilms, known to be  present in chronic wounds, has not been determined or documented. in this current study, we aimed to determine the antimicrobial effect of a silver-containing dressing on biofilms grown in a chambered slide model. before the addition of a wound dressing onto a 24-hour biofilm, composed of either pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, or a mixed bacterial community, a fluorescent dye was applied. this enabled the viability of sessile bacteria to be monitored in real-time, using a rapid form of confocal laser scanning microscopy  over a contact time period of 48 hours. by analyzing all the three-dimensional data generated from the confocal time-lapse sequences, 90% of all sessile bacteria within the biofilm were observed to progressively turn red (i.e., died)  within 24 hours. total bacterial kill in the biofilm was achieved after 48 hours. this research has shown that the dressing was effective in killing the tested bacteria evident in both the tested mono and polymicrobial biofilms, which provides valuable evidence that this dressing may have an effect on biofilms found in recalcitrant chronic wounds.

TI  == in vitro activity of isepamicin and other aminoglycosides against clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections.
AB  == background and purpose: isepamicin is a newly introduced aminoglycoside in taiwan. since in vitro data for isepamicin against nosocomial gram-negative bloodstream infection from taiwan are limited, we compared the activity of isepamicin, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin against nosocomial gram-negative  blood isolates. methods: a total of 247 non-duplicate nosocomial blood isolates of gram-negative bacteria collected between january 2003 and december 2003 in a major teaching hospital in taiwan were tested for their in vitro susceptibilities to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and isepamicin using the agar dilution method. the isolates included escherichia coli (31 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (31), enterobacter cloacae (30), serratia marcescens (31), morganella  morganii (21), citrobacter freundii (10), pseudomonas aeruginosa (31), acinetobacter baumannii (31), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31). results: overall, isepamicin had high antibacterial activity against the tested gram-negative bacteria. for the 154 enterobacteriaceae isolates, isepamicin had the lowest minimum concentration inhibiting 90% of isolates (mic90) among the tested drugs, while its resistance rate (3.9%) was equal to that of amikacin (3.9%) and lower than those of tobramycin (18.2%) and gentamicin (21.4%). for the 93 of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli isolates, isepamicin had the lowest  mic90, and a resistance rate (23.7%) lower than those of amikacin (27.9%), tobramycin (38.7%) and gentamicin (40.9%). conclusions: the in vitro activity of  isepamicin against gram-negative bacteria isolates was equal or similar to amikacin and superior to other tested aminoglycosides. in view of its potential for less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity than other aminoglycosides, isepamicin is a drug of choice for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activities of 'new' and 'conventional' antibiotics against multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria from patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == objectives: to identify and collect clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria and to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing using  an extended panel of antibiotics including tigecycline, colistin, aztreonam, piperacillin/tazobactam and ampicillin/sulbactam. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) using the epsilometer test (e-test) methodology were determined for 28 distinct multi-drug resistant gram negative isolates from patients in the intensive care unit (icu). results: tigecycline had good in vitro activity against acinetobacter species and enterobacter cloacae, and colistin had potent in vitro activity against acinetobacter, e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens but not p. aeruginosa or acinetobacter species were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam. ampicillin/sulbactam had poor in vitro activity for most isolates tested. the activity of tigecycline and colistin did not appear to be affected by the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) and aztreonam maintained its in vitro activity against the enterobacteriaceae tested despite the presence of mbls. conclusions: tigecycline  and colistin have potent in vitro activity and might have useful therapeutic activity in patients with infections due to multi-drug resistant acinetobacter species and e. cloacae, including those harbouring esbls and mbls. in addition, colistin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against multi-drug resistant p. aeruginosa.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

TI  == carbapenemases: molecular diversity and clinical consequences.
AB  == carbapenemases are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze most beta-lactams including carbapenems. carbapenemases are classified in four molecular classes; those belonging to class a are the chromosomally-encoded and clavulanic acid-inhibited  imi, nmc-a and sme, identified in enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens; the plasmid-encoded kpc enzymes identified in enterobacteriaceae (and rarely in pseudomonas aeruginosa); and the ges-type enzymes identified in enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. the class b enzymes are the most clinically-significant carbapenemases; they are metallo-beta-lactamases, mostly of the imp and the vim series. they have been reported worldwide and their genes  are plasmid- and integron-located, hydrolyzing all beta-lactams with the exception of aztreonam. one single plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase, cmy-10,  identified in an enterobacter aerogenes isolate, has been shown to be a cephaslosporinase with some carbapenemase properties. finally, the class d carbapenemases are being increasingly reported, mostly in acinetobacter baumannii, and they compromise the efficacy of imipenem and meropenem significantly.

TI  == preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  == the aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. one hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. on the basis of these results,  80% alcohol, octenidine 0.1%, and chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro  model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. the results of  the questionnaire revealed that chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and octenidine by 7% of the dentists. using the in vitro model, with the exception of s. aureus, chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. in contrast, the treatment with octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. the 80% alcohol was more efficient. no growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. on the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be  preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or octenidine using an incubation time  of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  == [molecular fingerprint of bacterial communities and 16s rdna intra-species heterogeneity: a pitfall that should be considered].
AB  == molecular fingerprinting methods are currently used to study microbial communities by culture independent approaches. they are proposed as identification tool owing to the availability of rapid automated methods. the 16s rrna gene (16s rdna) is an efficient marker for bacterial identification and microbial communities analysis. however, the 16s rdna polymorphism among strains  of the same species is an underestimated pitfall of the fingerprinting approaches. aim of the study: we studied the 16s rdna variability among strains of three bacterial species of medical interest. material and methods: total dna was extracted from clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=20), clostridium difficile (n=20) and enterobacter cloacae (n=14). the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) products obtained with consensus primers flanking the 16s rdna variable regions v3 and v6-v7-v8 were separated by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). dna extracted from ttge bands were sequenced and analysed. results: all the isolates of p. aeruginosa and of c. difficile displayed one single ttge band with constant migration distances suggesting that  there was no 16s rdna polymorphism among strains in these two species. oppositely, the isolates of e. cloacae gave complex ttge patterns formed by multiple bands with variable migration distances. these patterns corresponded to  16s rrna genes variable in a single genome as well as among strains of the species. conclusion: intra-species and/or intragenomic variability of 16s rdna should be taken into account for pertinent interpretation of molecular fingerprint. for this purpose, a comprehensive description of the polymorphism of this marker is necessary.

TI  == [selective action of broad-spectrum antibiotics on intestinal flora in sepsis in  rats].
AB  == objective: to investigate the selective effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the intestinal flora in sepsis in rats. methods: fifty-six sd rats were randomly  divided into normal control group, scald group [before ceftriaxone sodium (rocephin) treatment group], scald group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, scald group with 9 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group (before rocephin treatment group), sepsis group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group with 9 days of rocephin treatment. all the animals were incurred with 30% iii degree burns on their back followed by endotoxin challenge with a dose of 20  mg/kg 24 hours after the burn injury. the animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone 24 hours (60 mg/kg, quaque 12 hours) after the second hit with endotoxin. at the end of the treatment, the bacteria in stomach, intestine and colon were cultured. the number and kind of the bacteria were also determined. results: antibiotics significantly increased the number of  cocci (p<0.05 or p<0.01). the ratio between cocci and bacilli was markedly inverted. in selective culture of gut bacilli, e.coli was almost the only bacteria in the contents of stomach, intestine and colon in normal control group, but after burns and endotoxin challenge, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis appeared. after the rats received antibiotics treatment, e. coli decreased in number or disappeared, and was replaced mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus  and other bacilli. conclusion: broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce imbalance of bacteria flora in the gut, resulting in a reversion of the ratio between cocci and bacilli, and also reduction in intestinal colonization resistance. then, opportunistic pathogens become dominant flora in gut, which may cause antibiotic-related gut-origin diseases.

TI  == development of a base stacking hybridization-based microarray method for rapid identification of clinical isolates.
AB  == a base stacking hybridization-based microarray method was developed for rapid identification of clinical isolates within 2 h. the oligonucleotide probe sequences for species or genus-level identification were targeted against ribosomal rna. isolates were lysed and directly hybridized to the microarray-bound capture probes without conventional dna or rna isolation and prior polymerase chain reaction amplification. five bacterial species encountered frequently in the clinical setting, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae, and one genus enterococcus, could be discriminated by the microarray-based assay. identification by this method matched biochemical identification for 150 of 152 clinical strains. this base-stacking hybridization microarray offers a simple, fast (</=2 h), and accurate identification of bacterial cultures and is a potential tool for routine clinical diagnosis.

TI  == in71, an enterobacter cloacae blavim-1-carrying integron related to in70.2 from italian pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates: a sentry antimicrobial surveillance program report.
AB  == an enterobacter cloacae strain showing decreased susceptibility to carbapenems was isolated from a blood culture of a patient hospitalized in genoa, italy, and  screened for the presence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) genes as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. a bla(vim-1)-carrying integron named in71 nearly identical to in70.2 reported in pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from various italian cities since 2001 was identified in this strain. interestingly, the in71 did not carry aada1 nor possess the ispa7 usually found in the p. aeruginosa integron in70.2. mobilization of mbl genes from p. aeruginosa to members of the enterobacteriaceae family is very worrisome because  the rapid and wide dissemination of these potent antimicrobial resistance mechanisms could jeopardize the clinical use of carbapenems for the treatment of  multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae infections.

TI  == carbapenemases: the versatile beta-lactamases.
AB  == carbapenemases are beta-lactamases with versatile hydrolytic capacities. they have the ability to hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. bacteria producing these beta-lactamases may cause serious infections in which the carbapenemase activity renders many beta-lactams ineffective. carbapenemases are members of the molecular class a, b, and d beta-lactamases. class a and d enzymes have a serine-based hydrolytic mechanism,  while class b enzymes are metallo-beta-lactamases that contain zinc in the active site. the class a carbapenemase group includes members of the sme, imi, nmc, ges, and kpc families. of these, the kpc carbapenemases are the most prevalent, found  mostly on plasmids in klebsiella pneumoniae. the class d carbapenemases consist of oxa-type beta-lactamases frequently detected in acinetobacter baumannii. the metallo-beta-lactamases belong to the imp, vim, spm, gim, and sim families and have been detected primarily in pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, there are increasing numbers of reports worldwide of this group of beta-lactamases in the enterobacteriaceae. this review updates the characteristics, epidemiology, and detection of the carbapenemases found in pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  == although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the clsi currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of mbls. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (ddts) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa) and tris-edta (te) to detect mbls. sixteen isolates (4 acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 serratia marcescens isolate, 1 aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing imp-1, imp-1-like, imp-18, gim-1, spm-1, vim-2, vim-2-like, and chromosomal mbls and 20 isolates (7 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 escherichia coli isolates, 5 enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 s. marcescens isolates, 1 proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 a. baumannii isolates) producing non-mbl carbapenemases, ampc beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. the ddt method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (te, high-strength te, mpa, and te plus 20 microl of mpa [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mem), ertapenem (ert), and ceftazidime (caz). ddts with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 1:320 mpa detected all mbls and yielded no false-positive  results. some, but not all, mbl producers were detected in ipm-based tests involving the single chelator te or mpa alone or by ert- or caz-based tests. ipm-based tests with mpa concentrations other than 1:320 and all mem-based tests  had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. ddt with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 mpa appears to be convenient for the detection of mbls in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiling of cefepime in plasma and peritoneal fluid of abdominal surgery patients.
AB  == this study was conducted to characterise the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cefepime in plasma and peritoneal fluid (pf). one gram of cefepime was administered to eight laparotomy patients and plasma and pf samples  were collected at the end of 0.5 h infusion and every hour for 6 h. drug concentrations were determined, analysed by population pharmacokinetic modelling  and used for a monte carlo simulation with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) data. the maximum concentration in pf was two-thirds of the value in plasma; however, the concentrations were higher in pf than in plasma at 0.68 h post dose. the probabilities of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (65% of the time above  the mic) were 92-99% in plasma (90% fraction unbound) and 93-100% in pf against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae with a regimen of 1 g every 12 h. however, 1 g every 8 h or 2 g every 12 h was required for values of 94-95% in plasma and 95-96% in pf against pseudomonas aeruginosa. these results demonstrate that the pharmacodynamic exposures in pf were almost identical to those estimated from plasma data and provided a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic rationale for the dosing regimen for surgical intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == [bile duct infections as a late complication after endoscopic sphincterotomy].
AB  == nowadays endoscopic sphincterotomy (se) is considered to be a "gold standard" in  the treatment of residual choledocholithiasis and biliary pancreatitis. nevertheless patients after invasive procedures concerning bile ducts with destruction of oddi's sphincter often have increased succeptibility to chronic infections of bile ducts. aim: assessment of the influence of se on bacterial colonization, development of main bile duct chronic inflammation and recurrent choledocholithiasis. material and methods: we included to the study 50 patients with main bile duct lithiasis, who underwent endoscopic cholangiopancreatography  (ercp). among them there were 32 women in age from 45 to 87 (mean 69.7 +/- 12.3)  and 18 men in age from 39 to 84 (mean 59.8 +/- 11.56). the studied group was divided into 3 subgroups: in i (control) group were included 10 patients diagnosed with ercp techniques because of jaundice of unknown origin. those patients did't have ercp or operative revision of bile ducts before, but all of them underwent cholecystectomy in the past. each ii and iii group consisted of 20 patients, who underwent se before 12-24 and 25-36 months earlier respectively. sterile uodenoscope was inserted to the region of major duodenal papilla, and then a sterile brush was used to collect material to cytological smear (brushing) from main bile duct. in all groups 2 ml of bile were taken by a catheter to a syringe. on the basis of radiograms from ercp findings, the width of main bile duct was assessed. in all patients blood cell count, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, gammaglutamyltranspeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, bilirubin, c-reactive protein and procalcitonine levels were measured. results: in our study all 40 patients with previously performed endoscopic sphincterotomy  (se) had bacterial colonization in bile ducts, mostly with gramm negative pathogens. the most virulent pathogens vere cultured from bile duct swabs from patients after two or more revisions of common bile duct, and after a longer time from sphincterotomy. those patients had multibacterial bile duct infections (escherichia coli + pseudomonas aeruginosa; p. aeruginosa + enterococcus faecalis; e. faecalis + enterobacter cloacae + candida albicans; p. aeruginosa +  e. cloacae). e. coil and e. faecalis were most frequently cultured (20 and 16 cases respectively). it was observed that with length of time from endoscopic sphincterotomy, the width of main bile duct and also amount of cultured pathogens and their virulency grow. elevated transaminases activity and serum procalcitonine levels were observed in studied groups. 9 patients after previous  sphincterotomy had recurrent lithiasis. conclusions: sphincterotomy contributes to colonization of main bile duct with pathogenic bacteria. with length of time from endoscopic sphincterotomy, and amount of performed endoscopic sphincterotomies the amount of cultured pathogens, their virulency and drug resistance grow. chronic infection of bile ducts after endoscopic sphincterotomy  causes higher risk of recurrent lithiasis.

TI  == frequency of detection of periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria in hiv-positive patients with periodontitis.
AB  == objective: the aim of this investigation was to establish the frequency of detection of periodontopathic bacteria and gram-negative enteric rods in hiv-positive (hiv+) patients with periodontitis. materials and methods: clinical  parameters and microbiological samples were obtained from 31 hiv+ periodontitis (h+pg) patients, 32 hiv-negative (hiv-) periodontitis (h-pg) patients and 32 systemically and periodontally healthy (cg) patients. microbial samples were analyzed using culturing techniques for periodontopathic and superinfecting microorganisms. the anova test was used to assess differences in the clinical parameters, and the chi square and two-tailed mann whitney tests were used to find differences in the composition of the microbiota (p < 0.05). results: the frequency of detection of periodontopathic bacteria was higher in hiv- periodontitis patients (p < 0.05) compared to hiv+ and healthy subjects. in contrast, hiv+ patients harbor higher levels of superinfecting microorganisms (p  < 0.05). pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae were identified. conclusions: the frequency of detection and levels of periodontopathic bacteria were higher in the hiv- periodontitis patients compared to hiv+ patients and healthy subjects. in contrast, levels of superinfecting bacteria were found to be elevated in hiv+ periodontitis patients. special attention should be paid to the presence of periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria in these patients in order to avoid further periodontal and systemic complications.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == [characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

AB  == background: investigators who perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) modeling with monte carlo simulation have historically not stratified microbiological data by culture site. this lack of stratification might be problematic if susceptibility patterns differ among sites and might lead to differences in pk-pd. objective: this study compared the pk-pd of 2 antimicrobial regimens against 5 gram-negative bacterial species form 3 culture sites. methods: this data analysis was performed at the department of pharmacology, the university of texas health science center, san antonio, texas. blood, pulmonary (ie, bronchial, endotracheal, lung, respiratory, sputum, and tracheal secretions), and wound distributions of mics were extracted from the 2002 intensive care unit surveillance system database. bacteria included acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the pk properties of piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 4 hours) and piperacillin (3 g every 4 hours) were obtained from studies in healthy volunteers. monte carlo simulation was used in 10,000 patients for each antimicrobial-bacteria-culture site combination. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for a free percentage time above the mic of > or =50% was determined for each combination, and a clinically significant difference was defined a priori as > or =10%. results: data from 2408 pulmonary, 490 blood, and  242 wound isolates were included. for piperacillin/tazobactam, the cfr varied <10% by culture site in all 5 bacterial species. site-specific differences were noted in mic50 for piperacillin versus e cloacae and e coli and mic90 for piperacillin/tazobactam versus k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa. likewise, for piperacillin, the cfr was similar among the 3 culture sites for p aeruginosa. however, the cfr for piperacillin varied by > or =10% for a baumannii (blood > wound), e cloacae (pulmonary > blood), e coli (pulmonary and blood > wound), and  k pneumoniae (wound > blood). conclusions: the pk-pd models based on pk properties found in healthy humans and site-specific mic distributions in this study suggest that for piperacillin, culture-site differences subsequently resulted in cfr differences that exceeded a predetermined level of clinical significance. furthermore, these data suggest that traditional reporting strategies for microbiological data (ie, mic50 and mic90) might fail to adequately characterize the mic population.

(n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

AB  == the aim of this retrospective study was to describe signs, symptoms, and clinical outcomes of individuals undergoing intrathecal baclofen (itb) therapy who experienced pump-related gram-negative infections including meningitis. participants included 12 individuals (nine males, three females) aged 10 to 32 years (mean 17y 9mo), nine of whom had quadriplegic cp. a total of 571 baclofen pump surgeries were performed with 45 total infections. of the 45 infections, 12  were by gram-negative organisms, two resulting in meningitis. ten of 12 gram-negative infections (21 site encounters) occurred within 60 days of surgery. eleven of 12 pumps were explanted. by site encounters, pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for eight gram-negative infections, escherichia coli for five, proteus  for three, enterobacter cloacae for two, and klebsiella, enterobacter aerogenes,  and enterobacter vulnaris for one each. two individuals with gram-negative meningitis were admitted 72 to 96 hours after hospital discharge following pump replacement. both patients had rapid deterioration requiring transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit, and developed coagulopathy and decrease in responsiveness. both have improved and have elected not to replace the itb pump.  in gram-negative infections in itb therapy, the progression of signs and symptoms can be swift and devastating. identification of the infectious agent in such cases is imperative; these infections can quickly become life threatening.

TI  == [infection pathogen analysis of 2388 patients in an open hematology ward from 1993 to 2004].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence of infection and pathogens in hematology  ward. methods: the data of incidence, pathogen, and outcome of infection of 2388  hospitalized patients in an open hematology ward of peking union medical college  hospital from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. results: the overall incidence of infection was 34.3% according to the person-times of hospitalization, 24.4% for nosocomial infection and 9.9% for community-acquired infection. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infection were gram  negative. the most common bacteria in the sputum samples included enterobacter (27%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) and coagulase negative staphylococcus (mrscon, 12%), the most common bacteria in the blood samples included escherichia coli (43%), enterobacter cloacae (11%), and klebsiella (11%). whereas in the community-acquired infection the most common bacteria in the sputum samples were  haemophilus parainfluenzae (15%), mrscon (28%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and the most common bacteria in the blood samples were mrscon (28%), e. coli (28%), and klebsiella (9.4%). fungi were more often found in nosocomial infection, especially in the sputum samples. 12-year follow up showed that in nosocomial infection pseudomonas aeruginosa remained the most common bacteria in  the sputum samples, whereas e. coli and enterobacter cloacae became the major bacteria in the blood samples. in community-acquired infection, the proportion of staphylococcus aureus, that of klebsiella in blood samples, and that of e. coli in throat swab samples increased in recent years. the incidence of fungi infection had increased in both nosocomial infection and community acquired infection. the mortality of nosocomial infection was 6.1%, higher than that of the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant (p = 0.17). there was a trend of decrease in the mortality of community-acquired infection but did not in the nosocomial infection. conclusion: the patients in hematology ward are susceptible to infection, especially nosocomial infection that has a higher mortality rate in comparison with the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant. the pathogens of nosocomial infection are most likely g- bacteria, fungi and other bacteria resistant to most antibiotics. the mortality rate of nosocomial infection remains almost unchanged  in the 12-year follow up.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mic90 of mepm for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. mepm were active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (ipm) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (87.9%). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in proteus mirabilis. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which mic90 of  mepm was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in  conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful  carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == prevalences of zoonotic bacteria among seabirds in rehabilitation centers along the pacific coast of california and washington, usa.
AB  == many seabirds are rehabilitated annually by wildlife rehabilitation centers along the pacific coast, usa. although various strains of zoonotic bacteria have been isolated from seabirds, risks to rehabilitators at these centers have not been well documented. from november 2001 through january 2003, we determined the prevalence of detectable enteric fauna by isolation and characterization of gram-negative bacteria from cloacal swabs taken from 26 common murres (uria aalge), 49 gulls (larus spp.), and 14 other seabirds treated by rehabilitators in california and washington (usa). at least 25 bacterial species were identified, including multiple strains of escherichia coli, as well as enterobacter cloacae,  citrobacter freundii, and klebsiella pneumoniae. antibiotic resistance was found  in 13 of 19 bacterial isolates tested, including e. coli, k. pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. potential transfer of these bacteria poses a risk to wildlife rehabilitators and to seabirds in these centers, as well as to free-ranging birds.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == plasmid-mediated high-level gentamicin resistance among enteric bacteria isolated from pet turtles in louisiana.
AB  == the sale of small turtles is banned by the food and drug administration from the  u.s. market due to concerns about their excretion of salmonella spp. to produce a safe pet for the export market, the louisiana pet turtle industry uses gentamicin sulfate baths (1,000 microg/ml) to eradicate salmonella spp. from turtle eggs. in 1999, we analyzed bacterial samples recovered from turtle farms and found that strains of salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae and other bacteria, such as enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were resistant to high concentrations of gentamicin (>2,000 microg/ml) and to other aminoglycosides. the goal of this study was to identify the gene(s) which contributes to the high-level gentamicin resistance phenotype observed in bacteria from environmental samples with turtle farming activity, particularly the salmonellae, and to estimate the incidence of such genes in these bacteria. r plasmids from gentamicin-resistant strains were transferred by conjugation and transformation to naive escherichia coli cells. cloning and sequencing of the gentamicin resistance determinants on these plasmids revealed the presence of the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase genes aac(3)-iia and aac(3)-via; the latter was present as a gene cassette of a class 1 integron. multiplex pcr assays showed that every gentamicin-resistant isolate carried one of these acetyltransferase genes. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme digestion analysis of r plasmids carrying these genes revealed different restriction profiles and sizes, indicating a dissemination of  the gentamicin resistance genes through mobile molecular elements. the data presented highlight the need to develop an alternate method for the eradication of salmonella spp. from turtle eggs.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of silver dressings: an in vitro comparison.
AB  == a range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. the antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive acinetobacter  baumannii (bm4454), using a broth culture method. the rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. all five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter species, proteus species and e. coli. the spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. acticoat and contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumanii. other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with mrsa.

AB  == acute, uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most commonly  encountered bacterial infections and management has been made more complicated in the last decade due to the trend toward increasing antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx). fluoroquinolones are suggested as alternative antimicrobials for the treatment of utis in communities  for which tmp/smx resistance is > or = 10%. the mutant-prevention concentration (mpc) is a novel susceptibility parameter designed to minimize the selection of first-step resistant mutants present in large, > or = 10(10) cfu/ml, heterogeneous bacterial populations and is a distinct measurement from minimum inhibitory concentration testing. we measured mpc results for 80 enteric gram-negative and 20 pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary isolates against ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin mpc results for escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa respectively were 0.5, 1, 1, 1 and 4 mg/l; 1, 2, 4, 2 and 16 mg/l; 1, 8, >8, 4 and > or = 32 mg/l. by comparison, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)90 results for the enterobacteriaceae organisms ranged from < or = 0.06-4 mg/l for the three drugs and 1-4 mg/l against p. aeruginosa. similarly, mbc90 results ranged from < or = 0.06-4 mg/l and 2-8 mg/l respectively. for ciprofloxacin against e. coli, e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae and for levofloxacin against e. coli, c. freundii and k. pneumoniae, mpc results were below susceptible breakpoints and within clinically achievable and sustainable drug concentrations for >24 hours of the dosing interval against. for garenoxacin, urine drug concentrations are expected  to be in excess of mpc results for the entire length of the dosing interval for e. coli. application of mpcs to fluoroquinolones and management of utis represents a situation where high levels of in vitro activity, based on low mics, is reflected in correspondingly low mpc values for most of the organisms tested.  incorporation of mpc strategies into current fluoroquinolone dosing in uti represents a realistic approach for preventing the further selection of resistant organisms associated with utis.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the south american bullfrog leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  == norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the south american bullfrog, leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. the primary structure of a  previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as gly-leu-leu-asp-thr-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asn-val-val-gly-ser-leu-ala-ser-lys-v al-met-glu-lys-leu.nh2. the second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the caribbean mountain chicken frog l. fallax. pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b) but potencies were relatively low (mic values in the range 25-200 microm). the peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (ld50>400 microm).

TI  == calcaneal osteomyelitis due to fistulization of an ulcerated rheumatoid nodule.
AB  == calcaneal osteomyelitis is uncommon and difficult to treat. cases due to fistulization of an infected rheumatoid nodule are exceedingly rare. patient: a 65-year-old patient with nodular rheumatoid arthritis (ra) experienced osteomyelitis of the left calcaneus due to inoculation from a fistula draining an ulcerated rheumatoid nodule. pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae were recovered. the conventional treatment of calcaneal osteomyelitis relies on antibiotics and calcanectomy or foot amputation. we used two appropriate antibiotics and monthly intravenous injections of 90 mg of pamidronate. result: one year into treatment, the patient was free of pain and the skin wound was fully healed. on a follow-up computed tomography (ct) scan, the fistulous tract was seen to be closed and the large calcaneal defect almost completely filled with new bone. conclusion: combining two antibiotics and pamidronate may be a viable alternative to excision surgery or amputation in some patients with bone infection carrying a risk of fracture.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria in brazilian hospitals: the mystic program brazil 2003.
AB  == establish the susceptibility pattern of gram-negative bacteria causing infections in icu patients, mystic program brazil 2003. gram-negative bacteria (n = 1,550) causing nosocomial infections were collected at 20 brazilian centers. the central laboratory confirmed the identification and performed the susceptibility tests by etest methodology (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) for meropenem, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin. interpretation criteria used were according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.3%) was the most frequent isolate, followed by e. coli (18.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16.9%), acitenobacter baumannii (8.8%), and enterobacter cloacae (7.1%). pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=470) isolates presented susceptibility  rates of 64% to meropenem, 63.8% to piperacillin/tazobactam, 63.4% to amikacin, 58.7% to imipenem. acitenobacter baumannii presented susceptibility rates to meropenem of 97.1%, and 73% to tobramycin. e. coli and k. pneumoniae were highly  susceptible to both carbapenems. carbapenem resistance among the enterobacteriaceae is still rare in the region. acitenobacter baumannii and p. aeruginosa presented elevated resistance rates to all antimicrobials. since they  play an important role in nosocomial infections in this environment, the use of empirical combination therapy to treat these pathogens may be justified.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-023 (ro4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-023 (ro4908463, formerly r-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the c-2  position. its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. cs-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cs-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against p. aeruginosa and mrsa, with mics at  which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. cs-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris. cs-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the in vivo  efficacy of cs-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of prsp (serotypes 6 and 19). against the systemic infections with prsp, mrsa, and p. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of cs-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin  (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against p. aeruginosa infections only). these results suggest that cs-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including mrsa and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin under various conditions against standard strains, beta-lactam resistant strains, and multidrug efflux system mutants].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of fosfomycin (fom) as prophylactic antibiotic in terms of antimicrobial activity and the potential of inducibility of beta-lactamase, compared with cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, and piperacillin that are commonly used as perioperative agents. the in vitro activity of fom against aerobic gram-negative bacteria using mueller-hinton agar or nutrient agar supplemented with glucose-6-phosphate (g6p)  as tested medium increased within a range from 2 to 256 times the activity in the medium without g6p. however, the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria to fom  remained largely unchanged with or without g6p. there was no aerobic- or anaerobic-bacteria which changed susceptibility against beta-lactam antibiotics under various tested medium conditions. fom demonstrated strong bactericidal activity against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a dose dependent  manner, and decreased viable cell counts of staphylococcus aureus. in the case of p. aeruginosa, transmission electron micrographs study revealed that numerous lysed cells were present 2 hours after treatment with fom at four times the mic.  first and second generation cephalosporins induced ampc-type beta-lactamase in a  dose dependent manner among beta-lactamase inducible strains of p. aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. on the other hand, inducible activity of fom on beta-lactamase production was less than 1/25 to 1/65 compared with those of cephalosporins. in addition, fom maintained strong antimicrobial activity for over then 20 years after marketing, because of the excellent stability against various types of beta-lactamase produced by plasmid-carrying bacteria and clinical isolates. fom was not extruded by four types of efflux systems, such as  mexab-oprm, mexcd-oprj, mexxy/ oprm and mexef-oprn, however beta-lactam antibiotics were substrates of mexab-oprm and mexcd-oprj. in conclusion, fom provides adequate coverage for both aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria causing postoperative infections. further, fom would not select/concentrate beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the clinical fields and would not be a substrate for multidrug efflux system of p. aeruginosa.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == objective: bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. this study describes the species of gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. design: interventional study. setting: two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. patients: neonates hospitalized for >or  =24 hrs. interventions: prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from march 2001 to january 2003. hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. measurements and main results: there were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by gram-negative bacilli. among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). eleven and 24 gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. the most common gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), escherichia coli (21.2%), enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and serratia marcescens (11.2%). in contrast, acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), k. pneumoniae (11.7%), e. cloacae (10.6%), k. oxytoca (10.6%), and pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae,  and e. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). resistance patterns were similar between gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among  neonatal isolates of k. pneumoniae (p < .05). conclusions: gram-negative bacilli  species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.

"mdr-gnb isolates" were defined as pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella species isolates with resistance to at least 3 antimicrobial groups. a case-control study was performed to determine the independent risk factors for harboring mdr-gnb at hospital admission. results: between 1998 and 2003, the prevalence of mdr-gnb isolates recovered from patients at hospital admission increased significantly for all isolate species (p < .001), with the exception of p. aeruginosa (p = .09). of 464 mdr-gnb isolates, 12%, 35%, and 53% of isolates were coresistant to 5, 4, and 3 antimicrobial groups, respectively. multivariable analysis identified age > or = 65 years (odds ratio [or], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.1-7.4; p < .04), prior exposure to antibiotics for > or = 14 days (or, 8.7; 95% ci, 2.5 -30; p < .001), and prior residence in a long-term care facility (or, 3.5; 95% ci, 1.3-9.4; p < .01) as independent risk factors for harboring mdr-gnb at hospital admission. conclusion: a substantial number of patients harbor mdr-gnb at hospital admission. identification of common coresistance patterns among mdr-gnb isolates may assist  in the selection of empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients with a high risk of harboring mdr-gnb.

TI  == respiratory pathogens in dental plaque of hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases.
AB  == bacterial cultivation studies have shown that dental plaque is a reservoir for respiratory pathogens in intensive care unit patients and in elderly who are debilitated, hospitalized or in a nursing home, placing them at risk of bacterial pneumonia. no information is available, however, concerning dental plaque as a reservoir of putative respiratory pathogens in hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases. supragingival plaque colonization of 34 hospitalized chronic lung-diseased romanian citizens, excluding those with tuberculosis and less than  20 teeth, was therefore assessed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using a selected panel of whole genomic dna probes produced from eight respiratory pathogens and eight oral pathogens. thirty-one lung-healthy dental outpatients served as reference population. respiratory pathogens were detected in plaque from 29 of the 34 (85.3%) hospitalized patients and 12 of the 31 (38.7%) reference population subjects. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacter cloacae occurred significantly (p<0.05) more frequent among the hospitalized patients. hospitalized chronic lung-diseased patients harbored in their supragingival plaque samples bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia significantly (p<0.001) more frequent than lung-healthy dental outpatients. our results indicate that dental plaque in patients with chronic lung diseases often serves as a reservoir of bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia in susceptible individuals.

TI  == evaluation by monte carlo simulation of the pharmacokinetics of two doses of meropenem administered intermittently or as a continuous infusion in healthy volunteers.
AB  == meropenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibacterial agent. in order to optimize levels in plasma relative to the mics, the ideal dose level and dosage regimen need to be determined. the pharmacokinetics of meropenem were studied in  two groups, each comprising eight healthy volunteers who received the following doses: 500 mg as an intravenous infusion over 30 min three times a day (t.i.d.) versus a 250-mg loading dose followed by a 1,500 mg continuous infusion over 24 h for group a and 1,000 mg as an intravenous infusion over 30 min t.i.d. versus a 500-mg loading dose followed by a 3,000-mg continuous infusion over 24 h for group b. meropenem concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography with uv detection, respectively. pharmacokinetic calculations were done by use of a two-compartment open model, and the data were extrapolated by monte carlo simulations for 10,000 simulated subjects for pharmacodynamic evaluation. there were no significant differences in total clearance and renal clearance between group a and group b or between the intermittent treatment and the continuous infusion. the analyses of the probability of target attainment by  mic for the high- and low-dose continuous infusions were robust up to mics of 4 mg/liter and 2 mg/liter, respectively. the corresponding values for intermittent  infusions were only 0.5 mg/liter and 0.25 mg/liter. when these observations were  correlated with mics obtained from the mystic database, intermittent infusion results in adequate activity against two of the most common nosocomially acquired pathogens, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. however, against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the evaluation shows a clear advantage of high-dose therapy administered as a continuous infusion. we believe that in the empirical therapy situation, the continuous-infusion mode of administration is most worth the extra efforts. we conclude that clinical trials for evaluation of the continuous infusions of meropenem in critically ill patients are warranted.

TI  == mechanisms of resistance of bacteria causing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == the common causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter spp) are frequently resistant to multiple antibiotic classes. s aureus develops resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics by producing a modified penicillin-binding protein. linezolid resistance arises by way of mutations in the 23s ribosomal subunit. antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacilli usually arises by way of beta-lactamase production, upregulation of efflux pumps, or loss of outer membrane proteins. the ability of bacteria to develop and disseminate new mechanisms of antibiotic resistance may outstrip the availability of new antibiotic classes.

TI  == the effect of an antimicrobial drain sponge dressing on specific bacterial isolates at tracheostomy sites.
AB  == patients with tracheostomies frequently experience complications, including bacteremia, sepsis, pneumonia, and multi antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. a prospective, descriptive, randomized, controlled, clinical case series involving seven men and three women was conducted on patients in the neuroscience unit of a long-term rehabilitation hospital during a period of 25 days to compare the use of an nonwoven drain sponge dressing containing an antimicrobial (polyhexamethylene biguanide) to a non-impregnated, nonwoven drain  sponge dressing on tracheostomy sites. specifically, the purpose of the study was to compare the presence of four bacterial pathogens (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus) and resident normal skin flora (alpha-hemolytic streptococci and staphylococcus epidermidis) at the tracheostomy sites. culture results for total days of growth showed an absence of pathogens and presence of normal skin flora for 11 study days in patients randomized to the antimicrobial dressing group and an absence of pathogens and presence of normal skin flora for  six study days in patients randomized to the control group. the results of this descriptive case series suggest that an antimicrobial drain sponge dressing could be an important adjunct in the control of infections in patients with tracheostomies without compromising normal skin flora.

TI  == structure-activity relationship of 6-methylidene penems bearing tricyclic heterocycles as broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitors: crystallographic structures show unexpected binding of 1,4-thiazepine intermediates.
AB  == the design and synthesis of a series of seven tricyclic 6-methylidene penems as novel class a and c serine beta-lactamase inhibitors is described. these compounds proved to be very potent inhibitors of the tem-1 and ampc beta-lactamases and less so against the class b metallo-beta-lactamase ccra. in combination with piperacillin, their in vitro activities enhanced susceptibility  of all class c resistant strains from various bacteria. crystallographic structures of a serine-bound reaction intermediate of 17 with the class a shv-1 and class c gc1 enzymes have been established to resolutions of 2.0 and 1.4 a, respectively, and refined to r-factors equal 0.163 and 0.145. in both beta-lactamases, a seven-membered 1,4-thiazepine ring has formed. the stereogenic c7 atom in the ring has the r configuration in the shv-1 intermediate and has both r and s configurations in the gc1 intermediate. hydrophobic stacking interactions between the tricyclic c7 substituent and a tyrosine side chain, rather than electrostatic or hydrogen bonding by the c3 carboxylic acid group, dominate in both complexes. the formation of the 1,4- thiazepine ring structures  is proposed based on a 7-endo-trig cyclization.

TI  == an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog leptodactylus fallax (anura:leptodactylidae).
AB  == a 25 amino-acid-residue, c-terminally alpha-amidated peptide with antimicrobial activity, which has been termed fallaxin, was isolated in high yield from the norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog leptodactylus fallax (anura:leptodactylidae). the amino acid sequence of the peptide (gly-val-val-asp-ile-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asp-ile-ala-gly-his-leu-ala-ser-lys- val-met-asn-lys-leu.nh2) shows structural similarity with members of the ranatuerin-2 family previously isolated from the skins of frogs of the genus rana that are only distantly related to the leptodactylidae. this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that many frog skin antimicrobial peptides are related evolutionarily, having arisen from multiple duplications of an ancestral  gene that existed before the radiation of the different families. fallaxin inhibited the growth of reference strains of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae) but with relatively low potency (mic> or =20 microm) and was inactive against the gram-positive bacterium (staphylococcus aureus) and the yeast candida albicans. the hemolytic activity of fallaxin was very low (hc50>200 microm). a second peptide, comprising residues (1-22) of fallaxin, was also isolated from the skin  secretions but this component was inactive against the microorganisms tested.

TI  == [development and evaluation of a pcr method for diagnosis of salmonella enteric fever, based on dna sequences of the hila gene].
AB  == typically, diagnosis of enteric fever due to salmonella spp. is by bacterial isolation from blood culture; however, the blood culture method is slow, not always available, and not informative in patients with antibiotic treatment. salmonella spp. uses the hila gene (component of the pathogenicity island i) to invade epithelial cells and produce infection. using the hila gene sequence a pcr test was designed to detect salmonella in blood samples. the sensitivity (s), specificity (sp), positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) of the pcr method were obtained by testing the blood samples from 34 patients with suspected of enteric fever. presence of s. typhi was confirmed by blood culture. blood samples were also tested from 35 patients with infections due to other non-salmonella pathogens, again corroborated by blood culture (klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; serratia marcescens, 5; escherichia coli, 4; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; providencia alcalifaciens, 4; enterobacter cloacae, 4). control samples were obtained from 150 healthy volunteers. the s, sp, ppv and npv for the pcr method were all 100%. the lowest number of colony forming units/ml detected by pcr in blood samples was 10.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == pcr method based on the ogdh gene for the detection of salmonella spp. from chicken meat samples.
AB  == in a previous paper, the ogdh gene that encodes 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was  isolated from salmonella typhimurium. the catalytic n-terminal region in the enzyme was found to be very specific for the salmonella species. therefore, the aim of the present study was to detect s. typhimurium in food sources using primers designed for ogdh-1 and ogdh-2 which were based on the salmonella-specific region of the ogdh gene. a simple polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection method was developed to detect low numbers of s. typhimurium in a chicken meat microbial consortium. using the ogdh-specific primers under stringent amplification conditions and for gene probe analysis, fewer than 100 colony-forming units (cfus) were detectable when pure cultures were employed. when the pcr assay was run on s. typhimurium-contaminated meat contents, only the positive meat samples containing as few as 200 cfus reacted to the assay. the method employed for sample processing is simple and it was determined to provide  a sensitive means of detecting trace amounts of s. typhimurium-specific sequences in the presence of mixed meat microbial populations. when compared with six representative intestinal gram-negative bacterial strains in foods, including vibrio parahaemolyticus, v. vulnificus, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus sp., s. typhimurium had a unique and distinct pcr product (796 bp). in conclusion, the two ogdh primers were found to be rapid  and sensitive detectors of salmonella spp for the pcr method.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  == four carbapenems have been available clinically in japan. these are imipenem/cilastatin (imip/cs) and panipenem/ betamipron (pani/bp) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (biap) and meropenem (mero). the latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. the antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against enterobacteriacae such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli containing the class c-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (pipc) and ceftazidime (ctaz).  against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem  showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to pipc and ctaz. high activities were also seen against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected.  the first generation carbapenems showed better activity against e. faecalis than  newer carbapenems. all four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (utis). however, pani/bp is less effective in utis caused by p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. mero showed better eradication rate of p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated utis, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis.

AB  == we sought to characterize the molecular epidemiology of gram-negative bacilli (gnb) causing infections in infants and associated with carriage on nurses' hands after hand hygiene was performed. from march 2001 to january 2003, gnb caused 192 (34%) of 562 hospital-acquired infections in the 2 participating neonatal intensive care units (nicus) and were isolated from the hands of 45 (38%) of 119  nurses. five species--klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae, all of which were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis--caused 169 (88%) of 192 of gnb infections. overall, 58% of infections were caused by unique strains not cultured from other  infants or nurses, and 31% of infections were part of unrecognized molecular clusters. in contrast, only 9% of strains that caused infections were cultured from nurses' hands. these data suggest that practices in addition to hand hygiene are needed to prevent horizontal transmission of gnb in the nicu.

TI  == resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (uti). during a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. fever higher than 38.5 degrees c was significantly more common in the bacteremic group  than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. e. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic uti than non-bacteremic uti (73% vs 49%; p<0.01).  bacteria other than e. coli (i.e., k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, proteus spp., morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic uti than bacteremic uti (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). e. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). isolates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and  proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. the emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic uti in taiwan. further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial  resistance on the outcome in these conditions.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolates from inpatients and outpatients at yaounde central hospital, cameroon.
AB  == objective: to determine and compare antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogenic bacteria from inpatients and outpatients at a university teaching hospital in yaounde, cameroon. methods: gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 522), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) from inpatients and outpatients at yaounde central hospital between march 1995 and april 1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). results: of the 522 isolates recorded, 80.3% were enterobacteriaceae. a high incidence of resistance to amoxicillin (85%), piperacillin (75%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (71%) was observed. the proportion of antimicrobial-resistant isolates from inpatients was significantly  higher than that from outpatients (p < 0.05), except for piperacillin, tobramicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the combinations of antimicrobial and organism showed that the percentage of ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter cloacae were 26.8% and 24% respectively. the rate of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from inpatients was not significantly higher than that in isolates from outpatients for all the antimicrobial/organism combinations, except for ceftazidime-resistant escherichia coli, which was exclusively found in isolates from inpatients. among enterobacteriaceae, high and low level penicillinase (mostly in e. coli (13.6% and 11% respectively) and klebsiella spp. (9% and 8% respectively) were the most  important beta-lactam resistance phenotypes (31.2% and 23.6%, respectively). wild type (exclusively observed in e. coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella spp.) and low level penicillinase were higher in outpatient than inpatient isolates (wild type--17.9% vs 10.8% and low level penicillinase--29.4% vs 20.5%, respectively; p < 0.05). however, extended spectrum beta-lactamase strains (klebsiella spp. (3.5%), e. coli (2.6%), citrobacter spp. (0.7%), enterobacter spp. (0.4%) and p.  mirabilis (0.2%)) were exclusively recovered from inpatients. penicillinase and high level cephalosporinase resistance phenotypes were frequently observed in non-fermenter gram-negative bacilli (46.6% and 29.1% respectively). however, there were no significant differences in penicillinase and cephalosporinase resistance between inpatient and outpatient isolates. conclusion: as the incidence of antimicrobial resistance is substantially higher in isolates from inpatient than outpatient pathogens, more resources should be allocated within the hospital to encourage good antibiotic practices and good hospital hygiene.

TI  == peritoneal fluid titer test for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
AB  == standard microbiological tests (i.e., mic) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (pd)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (pft) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. the methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. thirty-six clinical isolates, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. in the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis. titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. titers were  highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. overall, pfts were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (p < 0.0001). the addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa (p < 0.0001). in the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (p = 0.036). in conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the pft as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of pd-related peritonitis. with further characterization and validation in patients, the pft test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for pd-related peritonitis.

AB  == in this retrospective investigation, we documented the bacterial colonization of  79 patients with chronic wounds, who had been treated between january 2002 and may 2003 in an outpatient wound healing clinic of a university dermatology program. we isolated 106 facultative pathogenic bacterial strains of which 56 were staphylococcus aureus, 19 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 escherichia coli, 4 proteus mirabilis, 4 enterobacter cloacae, 2 serratia marcescens, 2 streptococcus group g und 8 further species. 68 of these bacterial strains were gram-positive and 46 gram-negative. moreover we identified one patient with candida parapsilosis. therefore, 70.8% of all patients showed staphylococcus aureus in their chronic wounds. determination of the specific resistances showed 17 patients to be colonized with oxacillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus (orsa) strain; this corresponds to 21.5% of all patients. consequently, 30.4% of all staphylococcus aureus isolates were orsa strains. all of the orsa isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. sensitivity to tetracycline was documented in 15, to amikacin in 13, to clindamycin in 7, to gentamicin and erythromycin in 6 of the orsa-positive patients. in the case of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 10 were sensitive and 3 were intermediate in sensitivity. beside the obligate resistance  to oxacillin, penicillin g, ampicillin, cefuroxime and imipenem, none of the orsa was sensitive to ofloxacin. the results of our investigations demonstrate the actual spectrum of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds of patients in an university dermatologic wound clinic and underline the growing problem of orsa.

TI  == the status of antimicrobial resistance in taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (tsar) program, 2000.
AB  == in a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (taiwan surveillance of  antimicrobial resistance, tsar), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers  and regional hospitals throughout taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (tsar  ii). this report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) in the tsar ii collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (tsar i) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. resistance of the 5 enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in e. coli, 68% in p. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in k. pneumonia to 66% in s. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in k.  pneumoniae to 70% in p. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in taiwan than most western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant a. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant e. coli (12%). differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in tsar ii; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout taiwan.

TI  == a family of brevinin-2 peptides with potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa from the skin of the hokkaido frog, rana pirica.
AB  == nine peptides displaying varying degrees of antimicrobial activity were extracted from the skin of the hokkaido frog, rana pirica. five structurally related peptides were identified as members of the brevinin-2 family. these peptides were active against reference strains of gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae) and gram-positive (staphlococcus aureus) bacteria but displayed relatively low hemolytic activity.  the most abundant peptide, brevinin-2pra (680 nmol/g weight of dry skin) showed high potency [minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values between 6 and 12 microm] against a range of clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa. in addition, activity was unaffected by nacl concentrations up to 200 mm. cladistic analysis based on the primary structures of brevinin-2 peptides supports a close phylogenetic relationship between r. pirica and japanese mountain brown frog rana ornativentris. one peptide of the ranatuerin-2 family and one strongly hemolytic  peptide of the brevinin-1 family were also isolated from the extract along with two members of the temporin family, temporin-1pra (ilpilgnllngll.nh(2)) and temporin-1prb (ilpilgnllnsll.nh(2)) that atypically lacked basic amino acid residues and showed only very weak antimicrobial and hemolytic activity.

TI  == increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in korea: konsar study in 2001.
AB  == the 5th year konsar surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. it was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. resistance rates of gram-positive cocci were: 70% of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. seventy-two percent of pneumococci were  nonsusceptible to penicillin. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae were: escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. with the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.

AB  == the integron content of gram-negative strains implicated in three distinct episodes of suspected cross-infection among inpatients was investigated and compared with ribotyping. in the first episode, ribotyping identified a strain of acinetobacter, isolated over a 3-month period, responsible for an outbreak associated with the use of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (icu). the second episode concerned simultaneous isolations of pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens from 13 bronchoscopy patients. in these two episodes, results obtained by analysis of integron content and ribotyping were in agreement and correctly identified the epidemiologically related strains. in the  third episode, isolates of enterobacter cloacae were collected from patients in the neonatal icu over a 3-month period. although several isolates belonged to the same ribotype, cross-infection could not always be confirmed when the integron content was analysed. integron detection can be considered a useful tool for studying molecular epidemiology in hospital environments, facilitating the quick  detection of possible cross-infection cases, especially in critical wards such as the icu.

TI  == microbiological contamination of enteral feeding solutions used in costa rican hospitals.
AB  == enteral feeding is the most common and preferred modality for providing nutritional support to hospital patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract that can not satisfy their nutritional requirements. nevertheless, enteral feeding may be an important cause of bacterial infection. the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial contamination level of enteral feedings distributed in costa rican hospitals. a total of 124 samples of enteral feeding, coming from  five different hospitals from san jose, costa rica, were evaluated during the second semester of 1997 and first of 1998 for the presence and identification of  total and fecal coliforms, pseudomonas sp. and listeria sp. a subpopulation of the pseudomonas isolated was analyzed for their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the concentration of gram negative rods in the samples of enteral feeding solutions ranged from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml, markedly exceeding the permissible level (10(2) cfu/ml or less). the coliforms most frequently isolated  included enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coil, serratia sp. and klebsiella pneumoniae. pseudomonas sp. was isolated in more than 70% of the samples made from commercial based solutions, fruits and vegetables. p. aeruginosa and p. fluorescens were the species most frequently isolated. listeria sp. was not isolated from enteral solutions samples. the results obtained demonstrate that it is urgent to assure strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feed in order to avoid bacterial growth. the implementation of haccp (hazard analysis and critical control points) system will be required in a near future for better quality control of enteral nutrition mixtures.

(b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [prostate histopathology of nih category iv prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the united states.
AB  == grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. a total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae (mic(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). for pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (mic(90),  2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (mic(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. none of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same mic(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae. grepafloxacin was very active against haemophilus influenzae (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and legionella spp. (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). these results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.

AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in esrd and removal by the cellulose acetate high performance-210 hemodialyzer.
AB  == background: no published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd). objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients. methods: eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression  analysis using adapt ii (biomedical simulations resource, university of southern  california, los angeles, ca). ratios of maximum serum concentration (c(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) data from published studies. results: all subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and c(max) were 37.0 ml/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 ml/min), 103.3 l (range, 39.8 to 139.3 l), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/ml (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/ml), respectively. median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 ml/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 ml/min)  and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. median c(max)-mic90 ratios were  10 or greater for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: the administration of levofloxacin to patients with esrd as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every  48 hours, will provide adequate c(max)-mic ratios after the first and subsequent  doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin mics of 1 microg/ml or less.

TI  == [surveillance on drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from hospital  acquired infections and community acquired infections (2000 - 2001)].
AB  == objective: to determine the resistance rates of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections (hai) or community acquired infections (cai) in the 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in china. methods: 1596 strains of gram-negative bacilli from the 2401 pathogenic strains isolated from 13 hospitals 1 july 2000 to 30 june 2001 were collected for susceptibility test using international standard two-fold agar dilution method. according to the criteria of guidelines of nccls (2001), mic(50) and mic(90) were detected for antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and r%, i%, and s%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of bacteria to the compounds tested. results: 15 species of gram-negative pathogens  were isolated and most of them could be isolated from both cai and hai patients.  the resistance rates of isolates, especially enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp.  and acinetobacter spp. from hai were higher than those of cai. the carbopenems were the most active compounds tested against enterobacteriaceae. cefoperozone/sulbactam and cefprime demonstrated excellent activity against most  of gram-negative bacilli. most of the gram-negative bacilli were still rather susceptible to cefatazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, with a susceptibility rate of 70% to 100%. fluoroquinolones showed strong and broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative bacilli, but more than 50% of escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and the susceptible  rates to fluoroquinolones of pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae had decreased. conclusion: (1) the results obtained in the two surveillance-years, 2000 - 2001 and 1998 - 1999, were similar in the bacterial resistance pattern and the trend of rising of resistant rates for some gram-negative pathogens. (2) the resistance rates of isolates from hai patients were higher than those of cai.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  == the influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

AB  == eighteen enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 16 of them with well-defined beta-lactam resistance mechanisms, were sent to 52 spanish microbiology laboratories. interpretative categories for 8 extended-spectrum beta-lactams were collected. participating laboratories used their own routine susceptibility testing procedures (88% automatic systems, 10% disk diffusion, and 2% agar dilution). control results were established by two independent reference  laboratories by applying the nccls microdilution method and interpretative criteria. interpretative discrepancies were observed in 16% of the results (4.4%  for cefepime, 3.0% for aztreonam, 2.8% for piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.7% for cefotaxime [ctx] and ceftazidime, 1.1% for ceftriaxone, 0.9% for meropenem, and 0.3% for imipenem). high consistency with reference values (<5% of major plus very major errors) was observed with (i) american type culture collection quality control strains; (ii) strains with low-efficiency mechanisms inactivating extended-spectrum beta-lactams, such as oxa-1-producing escherichiacoli or shv-1-hyperproducing klebsiella pneumoniae; (iii) strains with highly efficient mechanisms, such as shv-5 porin-deficient k. pneumoniae, ctx-m-10 in enterobacter cloacae hyperproducing ampc, and p. aeruginosa with the mexab oprm efflux phenotype or hyperproducing ampc. low consistency (>30% major plus very major errors) was detected in k1-producing klebsiella oxytoca, ctx-m-9-producing e. coli, and in oprd(-) p. aeruginosa strains. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains accounted for 86% of very major errors. recognition of the esbl phenotype was particularly low in enterobacter cloacae strains (<35%), due to the lack of nccls-specific rules in this genus. a k1-producing k. oxytoca  was misidentified by 10% of laboratories as an esbl producer. the use of well-defined resistant strains is useful for improving proficiency in susceptibility testing in clinical laboratories.

AB  == background: combination antimicrobial therapy is often necessary to eradicate infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. methods: to evaluate the potential benefit of aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combination therapy, the activity of aztreonam in combination with ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was assessed using checkerboard testing for four clinical isolates of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, burkholderia cepacia and pseudomanas aeruginosa. results: all aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations demonstrated additive activity [fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) index >0.5-4] or synergy (fic index <or=0.5) for all 24 isolates tested. aztreonam plus ciprofloxacin was the most effective combination, demonstrating synergy against 16.7% of isolates (2 p. mirabilis, 1 e. cloacae, 1 b. cepacia). aztreonam in combination with moxifloxacin was synergistic against 2 isolates (p. mirabilis, e. cloacae), and in combination with gatifloxacin against 1 isolate (e. cloacae). aztreonam and levofloxacin demonstrated only additive activity. conclusion: additive activity was observed for the majority of the aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations tested against six species of gram-negative bacilli. synergy involving aztreonam  and fluoroquinolone combinations was less common than additive activity and was isolate dependent. although in vivo clinical successes have been documented using aztreonam in combination with other agents, confirmation by laboratory techniques requires further investigation.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin, a new oral fluoroquinolone].
AB  == we compared antibacterial activity of nm394, which is the active metabolite of a  prodrug of new fluoroquinolone prulifloxacin (pufx), against clinical isolates of bacteria with those of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), levofloxacin (lvfx), gatifloxacin (gflx), tosufloxacin (tflx) and fleroxacin (flrx). 1. nm394 showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. 2. mic80 of nm394 for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. mic80 of nm394 for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae was lower than 0.06 microgram/ml. mic80 of nm394 for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.25 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively.  3. short-time bactericidal activity of nm394 against p. aeruginosa was stronger than those of cpfx, gflx, lvfx and tflx. 4. short-time bactericidal activity of nm394 at cmax concentration against 12 strains of p. aeruginosa was stronger than those of cpfx, lvfx, gflx and tflx.

TI  == production of ctx-m-3 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and imp-1 metallo beta-lactamase by five gram-negative bacilli: survey of clinical isolates from seven laboratories collected in 1998 and 2000, in the kinki region of japan.
AB  == the aim of this study was to research the distribution in the kinki region of japan of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) and metallo beta-lactamase (mbl). one thousand isolates, 200 of each of four enterobacterial species (i.e. escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens) and 200 of p. aeruginosa, were collected from seven different laboratories during two 2 month periods, one in 1998 and one in 2000. a double-disc synergy test (ddst) and 2-mercaptopropionic acid inhibition test (2-mpat) were used to confirm beta-lactamase-producing isolates. the ddst was positive for one isolate of e. coli, five of k. pneumoniae, two of e. cloacae and 14 of s. marcescens. the 2-mpat was positive for five isolates of s. marcescens and two of p. aeruginosa.  we identified the beta-lactamase type of each isolate by molecular confirmatory tests (isoelectric focusing, pcr and dna sequencing): ctx-m-3 esbls (three isolates of k. pneumoniae, two of e. cloacae and 13 of s. marcescens), ctx-m-2 esbl (one isolate of k. pneumoniae), shv-12 esbls (one isolate of e. coli and one of s. marcescens), ctx-m-3 and shv-12 combination esbl (one isolate of k. pneumoniae) and imp-1 mbls (five isolates of s. marcescens and two of p. aeruginosa). in conclusion, many species of gram-negative bacilli that produce ctx-m-3 esbls and imp-1 mbls were disseminated widely in different hospitals of the kinki region of japan. therefore, monitoring of laboratory bacterial ecology  seems important to stop the spread of these strains through nosocomial outbreaks.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == [antibacterial activities and pk/pd parameters of aminoglycosides against recent  clinical isolates of gram-negative rods].
AB  == we examined antibacterial activities and pk/pd parameters of six kinds of aminoglycosides against seven bacterial species of clinical isolates in 2001. aminoglycoseides examined were gentamicin (gm), dibekacin (dkb), tobramycin (tob), amikacin (amk), netilmicin (ntl), and isepamicin (isp), and bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus spp., serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all aminoglycosides showed good activities with low mics  against 6 species of enterobacteriacea except s. marcescens. eight strains (3.2%) among them were resistant to one or more aminoglycosides. resistance to multiple  aminoglycosides were detected in 16 strains (32%) of s. marcescens, among which 13 strains were resistant to amk but susceptible to isp. three (6%) strains of p. aeruginosa were resistant to multiple drugs, one of which was resistant to all six aminoglycosides, and others were moderately susceptible to amk and isp, and susceptible to gm, amk and isp. using a ratio of peak serum concentration to mic90 (cmax/mic90) or a ratio of area under the curve to mic90 (auc/mic90) as a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) parameter, we estimated the efficacy  of the drug. an excellent effect of isp, which was injected intramuscularly or intravenously at a dose of 400 mg, was expected for strains of enterobacteriacea  except s. marcescens. the cmax/mic90 ratios for s. marcescens were comparably higher in gm and isp and that for p. aeruginosa were rather high in tob when compared to other aminoglycosides. another pk/pd parameter, auc/mic90 ratio, was  high enough in ntl and isp for enterobacteriacea, suggesting good efficacy of these drugs. the (auc/mic90) ratios for s. marcescens were comparably high in gm  and isp, and that for p. aeruginosa were high in tob, dkb, and isp.

AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in karachi.
AB  == objective: to study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. setting: the study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) at pns shifa (naval hospital), karachi during january 1997 to june 1999. methods: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth.  subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by modified kirby baur disc diffusion technique. results: a  total of 212 organisms were isolated. these included staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), escherichia coli (n = 22), enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), citrobacter diversus (n = 5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group b streptococcus (n = 2). on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for acinetobacter baumannii. resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. conclusion: in view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.

TI  == application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

TI  == constitutive high expression of chromosomal beta-lactamase in pseudomonas aeruginosa caused by a new insertion sequence (is1669) located in ampd.
AB  == the expression of chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase in pseudomonas aeruginosa is negatively regulated by the activity of an amidase, ampd. in the present study we examined resistant clinical p. aeruginosa strains and several resistant variants  isolated from in vivo and in vitro biofilms for mutations in ampd to find evidence for the genetic changes leading to high-level expression of chromosomal  beta-lactamase. a new insertion sequence, is1669, was found located in the ampd genes of two clinical p. aeruginosa isolates and several biofilm-isolated variants. the presence of is1669 in ampd resulted in the expression of high levels of ampc beta-lactamase. complementation of these isolates with ampd from the reference p. aeruginosa strain pao1 caused a dramatic decrease in the expression of ampc beta-lactamase and a parallel decrease of the mic of ceftazidime to a level comparable to that of pao1. one highly resistant, constitutive beta-lactamase-producing variant contained no mutations in ampd, but a point mutation was observed in ampr, resulting in an asp-135-->asn change. an identical mutation of ampr in enterobacter cloacae has been reported to cause a 450-fold higher ampc expression. however, in many of the isolates expressing high levels of chromosomal beta-lactamase, no changes were found in either ampd, ampr, or in the promoter region of ampd, ampr, or ampc. our results suggest that multiple pathways may exist leading to increased antimicrobial resistance due to  chromosomal beta-lactamase.

TI  == cefcapene inactivates chromosome-encoded class c beta-lactamases.
AB  == the stability of cefcapene and cefpodoxime, oral antibacterial cephalosporins, toward different classes of beta-lactamases was evaluated. for the class a beta-lactamases, tem-1, shv-1, and nmc-a, only the steady-state kinetic parameter ( k(cat)/ km) values were calculated (3100 - 1.1 x 10(7) m(-1) x s(-1)), because  these enzymes have very high km values for cefpodoxime and cefotaxime. as for class b beta-lactamases l1, imp-1, and ccra, in general, similar k(cat)/ km values were obtained. however, regarding class c beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and citrobacter freundii, we found major differences in stability between the two compounds. cefpodoxime acted as a good substrate for the class c beta-lactamases, except for the enzyme from e. cloacae; its k(cat) and km values were successfully calculated ( k(cat)/ km, 1.8 x 10(5) - 1.2 x 10(7) m(-1) x s(-1)). on the other hand, cefcapene acted as a poor substrate or an inactivator for class c beta-lactamases; its k(2)/ k value was successfully calculated (8.7 x 10(5) - 7.0 x 10(6) m(-1) x s(-1)). in addition, k(3) values were determined for beta-lactamases from p. aeruginosa (2.3 x 10(-2) x s(-1)) and c. freundii (2.1 x  10(-1) x s(-1)). even though these values could be calculated, transient inactivation as an enzyme reactivation reaction for all these enzymes was observed. these findings suggest the potential of cephem compounds as inhibitors  of class c beta-lactamases.

AB  == objective: to determine if antimicrobial resistance occurs in various bacterial species isolated from rats. method: two hundred and fifteen rats were trapped from areas in and around nairobi, kenya. they were sacrificed and their intestinal, liver and spleen specimens obtained. various bacterial species were isolated from these specimens. the species were analysed for antimicrobial susceptibility to 12 commonly used antimicrobials using the disc diffusion technique. results: the bacterial species isolated included pathogenic and potentially pathogenic ones such as escherichia coli 137, salmonella typhimurium  1, klebsiella pneumoniae 2, enterobacter cloacae 4, enterobacter sakazakii 2, citrobacter freundii 3, morganella morganii (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 and burkhoddria cepacia 6. depending on the species, the resistance to the various antimicrobials were: 0-100% for cefotaxime, nalidixic acid, cefuroxime, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, co-amoxyclav, sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, trimethoprim and cephradine, 0-66.6% for gentamicin and 0-25% for apramycin. conclusion: the results showed that, rats from the study area harboured bacterial species with antimicrobial resistance. these micro-organisms may form an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance which could pose a public health hazard. control of rat populations, better management of sewer systems and waste  dumping sites are recommended in order to reduce occurrence of these drug resistance reservoirs.

TI  == prba, a gene coding for an esterase hydrolyzing parabens in enterobacter cloacae  and enterobacter gergoviae strains.
AB  == the new gene prba encodes an esterase responsible for the hydrolysis of the ester bond of parabens in enterobacter cloacae strain em. this gene is located on the chromosome of strain em and was cloned by several pcr approaches. the prba gene codes for an immature protein of 533 amino acids, the first 31 of which represent a proposed signal peptide yielding a mature protein of a putative molecular mass  of 54.6 kda. this enzyme presents analogies with other type b carboxylesterases,  mainly of eukaryotic origin. the cloning and expression of the prba gene in a strain of escherichia coli previously unable to hydrolyze parabens resulted in the acquisition of a hydrolytic capacity comparable to the original activity of strain em, along with an increased resistance of the transformed strain to methyl paraben. the presence of homologues of prba was tested in additional ubiquitous bacteria, which may be causative factors in opportunistic infections, including enterobacter gergoviae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas agglomerans, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and burkholderia cepacia. among the 41 total strains tested, 2 strains of e. gergoviae and 1 strain of burkholderia cepacia were able  to degrade almost completely 800 mg of methyl paraben liter(-1). two strains of e. gergoviae, named g1 and g12, contained a gene that showed high homology to the prba gene of e. cloacae and demonstrated comparable paraben esterase activities.  the significant geographical distance between the locations of the isolated e. cloacae and e. gergoviae strains suggests the possibility of an efficient transfer mechanism of the prba gene, conferring additional resistance to parabens in ubiquitous bacteria that represent a common source of opportunistic infections.

TI  == microbiology of acute otitis externa.
AB  == objective: to isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (aoe) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. study design: prospective core series. methods: specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. end point mean inhibitory concentration  (mic) testing was performed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) recommended methods. results: in alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the united states. a total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). the next 10 species most frequently isolated were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; microbacterium  alconae, 2.9%; staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; staphylococcus capitis subsp. ureolyticus,1.4%; and staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. susceptibility profiles of s. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/ml): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. susceptibility profiles of s. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%,  neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. p.  aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/ml for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. likewise, resistance of p. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. twenty isolates had neomycin mics >/=64 mcg/ml and 10 isolates had gentamicin mics >/=16 mcg/ml. the coryneform isolates identified as  microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin mics >/=16 mcg/ml) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin mics >/=32 mcg/ml and gentamicin mics >/=8 mcg/ml). conclusions: bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by p. aeruginosa. however, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are  recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-p. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.

TI  == remarkable substituent effects on antimicrobial activities of 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium salts.
AB  == in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: escherichia coli (atcc 25922), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 12228), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), enterobacter cloacae (atcc 13047), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) and candida albicans (atcc 10239). selective  and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (p. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (e. faecalis and s. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. the enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction  of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.

TI  == emerging fluoroquinolone-resistance for common clinically important gram-negative bacteria in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. collected from a major teaching hospital in taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. the overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. isolates of escherichia coli and morganella morganii  proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. by 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. activity against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. interestingly, some strains of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in taiwan. this resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of s. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. after the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the p. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was  not due to the spread of a single clone. we conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in taiwan, especially in recent years. appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.

TI  == emerging carbapenemases in gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == carbapenemases may be defined as beta-lactamases that significantly hydrolyze at  least imipenem or/and meropenem. carbapenemases involved in acquired resistance are of ambler molecular classes a, b, and d. class a, clavulanic acid-inhibited carbapenemases are rare. they are either chromosomally encoded (nmc-a, sme-1 to sme-3, imi-1) in enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, or plasmid encoded, such as kpc-1 in klebsiella pneumoniae and ges-2 in pseudomonas aeruginosa, the latter being a point-mutant of the clavulanic acid-inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ges-1. the class b enzymes are the most clinically significant carbapenemases. they are metalloenzymes of the imp or vim  series. they have been reported worldwide but mostly from south east asia and europe. metalloenzymes, whose genes are plasmid and integron located, hydrolyze virtually all beta-lactams except aztreonam. finally, the class d carbapenemases  are increasingly reported in acinetobacter baumannii but compromise imipenem and  meropenem susceptibility only marginally. the sources of the acquired carbapenemase genes remain unknown, as does the relative importance of the spread of epidemic strains as opposed to the spread of plasmid- or integron-borne genes. because most of these carbapenemases confer only reduced susceptibility to carbapenems in enterobacteriaceae, they may remain underestimated as a consequence of the lack of their detection.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == clinafloxacin versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of severe skin and  soft-tissue infections in adults at a veterans affairs medical center.
AB  == background: severe skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis), particularly diabetic foot infections, are a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. inappropriate antimicrobial therapy may contribute to the increasing emergence of bacterial resistance, as well as to increased health care costs. thus, there is a continuing search for reasonably safe, well-tolerated, and effective antimicrobial agents that are less susceptible to the development of resistance than older agents. objective: the department of veterans affairs (va) medical center in nashville, tennessee, was i site in a multicenter, phase iii, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of clinafloxacin with those of piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of adult  patients with ssti. methods: over an 18-month period, patients aged > or = 18 years with physical findings of acute bacterial ssti requiring hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clinafloxacin 200 mg iv every 12 hours or piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g  iv every 6 hours. after a minimum of 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral therapy with clinafloxacin 200 mg po every 12 hours or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg po every 8 hours could be made in the respective treatment groups. results: the center enrolled 84 patients (42 in each group), all but i of whom were male, reflecting the typical va medical center population. the mean age was 60 years (range, 36-80 years) in the clinafloxacin group and 65  years (range, 35-87) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the latter group was significantly older (p = 0.0482), which could have affected recovery rates. sixty-six patients were white and 18 were black. the mean ( +/- sd) duration of treatment was 10.69 +/- 5.34 days in the clinafloxacin group and 12.07 +/- 5.06 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the mean length of stay was 10.83 +/-  10.28 days and 14.95 +/- 19.20 days, respectively. fifty-three (63%) patients were switched to oral therapy (21 in the clinafloxacin group, 32 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). the most commonly isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. clinical cure rates and microbiologic eradication rates were similar between the 2 treatments. the piperacillin/ tazobactam arm experienced more all-cause adverse events than the clinafloxacin arm, although the difference was not statistically significant. the clinafloxacin arm experienced significantly more adverse events (eg, photosensitivity) that were judged by the investigator to be drug related (p = 0.034). conclusions: in this study population of hospitalized adults, clinafloxacin was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of complicated sstis. appropriate precautions must be taken against exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light in patients receiving clinafloxacin, and adequate monitoring is necessary. further investigation is necessary into how the phototoxic effects of the flu oroquinolones can be limited.

AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities among clinical isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria in a taiwanese university hospital.
AB  == infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with resistance to extended-spectrum  cephalosporins require the identification of effective alternative antimicrobial  therapy. to determine the role of other pre-existing or currently available antimicrobial agents in treating infections caused by these multidrug-resistant pathogens, we evaluated the in vitro susceptibilities of these agents in 411 non-duplicate isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria recovered between january 1999 and december 1999 in a major teaching hospital in taipei, taiwan. these isolates included cefotaxime-resistant (mics >  or = 2 mg/l) escherichia coli (66 isolates) and klebsiella pneumoniae (77 isolates); cefotaxime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) enterobacter cloacae (59 isolates), serratia marcescens (52 isolates) and citrobacter freundii (52 isolates); and ceftazidime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) pseudomonas aeruginosa (50 isolates) and acinetobacter baumannii (55 isolates). overall, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) had good activity against the cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae tested (>90% of isolates were susceptible). however, carbapenems had limited activity against the ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa  (only 4% of isolates were susceptible) and a. baumannii (51-56% of isolates were  susceptible). among the e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates tested, 33.3% and 58.4%, respectively, exhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, determined by the double disc method. over 80% of cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae and c. freundii were susceptible to cefepime, but this agent had limited activity against other bacteria tested. susceptibilities of these isolates to ciprofloxacin varied, ranging from 25% for a. baumannii to 92% for e. cloacae. newer fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) had equal or less activity against these organisms, except for a. baumannii for which their mic(90)s (8-16 mg/l) were four- to 16-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin (mic(90) 128 mg/l).

TI  == antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of the diploid frog, xenopus tropicalis (pipidae).
AB  == seven peptides (xt-1-xt-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, xenopus tropicalis. structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. peptides xt-5 and xt-3 are probably the orthologs of x. laevis  peptide glycine-leucine amide (pgl(a)) and the n-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. xt-1, xt-6 and xt-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of x. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs xt-2 and xt-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. orthologs of the magainins were not identified. the c-terminally alpha-amidated peptide xt-7 (gllgpllkiaakvgsnll.nh2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus 5 microm, escherichia coli 5 microm, and candida albicans 40 microm) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus group c, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. the peptide was, however, hemolytic against  human erythrocytes (50% lysis at 70 microm). circular dichroism studies showed that xt-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, ph 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. decreasing the cationicity of xt-7 either by replacement of the c-terminal conh2 group by cooh or by deletion of the lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly (>10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == blood components influence cytokine induction by bacterial substances.
AB  == while some studies clearly demonstrated transfer of cytokine-inducing substances  (cis) through dialysis membranes, other authors were unable to reproduce such a transfer. this inconsistency may have been caused by marked differences in experimental design. we performed a systematic evaluation of cytokine induction in whole blood and from separated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) using either purified lipopolysaccharide (lps) or culture supernatants from various bacterial strains. an in vitro hemodialysis circuit with whole blood in the blood compartment was employed; the dialysate was contaminated with sterile filtrates from pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures. addition of plasma samples from the blood side to pbmc readily induced interleukin (il)-1beta and il-6 after contamination  of the dialysate, while the same samples failed to induce cytokine production in  whole blood. in experiments using direct incubation, purified p. aeruginosa lps induced more il-1beta and il-6 in whole blood compared to pbmc. in contrast, bacterial filtrates from escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and especially p. aeruginosa induced significantly less cytokines in whole blood compared to pbmc.  addition of erythrocytes but not granulocytes decreased cytokine induction by bacterial filtrates as well as by lps, probably by adsorption of these substances. the addition of 30% plasma increased cytokine induction by lps but decreased cytokine induction by p. aeruginosas filtrates. our results suggest that cellular and plasmatic components of whole blood interact with bacterial cis altering their pyrogenic activity. the detection of cis depends on the test system used; whole blood cultures are not as sensitive for the detection of cis from bacterial filtrates as pbmc cultures.

TI  == bacterial cholangitis in patients with biliary atresia: impact on short-term outcome.
AB  == bacterial cholangitis (bc) is a common complication in patients with biliary atresia (ba) and is characterized by fever, acholic stools and positive blood cultures. the diagnosis is often empirical because the yield of blood cultures is low. it is difficult to differentiate bc from other febrile episodes. in order to characterize the clinical and laboratory features of bc in patients with ba, identify risk factors, and correlate cholangitis with outcome, 37 patients with ba from 1993 to 1998 who underwent a kasai operation in our hospital were studied. the follow-up period ranged from 6 to 59 months. a total of 107 febrile  episodes were documented in these patients. the diagnostic criteria for cholangitis were fever, increased jaundice, or acholic stools. the clinical features, laboratory data, results of bacterial cultures, and outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. a total of 107 febrile episodes, including 78 bouts of  cholangitis and 29 non-cholangitis infections, were found in 34 patients. patients with bc had higher postoperative bilirubin levels (p = 0.02) and less frequent use of prophylactic antibiotics (p = 0.05) than those with non-cholangitis infections. abnormal white blood cell counts (> 12,000 or <4,000  mm3) tended to be present in patients with bc (p = 0.08). there were no statistical differences in the risk factors and laboratory data between culture-positive (n = 16) and -negative (n = 62) cholangitis cases. the occurrence of cholangitis significantly reduced survival in both patients with good (p = 0.03) and inadequate bile flow (p = 0.03). all 9 patients who had never had cholangitis survived during the follow-up period. repeated attacks of bc further decreased survival probability. the responsive organisms were mainly enteric bacteria, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanni, and salmonella typhi. the sensitivity tests justified empirical therapy with ceftriaxone. the effectiveness of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or neomycin warrants  further studies. bc was a highly prevalent postoperative complication in patients with ba, especially those with inadequate bile drainage. it significantly affected early mortality. aggressive and complete treatment with empirical ceftriaxone was appropriate.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of argon fluoride (arf) excimer laser on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of argon fluoride (arf) excimer laser radiation on clinically important strains of gram-negative bacteria. the antibacterial activity of arf excimer laser radiation was evaluated on two acinetobacter baumannii, one enterobacter cloacae, three escherichia coli, two helicobacter pylori, one klebsiella pneumoniae and two pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens and typed by the usual biochemical procedures. square agar plates of 12 x 12 cm were divided into rectangular (2 x 3 cm) regions and spread with 0.5x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu)/ml of bacterial suspension. the excess liquid was removed and the plates were allowed to dry for 30 min. a total of 96 rectangular  (2x3 cm) regions were used for each strain, in order to test an equal number of laser parameters. each rectangular region was irradiated with different laser parameters, using a 193 nm arf excimer laser, linked with a simple galilean afocal system and a rectangular diaphragm of the same dimensions as the original  laser beam cross-section, at a distance of 10 cm from the irradiated surface. this system was used in order to keep the laser pulse energy under 80 mj and to cut-out the non-transverse electromagnetic mode branches of the laser beam. we then studied the bacterial survival ratio versus the number of laser pulses, the  repetition frequency and the total laser beam fluence. our results showed that the total laser beam fluence was the most important parameter to consider in evaluating the bactericidal effect of arf excimer laser radiation. a critical value of the total fluence was determined for each strain, such that, for laser beam fluences greater than this critical value, no colonies appeared to survive while, for laser fluences less than this critical value, the survival ratio did not exceed 2 x 10(7) cfu (2 x 10(-5)%). these critical values were found to vary  between 8 j/cm2 and 16 j/cm2 for the bacterial species studied. under these conditions, arf laser irradiation is promising for the sterilisation of hard surfaces and for in situ application.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == interaction of bladder glycoprotein gp51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: a major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein gp51 (molecular weight 51 kd.). gp51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. gp51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). increased urinary gp51 occurs during urinary tract infection. to elucidate the role of gp51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. materials and methods: elisa was performed to demonstrate the binding of gp51 and various uropathogens. immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to gp51 to determine the interaction of gp51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize gp51. antigen inhibition elisa was done to quantitate urinary gp51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. results: elisa revealed that gp51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. immunochemical methods confirmed that purified gp51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. clinical specimens showed gp51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial  cells. we observed a significant increase in urinary gp51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). conclusions: these studies suggest that gp51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.

TI  == phenotypic resistance of staphylococcus aureus, selected enterobacteriaceae, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa after single and multiple in vitro exposures to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin.
AB  == the phenotypic resistance of selected organisms to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin was defined as a mic of > or =4 microg/ml. the dynamics of resistance were studied after single and sequential drug exposures: clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa), escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were utilized. after a single 48-h exposure of a large inoculum to four times the initial mic for the organism, the frequency of selection of resistant mutants of mssa was greater for trovafloxacin than levofloxacin (p = 0.008); for e. cloacae, the frequency was highest for ciprofloxacin and lowest for levofloxacin and trovafloxacin; for s. marcescens, the frequency was highest for trovafloxacin and lowest for ciprofloxacin (p = 0.003). the results of serial passage experiments were analyzed both by the kaplan-meier product-limited method as well as by analysis of variance of mean inhibitory values. by both methods, mssa and mrsa expressed mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin after fewer passages than were required for either levofloxacin or trovafloxacin. for the aerobic gram-negative bacilli, two  general patterns emerged. mutants resistant to trovafloxacin appeared sooner and  reached higher mean mics than did mutants resistant to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin appeared later and reached mean mics lower than the mics of the other two drugs studied. even though individual strain variation occurred, the mean mics were reproduced when the serial passage  experiment was repeated using an identical panel of e. coli isolates. in summary, the dynamic selection of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria can be demonstrated in experiments that employ serial passage of bacteria in vitro.

TI  == isolation and identification of bacteria associated with adult laboratory mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae).
AB  == from the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, vibrionaceae, micrococcaceae, deinococcacea, bacillaceae, and the genus listeria. enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with citrobacter, streptococcus, aerococcus, and listeria found less frequently. we found bacillus cereus, enterobacter sakazakii, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. we also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, e. sakazakii, k. pneumoniae spp., providencia rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus. isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.

TI  == antimicrobial properties and mode of action of the pyrrothine holomycin.
AB  == holomycin, a member of the pyrrothine class of antibiotics, displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, inhibiting a variety of gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the antibiotic lacked activity against the  eukaryotic microorganisms saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida kefyr. holomycin exhibited a bacteriostatic response against escherichia coli that was associated  with rapid inhibition of rna synthesis in whole cells. inhibition of rna synthesis could have been a secondary consequence of inhibiting trna aminoacylation, thereby inducing the stringent response. however, the levels of inhibition of rna synthesis by holomycin were similar in a stringent and relaxed  pair of e. coli strains that were isogenic except for the deletion of the rela gene. this suggests that inhibition of rna synthesis by holomycin could reflect direct inhibition of dna-dependent rna polymerase. examination of the effects of  holomycin on the kinetics of the appearance of beta-galactosidase in induced e. coli cells was also consistent with inhibition of rna polymerase at the level of  rna chain elongation. however, holomycin only weakly inhibited e. coli rna polymerase in assays using synthetic poly(da-dt) and plasmid templates. furthermore, inhibition of rna polymerase was observed only at holomycin concentrations in excess of those required to inhibit the growth of e. coli. it is possible that holomycin is a prodrug, requiring conversion in the cell to an active species that inhibits rna polymerase.

AB  == immune inhibitors produced in infected larvae of galleria mellonella by such entomopathogens as pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and heterorhabditis bacteriophora effectively blocked in vitro bactericidal activity  of insect haemolymph against escherichia coli d31, both in galleria mellonella and pieris brassicae pupae previously vaccinated with enterobacter cloacae. even  at a trace concentration, the extracellular proteinases, by proteolytic degradation, totally destroyed the activity of cecropin peptides from galleria and cecropin-like and attacin-family proteins from pieris, but no ability to destroy antibacterial activity was shown by extracts obtained from galleria larvae killed by massive doses of bacterial saprophytes. it is suggested that by  blocking antibacterial immune response of the host, the proteinases help the bacteria to multiply in the haemolymph, thus they could be considered an important factor in the pathogenesis of bacterial diseases of insects.

TI  == influence of an infectious disease service on antibiotic prescription behavior and selection of multiresistant pathogens.
AB  == background: a routine infectious disease service was established in january 1998  in order to optimize the antibiotic usage and prescription pattern of a neurologic intensive care unit (nicu). methods: treatment guidelines for the most prevalent infections were implemented and individual antibiotic regimes were discussed at the bedside with infectious disease experts. results: this interdisciplinary cooperation reduced the total number of antibiotics prescribed  by 38.1%, from 7,789 in 1997 to 4,822 in 1998, without compromising patient outcomes (mortality rate: 22/313 patients in 1997 vs. 32/328 patients in 1998). total patient days (2,254 days vs. 2,296 days) and average length of stay in the  nicu (7.2 days vs. 7.0 days) were comparable. antimicrobial expenditure decreased by 44.8% (71,680 euros in 1997 vs 39,567 euros in 1998). taking into account the  costs for the infectious disease service (approximately 8,000 euros in 1998), a total saving of 24,113 euros was made. the dramatic reduction in antibiotic usage (mainly of carbapenems) resulted in a statistically significant decreased isolation of stenotrophomonas maltophilia (p<0.05), enterobacter cloacae (p<0.05), multiresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (p<0.05) and candida spp. (p<0.05), without any change in the infection control guidelines. conclusion: these data show that an infectious disease service can optimize and reduce antibiotic usage. this results in a decrease in the occurence of multiresistant gram-negative pathogens and candida spp. in intensive care units and, at the same time, saves costs.

TI  == evaluation of current activities of fluoroquinolones against gram-negative bacilli using centralized in vitro testing and electronic surveillance.
AB  == given the propensity for enterobacteriaceae and clinically significant nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli to acquire antimicrobial resistance, consistent surveillance of the activities of agents commonly prescribed to treat  infections arising from these organisms is imperative. this study determined the  activities of two fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and seven comparative agents against recent clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia using two surveillance strategies: 1) centralized in vitro susceptibility testing of isolates collected from 27 hospital laboratories across the united states and  2) analysis of data from the surveillance network database-usa, an electronic surveillance network comprising more than 200 laboratories nationwide. regardless of the surveillance method, enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and a. baumannii demonstrated similar rates of susceptibility to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. susceptibilities to the fluoroquinolones approached or exceeded 90% for all enterobacteriaceae except providencia spp. (</=65%). approximately 70% of p. aeruginosa and 50% of a. baumanii isolates were susceptible to both fluoroquinolones. among s. maltophilia isolates, 50% more isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. overall, the rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility among enterobacteriaceae was 8.7%, with fluoroquinolone resistance rates notably higher among ceftazidime-nonsusceptible  isolates than ceftazidime-susceptible ones. multidrug-resistant isolates were present among all species tested but were most prevalent for klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. no gram-negative isolates resistant only to  a fluoroquinolone were encountered, regardless of species. thus, while levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have maintained potent activity against enterobacteriaceae, the potential for fluoroquinolone resistance, the apparent association between fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance, and the presence of multidrug resistance in every species examined emphasize the need to  maintain active surveillance of resistance patterns among gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == target site concentrations after continuous infusion and bolus injection of cefpirome to healthy volunteers.
AB  == background: recent data indicate a higher level of effectivity of beta-lactam antibiotics if serum concentrations are kept above the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the pathogen. this concept would favor continuous infusion over bolus dosing. however, it is usually not the serum concentration but the free interstitial concentration in the target tissue that determines antibiotic activity. we therefore set out to measure effective drug concentrations in the interstitial space of muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue and to compare trough levels and times above the mic after bolus versus continuous infusion of cefpirome. methods: twelve healthy volunteers received a single dose of 2 g cefpirome as an intravenous bolus or as a continuous infusion over 8 hours in a crossover design, and the resulting free interstitial tissue concentrations were  measured with use of microdialysis. results: after bolus injection, mean interstitial trough concentrations were 3.0 +/- 1.9 microg/ml and 2.1 +/-1.0 microg/ml for muscle and subcutaneous tissue, respectively; continuous infusion resulted in trough levels of 10.1 +/- 6.8 microg/ml and 10.1 +/- 4.6 microg/ml for muscle and subcutaneous tissue, respectively. this resulted in significantly  longer times above the mic with continuous infusion for staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter cloacae. bacteria with an mic < or =1 would be covered by either method, whereas higher doses seem to be necessary for pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: although susceptible organisms will usually be covered sufficiently with standard dosing regimens, soft tissue infections with bacteria that have mic values of 2 to 8 may profit from continuous application. coverage of p aeruginosa, however, would be inadequate with conventional daily doses of 4 g cefpirome regardless of the method of application.

TI  == three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in argentina. the antimicrobial committee; and the national surveillance program (sir) participants group.
AB  == introduction: a national surveillance program (sir) was introduced in 1996 in argentina by the antimicrobial committee of the argentinean society for microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. the present study reports the rates  of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. methods: a 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., april-may and october-november) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 argentinean centers. susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: in all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), respectively. although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the s. aureus and cns strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. no ampicillin resistance  was displayed by enterococcus faecalis. high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). imipenem resistance in acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. among  enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the e. cloacae strains. resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli isolates, respectively. conclusions: the alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in argentina.

TI  == antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of feijoa sellowiana fruit.
AB  == the present study was designed to evaluate the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of an aqueous extract from the tropical feijoa sellowiana berg. fruit  which is widely used for human food. the extract was tested against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by a broth dilution test and on human whole blood leukocytes, as well as isolated neutrophils using a chemiluminescence (cl) assay. the extract inhibited bacterial growth; pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae were the most sensitive. the fruit extract significantly decreased cl emission from human whole blood phagocytes and isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes whether they were activated or not by soluble or phagocytic stimuli. f. sellowiana showed both antibacterial and antioxidant properties and therefore its extract might be used as a new multifaceted drug.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == [in vitro activity of biapenem (bipm) against clinically isolated respiratory pathogens in 1996-1998].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of biapenem (bipm), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was compared with those of imipenem (ipm), panipenem (papm), meropenem (mepm), ceftazidime (caz) and piperacillin (pipc) against 280 isolates  of 9 respiratory pathogens. the mic90s of biapenem (bipm) for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae were 0.12, 32, 0.25, 0.06, 4 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. in comparison with other antibiotics, the activity of biapenem (bipm) for p. aeruginosa was as potent as meropenem (mepm),  but for h. influenzae it was slightly less than those of other antibiotics, and for other respiratory pathogens it was as potent as those of other antibiotics. the mic90s of biapenem (bipm) for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were 0.06, 1, 1, 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively, and which were equal to or somewhat lower than those of other antibiotics. biapenem (bipm) showed strong activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, especially p. aeruginosa in general. based on these results, biapenem (bipm) is seemed to be highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections with several organism.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cefepime administered by intermittent and continuous infusion.
AB  == objective: this study assessed the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cefepime administered by intermittent and continuous infusion against clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and staphylococcus aureus. background: because beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit time-dependent bactericidal activity and lack prolonged postantibiotic effects against many bacteria, the goal of therapy is to maintain serum drug concentrations above the  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for the relevant pathogen over most of the dosing interval. continuous infusion is a mode of drug administration that can provide serum drug concentrations continuously above the mic for most bacterial pathogens. methods: twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled. each received cefepime 2 g by intermittent bolus q12h and, on another day, was randomly assigned to receive 4 or 3 g administered by continuous infusion over 24 hours. results: for the intermittent regimen, the mean (+/- sd) pharmacokinetic findings were: maximum serum concentration, 112.9 +/- 21.1 microg/ml; minimum serum concentration, 1.3 +/- 0.5 microg/ml; and half-life, 2.6 +/- 0.4 hours. for the 3- and 4-g continuous infusion regimens, steady-state serum concentrations (c(ss)) were 13.9 +/- 3.8 and 20.3 +/- 3.3 microg/ml, respectively. mics ranged from 2 to 4, 0.125 to 8, and 2 to 8 microg/ml against p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae,  and s. aureus, respectively. for the intermittent regimen, serum inhibitory titers (sits) at 24 hours were > or = 1:2 in 46% of subjects against p. aeruginosa, 48% against e. cloacae, and 2% against s. aureus. for both continuous infusion regimens, sits for each organism were > or = 1:2 in all subjects. conclusions: the intermittent regimen maintained serum concentrations above the mic for p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae in > or = 92% (11/12) of subjects for > or = 70% of the dosing interval, provided the mic was < or = 4 microg/ml. both continuous infusion regimens provided a c(ss) above the mic for all organisms. however, the c(ss) was > or = 4 times the mic only if the mic was < or = 2 microg/ml. only the 4-g regimen provided such concentrations against isolates with an mic of 4 microg/ml, and neither regimen provided such concentrations when the mic was 8 microg/ml. these findings should be applied in comparative clinical studies.

TI  == association of qace and qacedelta1 with multiple resistance to antibiotics and antiseptics in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were tested for resistance to antibiotics and to the antiseptics benzalkonium chloride and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. furthermore, they were examined for the presence  of the resistance genes qace and qacedelta1. qacedelta1 was detected by pcr in 10% of all (n=103) and in 81% of multiply antibiotic-resistant strains (n=15). qace was found in only one of 37 p. aeruginosa strains. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of benzalkonium chloride, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and ethidium bromide were not significantly different for qacedelta1/qace-positive or -negative strains. our data indicate that multiply antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria are not necessarily more resistant to quaternary ammonium  compounds than antibiotic-sensitive strains even though qace or qacedelta1 is present.

TI  == surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, 1998.
AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

TI  == convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  == a simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of imp-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. two kirby-bauer disks containing ceftazidime (caz) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. several imp-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and edta were evaluated for this test. two caz disks were placed on a mueller-hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of  the caz disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. for imp-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was  observed for caz-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as ampc  or shv-12. as a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block imp-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and caz-resistant strains producing ampc or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from imp-1 producers by this test. a similar observation was made with imp-1-producing clinical isolates  such as serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter spp., and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. the specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of pcr analysis using bla(imp)-specific primers. therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.

TI  == comparison of five beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial pathogens using the time above mic at different creatinine clearances.
AB  == study objective: to compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (clcr). interventions: serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. the mic data for 90% of organisms (mic90) were collected for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean mic90 was calculated. the t>mic was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean mic90. a t>mic of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except s. aureus (> or = 50%). measurements and main results: cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for all enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus at every clcr. imipenem  0.5 g achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, and s. aureus at every clcr. however, imipenem t>mic was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: s. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 90 ml/min), e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 80 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (clcr > or = 100 ml/min), s. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), e. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 60-70 ml/min), and e. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (clcr 50-70 ml/min). ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours  (clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable t>mic for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus only. at every dose and clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable t>mic for s. aureus but  not for any enterobacteriaceae at clcr > 50 ml/minute. piperacillin did not achieve desirable t>mic for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a t>mic of 70% or above for p. aeruginosa at any clcr. conclusion: at every clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable t>mic for more nosocomial pathogens than any other  beta-lactam evaluated. based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate  empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. however, when p. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adult post-neurosurgical patients.
AB  == background: to assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) in adult postneurosurgical patients. methods: thirty adult patients with gnbm were included in this study. their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. the patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. seven  had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. two patients  were associated with brain abscess. results: the pathogens found in the 30 gnbm patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. among these 30  patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gnbm were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. all eight died. the mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. conclusions: there has been an increase of gnbm  in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. in addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic  challenge. we noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients  with nosocomially acquired gnbm, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.

TI  == the complexed structure and antimicrobial activity of a non-beta-lactam inhibitor of ampc beta-lactamase.
AB  == beta-lactamases are the major resistance mechanism to beta-lactam antibiotics and pose a growing threat to public health. recently, bacteria have become resistant  to beta-lactamase inhibitors, making this problem pressing. in an effort to overcome this resistance, non-beta-lactam inhibitors of beta-lactamases were investigated for complementarity to the structure of ampc beta-lactamase from escherichia coli. this led to the discovery of an inhibitor, benzo(b)thiophene-2-boronic acid (bzbth2b), which inhibited ampc with a ki of 27  nm. this inhibitor is chemically dissimilar to beta-lactams, raising the question of what specific interactions are responsible for its activity. to answer this question, the x-ray crystallographic structure of bzbth2b in complex with ampc was determined to 2.25 a resolution. the structure reveals several unexpected interactions. the inhibitor appears to complement the conserved, r1-amide binding region of ampc, despite lacking an amide group. interactions between one of the boronic acid oxygen atoms, tyr150, and an ordered water molecule suggest a mechanism for acid/base catalysis and a direction for hydrolytic attack in the enzyme catalyzed reaction. to investigate how a non-beta-lactam inhibitor would perform against resistant bacteria, bzbth2b was tested in antimicrobial assays. bzbth2b significantly potentiated the activity of a third-generation cephalosporin against ampc-producing resistant bacteria. this inhibitor was unaffected by two common resistance mechanisms that often arise against beta-lactams in conjunction with beta-lactamases. porin channel mutations did not decrease the efficacy of bzbth2b against cells expressing ampc. also, this inhibitor did not induce expression of ampc, a problem with many beta-lactams. the structure of the bzbth2b/ampc complex provides a starting point for the structure-based elaboration of this class of non-beta-lactam inhibitors.

TI  == characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in north america: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program evaluates  international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. we describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from utis during the third-quarter of 1997 in north america (united states and canada), as part of this worldwide program. the isolates were  tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and automated ribotyping. the five most frequently isolated species were escherichia coli (48.6%), enterococcus spp. (13.7%), klebsiella spp. (12.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and enterobacter spp. or  proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). for each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. for gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against e. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the usa were vancomycin-resistant (88% with van a). p. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem  (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). e. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), k. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (amp c) stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). these data demonstrated that several uti isolates in  sentry hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.

AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == development of bacterial resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and their clinical use.
AB  == development of gram-negative rods resistance to the third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone) in connection with their application at the university hospital in olomouc was evaluated in this study. the highest increase in resistance to cefotaxime was detected in enterobacter cloacae (from 22.9% in 1995 to 49.0% in 1997) and enterobacter agglomerans strains (28.0% - 40.5%). in addition, increased resistance to ceftazidime in acinetobacter baumannii (12.5% - 35.1%), enterobacter aerogenes (7.4% - 20.9%), enterobacter cloacae (16.7% - 47.2%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0% - 26.3%) was observed. finally, the greatest increase in frequency of strains resistant to cefoperazone was observed in e. aerogenes (18.4% - 30.1%), e. agglomerans (31.0%  - 52.3%), e. cloacae (35.5% - 47.2%) and providencia rettgeri (26.5% - 53.2%). a  23.5% increase in third generation cephalosporin use was evident by evaluation of rddd(atb) parameters in 1996 and 1997. corresponding values for individual antibiotics were 26.5% cefotaxime, 20.7% ceftriaxone, and 40.3% ceftazidime increase. however, cefoperazone use decreased by 10.9%.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of syn2190, a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  == syn2190, a monobactam derivative containing 1,5-dihydroxy-4-pyridone as the c-3 side chain, is a potent inhibitor of group 1 beta-lactamase. the concentrations of inhibitor needed to reduce the initial rate of hydrolysis of substrate by 50%  for syn2190 against these enzymes were in the range of 0.002 to 0.01 microm. these values were 220- to 850-fold lower than those of tazobactam. syn2190 showed in vitro synergy with ceftazidime and cefpirome. this synergy was dependent on the concentration of the inhibitor against group 1 beta-lactamase-producing strains, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and morganella morganii. however, against beta-lactamase-derepressed mutants of p. aeruginosa, the mics of ceftazidime plus syn2190 were not affected  by the amount of beta-lactamase, and the values were the same for the parent strains. the mics at which 50% of isolates are inhibited (mic(50)s) of ceftazidime plus syn2190 were 2- to 16-fold lower than those of ceftazidime alone for ceftazidime-resistant, clinically isolated gram-negative bacteria. similarly, the mic(50)s of cefpirome plus syn2190 were two- to eightfold lower for cefpirome-resistant clinical isolates. the synergies of syn2190 plus ceftazidime  or cefpirome observed in vitro were also reflected in vivo. syn2190 improved the  efficacies of both cephalosporins in both a murine systemic infection model with  cephalosporin-resistant rods and urinary tract infection models with cephalosporin-resistant p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == [survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  == research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. the activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. the broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between october and  december 1996. the results were as follows: carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against mssa and streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against mrsa. their activities against enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. the carbapenems showed high activities against haemophilis influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae. enterobacter cloacae. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group. their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of serratia marcescens were detected. the antibacterial activity of carbapenems against pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of caz, and there were some resistant strains.

TI  == in vitro activity of clinafloxacin against fluoroquinolone resistant spanish clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of clinafloxacin against 162 ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates was determined. isolates were selected when their mic to ciprofloxacin was 2 mg/l (intermediate) or > 2 mg/l (resistant). the following strains were tested: 61 escherichia coli, 12 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 proteus mirabilis, 21 serratia marcescens, 4 enterobacter cloacae, 21 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21 staphylococcus. aureus (resistant to methicillin) and 15 enterococcus spp. clinafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin activities were evaluated by agar dilution using mueller-hinton agar according to nccls recommendations. of the 162 isolates, 16 (9.8%) were intermediate and 146 (90.1%) resistant to ciprofloxacin. 95 of the 162 strains (58.6%) were susceptible, 27 (16.7%) intermediately susceptible, and 40 strains (24.7%) were resistant to clinafloxacin. the percentage susceptible to clinafloxacin was 65.6% for e. coli, 75% for k. pneumoniae, 71.4% for p. mirabilis, 28.6% for s. marcescens, 75% for e. cloacae, 33.3% for p. aeruginosa, 90.5% for s. aureus and  40% for enterococcus spp. clinafloxacin was active against 58.6% of the ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates tested. it was particularly active against s. aureus strains resistant to both ciprofloxacin and methicillin.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of six broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents tested against over 2,000 clinical isolates from 22 medical  centers in japan. japan antimicrobial resistance study group.
AB  == numerous broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents have been introduced into medical practice since 1985. although several of these compounds have advanced, infectious disease therapy resistances to them has also emerged world-wide. in 1997, a japanese 22 medical center investigation was initiated to  assess the continued utility of these agents (oxacillin or piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, cefoperazone/sulbactam [c/s], imipenem). the participating medical centers represented a wide geographic distribution, and a common protocol and reagents were applied. three control strains and a set of challenge organisms were provided to participant centers. etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) strips were used in concurrent tests of these organisms and a qualitative determination of participant skills in the identification of resistant and susceptible phenotypes was established. the quantitative controls demonstrated 97.7-99.2% of mic values within established qc limits, and the qualitative (susceptibility category) controls documented a 97.3% agreement of participant results with that of reference values (1,320 total results). only 0.2% of values were false-susceptible errors. after the participant quality was assured, a total of 2,015 clinical strains were tested (10 strains from 10 different organism groups including methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci [cons], escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., indole-positive proteae, serratia spp.,  acinetobacter spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the staphylococci were uniformly susceptible to all drugs tested except ceftazidime (mic90, 24 micrograms/ml) that had a potency six- to 12-fold less than either cefepime or cefpirome. only 3.7 and 45.1% of s. aureus and cons were susceptible to ceftazidime, respectively. among e. coli and klebsiella spp. the rank order of antimicrobial spectrum was imipenem = "fourth-generation" cephalosporins > ceftazidime > c/s > piperacillin. possible extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes were identified in 2.9-8.6%  of these isolates. isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter spp., proteae, and serratia spp. that were resistant to ceftazidime and piperacillin remained susceptible to imipenem (0.0-4.5% resistance) and cefepime (0.0-5.0%). acinetobacters were inhibited best by c/s (99.5% susceptible) and least susceptible to piperacillin (mic90, > 256 micrograms/ml; 21.7% susceptible) activity. p. aeruginosa isolates were most susceptible to cefepime (83.6%) and this zwitterionic cephalosporin also had the lowest level of resistance (9.1% of  mics at > or = 32 micrograms/ml). several multi-resistant organisms were identified in participant medical centers including s. marcescens strains resistant to cefepime, imipenem, or both observed in six hospitals. clonal spread was documented in two medical centers; one hospital having two distinct epidemic  clusters. also a multi-resistant e. cloacae was found in two patients in the same hospital. evaluations of carbapenem resistance in four species discovered only two strains (in same hospital) among 40 p. aeruginosa isolates (5.0%) with a metallo-enzyme, with nearly all of the remaining strains inhibited by an ambler class c enzyme inhibitor (brl42715) indicating a hyperproduction of a chromosomal cephalosporinase. these results indicate that most newer beta-lactams remain widely useable in medical centers in japan, but emerging often clonal, resistances have occurred. the overall rank order of antimicrobial spectrum against all ten tested bacterial groups favors the "fourth-generation" cephalosporin, cefepime (96.4% susceptible) as an equal to imipenem (95.9%) > c/s (90.9%) = cefpirome (90.0%) > ceftazidime (75.1%) = penicillins, either oxacillin or piperacillin (76.4%).

TI  == pulmonary infiltrates in liver transplant recipients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == background: a frequent dilemma is discerning the likelihood of pneumonia and the  need for empiric antibiotic therapy in liver transplant recipients with pulmonary infiltrates in the intensive care unit (icu). methods: we performed a prospective, observational study of consecutive liver transplant recipients developing pulmonary infiltrates in the icu. results: of 90 consecutive liver transplant patients in the icu over a 3-year period, 44% (40) developed pulmonary infiltrates. the etiologies were pneumonia (38%, 15 of 40), pulmonary edema (40%, 16 of 40), atelectasis (10%, 4 of 40), adult respiratory distress syndrome (8%, 3 of 40), contusion (3%, 1 of 40), and unknown (3%, 1 of 40). pneumonia was due to  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 27% (4 of 15), pseudomonas aeruginosa (27%, 4 of 15), invasive aspergillosis (20%, 3 of 15), and enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and unknown (7%, 1 of 15) in one each. none of the patients had cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus pneumonia. seventy-five percent of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and all aspergillus pneumonias, but only 14% of the gram-negative pneumonias, occurred within 30 days of transplantation. twenty-seven percent of the pneumonias occurred >365 days after transplantation;  all of these were in patients with recurrent viral hepatitis c virus or hepatitis b virus, disseminated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, or late rejection. of patients with pneumonia, 87% were ventilated and 40% had bacteremia. clinical pulmonary infection score (pugin score) >6 (73% vs. 6%, p =  0.0001), abnormal temperature (73% versus 28%, p = 0.005), and creatinine level >1.5 mg/dl (80% versus 50%, p = 0.05) were predictors of pneumonia versus other etiologies of pulmonary infiltrates. overall mortality in patients with pulmonary infiltrates was 28% (11 of 40); pneumonia as etiology (p = 0.06), creatinine level >1.5 mg/dl (p = 0.028), higher blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.017), and worse apache neurological score (p = 0.04) were predictors of poor outcome. conclusions: our data have implications not only for identifying pneumonia as a potential cause of pulmonary infiltrates, but for the likely etiology of the pneumonia and thus the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy in critically ill  liver transplant recipients. pugin score >6 in patients with pulmonary infiltrates warrants antimicrobial therapy. early onset within 30 days after transplantation raises the spectra of aspergillosis.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 hospitals during the period of june 1997 to may 1998. of the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) showed the highest activity against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. imipenem (ipm) and vancomycin (vcm) were also active with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm and arbekacin (abk) showed the highest activities against both s. aureus and mrsa isolated from patients with utis. the  mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. the others except minocycline (mino) had low  activities with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. more than a half of s. aureus strains (including mrsa) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (gm) and mino, the mic50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. enterobacter cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. the mic90s of ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and tosufloxacin (tflx) were 1 microgram/ml, the mic90s of amikacin (amk)  and ofloxacin (oflx) were 4 micrograms/ml, the mic90 of gm was 16 micrograms/ml.  among e. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. but the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. escherichia coli all drugs except penicillins were active against e. coli with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. particularly, flomoxef (fmox), cefmenoxime (cmx), cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop), ipm, cpfx and tflx showed the highest activities against e. coli with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to  almost all the drugs except penicillins. carumonam (crmn) had the strongest activity with the mics for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. fmox, cpr, czop, cpfx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. the mic90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. proteus mirabilis almost all the drugs except abpc and mino showed high activities against p. mirabilis. cmx, ceftazidime (caz), latamoxef (lmox), cpr, cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx) and crmn showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis. the mics of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. cpfx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. pseudomonas aeruginosa  the mic90 of gm was 8 micrograms/ml, the mic90s of amk, ipm and meropenem (mepm)  were 16 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active against p. aeruginosa with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. the mic90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. serratia marcescens ipm showed the highest activity against s. marcescens. its mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. gm was also active with the mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. the mic90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. the mic50s of crmn was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the mic50s of cpr and czop were 0.25 microgram/ml.

TI  == bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

AB  == a compost mixture amended with soybean oil was enriched in microorganisms that transformed unsaturated fatty acids (ufas). when oleic acid or 10-ketostearic acid was the selective fatty acid, sphingobacterium thalpophilum (nrrl b-23206, nrrl b-23208, nrrl b-23209, nrrl b-23210, nrrl b-23211, nrrl b-23212), acinetobacter spp. (nrrl b-23207, nrrl b-23213), and enterobacter cloacae (nrrl b-23264, nrrl b-23265, nrrl b-23266) represented isolates that produced either hydroxystearic acid, ketostearic acid, or incomplete decarboxylations. when ricinoleic (12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic) acid was the selective ufa, enterobacter cloacae (nrrl b-23257, nrrl b-23267) and escherichia sp. (nrrl b-23259) produced  12-c and 14-c homologous compounds, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (nrrl b-23256, nrrl b-23260) converted ricinoleate to a trihydroxyoctadecenoate product. also, various enterobacter, pseudomonas, and serratia spp. appeared to decarboxylate linoleate substrate incompletely. these saprophytic, compost bacteria were aerobic or facultative anaerobic gram-negative and decomposed ufas through decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and hydroperoxidation mechanisms.

TI  == bacteriological monitoring in the prague burns center.
AB  == the microbiological aspect of the prevention of nosocomial infections at the burn center consists primarily in the surveillance of bacterial flora and its antibiotical resistance. the prague burn center is regularly monitoring the microbial flora. patients are examined not only by the conventional methods of taking swabs of burned sites, but also by printing method, which allows a semiquantitative assessment of the colonization of burned areas. simultaneously,  investigation of bacterial contamination in the external environment of the department is carried out and the colonization of nursing staff is investigated.  in all isolated strains the sensitivity to antibiotics is examined; this is significant from the point of view of current knowledge about therapeutic possibilities and for the antibiotic policy. the typing of bacterial strains makes possible to determine their epidemiological markers, and thus to investigate their spread within the department. the most frequent isolate is s. aureus and the prevalence of mrsa is relatively high. among gramnegative rods the strains of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae are most often isolated. various typing methods revealed endemic spread of particular strains of rarely isolated species (e. agglomerans, s. marcescens, a. baumannii, etc.).

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == changes in the incidence and etiological patterns of bacteremia associated with acute leukemia over a 25-year period.
AB  == during the 25-year period from 1972-1996, 360 episodes of bacteremia occurred in  248 (45%) of a total of 548 patients with acute leukemia on our hematology ward,  with the rate of occurrence remaining almost unchanged. patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, however, had a significant decrease in the incidence of  bacteremia during the last 5-year period. gram-negative bacilli decreased in relative frequency from 64% for the first 15-year period to 40% for the last 5-year period, whereas gram-positive cocci increased from 24% to 51%. escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae somewhat decreased in frequency, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococci had considerable increases. in  contrast, pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated at a relatively constant frequency, forming one of the top two pathogens throughout the study period. despite the shift toward gram-positive cocci, therefore, p. aeruginosa remains a key organism in considering the initial empiric antibiotic regimen and infection prevention during neutropenia.

AB  == enterobacter cloacae 8009 produced an inducible class a beta-lactamase which hydrolyzed cefotaxime efficiently. it also hydrolyzed other beta-lactams except cephamycins and carbapenems. the activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid and imipenem. the bla gene was transferable to escherichia coli by electroporation of plasmid dna. the molecular mass of the beta-lactamase was 29 kda and its pi was 7.3. all of these phenotypic characteristics of the enzyme except for inducible production resemble those of some extended-spectrum class a beta-lactamases like  fec-1. the gene encoding this beta-lactamase was cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence of the beta-lactamase was homologous to the ampa sequences of the serratia fonticola chromosomal enzyme (96%), men-1 (78%), klebsiella oxytoca chromosomal enzymes (77%), toho-1 (75%), and fec-1 (72%). the  conserved sequences of class a beta-lactamases, including the s-x(t)-x(s)-k motif, in the active site were all conserved in this enzyme. on the basis of the  high degree of homology to the beta-lactamase of s. fonticola, the enzyme was named sfo-1. the ampr gene was located upstream of the ampa gene, and the ampr sequence of sfo-1 had homology with the ampr sequences of the chromosomal beta-lactamases from citrobacter diversus (80%), proteus vulgaris (68%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). sfo-1 was also inducible in e. coli. however, a transformant harboring plasmid without intact ampr produced a small amount of beta-lactamase constitutively, suggesting that ampr works as an activator of ampa of sfo-1. this is the first report from japan describing an inducible plasmid-mediated class a beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa polymicrobial bloodstream infections traced to extrinsic contamination of a dextrose multidose vial.
AB  == objective: to identify risk factors for polymicrobial bloodstream infections (bsis) in neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) patients during an outbreak of bsis. design: during an outbreak of bsis, we conducted a retrospective cohort study, assessed nicu infection control practices and patient exposure to nicu healthcare workers (hcws), and obtained cultures of the environment and hcw hands. patients: during the period may 3 to 7, 1996, 5 infants contracted bsis caused by both enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one infant contracted a bsi caused by e cloacae only. for each pathogen, all isolates were identical on dna typing. results: infants exposed to the following were more likely than nonexposed infants to have bsi: umbilical venous catheters (6/14 vs 0/7, p = .05), total parenteral nutrition given simultaneously with a dextrose/electrolyte solution (6/12 vs 0/9, p = .02), or one hcw (5/7 vs 1/13, p  = .007). neither environmental nor hcw hand cultures yielded the outbreak pathogens. quality control cultures of intravenous solution bags were negative. conclusions: we speculate that a dextrose multidose vial became contaminated during manipulation or needle puncture and that successive use of this contaminated vial for multiple patients may have been responsible for bsis. aseptic techniques must be employed when multidose vial medications are used. single-dose vials should be used for parenteral additives whenever possible to reduce the risk of extrinsic contamination and subsequent transmission of nosocomial pathogens.

AB  == the action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. the samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13%  respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. the gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: escherichia (1,289), pseudomonas (451), proteus (230), klebsiella (203), haemophilus (172), enterobacter (145), acinetobacter (88), salmonella (60), bacteroides (57), morganella (53), serratia (46), citrobacter (46), stenotrophonomas (23) and moraxella (21). the gram-positive bacteria were s. aureus (316), e. faecalis (239), s. epidermis (130), s. pneumoniae (115) and clostridium spp. (12). the global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: e. coli 98%, p. aeruginosa 92%, and p. mirabilis, morganella, k. pneumoniae, serratia and salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. the susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% citrobacter, 77% e. cloacae, 42% a. baumannii, 61% s. maltophilia, 97% e. faecalis, 93% s. epidermidis, 100% m. catarrhalis, 99% h. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria.  the action on s. pneumoniae and s. aureus varied according to the susceptibility  or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. in comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.

TI  == the prognostic factors of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis.
AB  == seventy-seven patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm), 57 males and 20 females, aged 17-86 years, were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital, over an 11-year period. fifty-four infections were community-acquired, and 23 were nosocomial; 49 were spontaneous and 28 occurred after head surgery or neurosurgery. the organisms most frequently involved were klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter. rarer pathogens included citrobacter species, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. all patients who did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy died. the mortality in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 28%. other statistically significant prognostic factors included septic shock, initial level of consciousness, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, high cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and leucocytosis. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only appropriate antimicrobial therapy and septic shock were strongly associated with mortality even after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. despite the high mortality, management can be improved by early diagnosis, early use of appropriate antibiotics, and correction of underlying and associated medical derangement.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature.
AB  == background: the extraordinary growth properties of most microorganisms in 10% and 20% lipid emulsions has led to the centers for disease control and prevention recommendation that if lipids are given through an i.v. line, the administration  set should be replaced every 24 hours rather than the usual 72-hour interval used for crystalloid solutions, including those used for conventional total parenteral nutrition. for nearly 15 years, parenteral alimentation has been given as a total nutrient admixture (tna), with the glucose, amino acids, and lipid mixed within the same bag and infused continuously over 24 hours. methods: we prospectively studied in a representative tna (17.6% glucose, 5% amino acids, 4% lipid; ph 5.6, osmolality 1778) and in a control solution, 5% dextrose-in-water (d5%/w), the growth properties at 4, 25, and 35 degrees c of three isolates each of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, flavobacterium spp, and candida albicans, and two isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, the species that are most likely to contaminate tna during preparation or administration and that have been implicated in >95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections traced to contaminated parenteral admixtures reported in the world literature. results: growth in tna at 25 and 35 degrees c occurred with only two species, c. albicans  and s. saprophyticus, and only after 24 to 48 hours; d5%/w allowed growth at 25 degrees c of two gram-negative species, s. marcescens and b. cepacia. conclusions: we conclude that tna is a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens and is no better than d5%/w. the need to replace administration sets every 24 hours with tna should be reconsidered and ideally be studied in a prospective randomized trial.

TI  == direct antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gram-negative bacilli in blood cultures by an electrochemical method.
AB  == nonfastidious aerobic gram-negative bacilli (gnb) are commonly isolated from blood cultures. the feasibility of using an electrochemical method for direct antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gnb in positive blood cultures was evaluated. an aliquot (10 microliter) of 1:10-diluted positive blood cultures containing gnb was inoculated into the bactometer module well (biomerieux vitek,  hazelwood, mo.) containing 1 ml of mueller-hinton broth supplemented with an antibiotic. susceptibility tests were performed in a breakpoint broth dilution format, with the results being categorized as resistant, intermediate, or susceptible. seven antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, amikacin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin) were used in this study, with each agent being tested at the two interpretive breakpoint concentrations. the inoculated modules were incubated at 35 degreesc, and the change in impedance in  each well was continuously monitored for 24 h by the bactometer. the mics of the  seven antibiotics for each blood isolate were also determined by the standardized broth microdilution method. of 146 positive blood cultures (1,022 microorganism-antibiotic combinations) containing gnb tested by the direct method, the rates of very major, major, and minor errors were 0, 1.1, and 2.5%, respectively. the impedance method was simple; no centrifugation, preincubation,  or standardization of the inocula was required, and the susceptibility results were normally available within 3 to 6 h after inoculation. the rapid method may allow proper antimicrobial treatment almost 30 to 40 h before the results of the  standard methods are available.

TI  == radiological pulmonary changes during gram-negative bacillary nosocomial bloodstream infection in premature infants.
AB  == objective: the objective of the study was to characterize the changes that occur  in chest radiographs at the time of gram-negative bacilli (gnb) nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and to determine the contribution of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) and airway gram-negative bacterial pathogens to the clinical diagnosis of gnb nosocomial pneumonia. study design: this retrospective investigation involved 41 bsi infants (study group) and 50 gnb airway colonized infants who had sepsis workup with negative blood cultures (control group). we correlated clinical findings (95 blood and 305 tracheal aspirate (ta) cultures) with radiographic findings noted within 2 days before, the day of, and the day after blood cultures. two radiologists independently graded 258 films using a modified score for bpd and a semiquantitative score ("probable," "possible," or "unlikely") for pneumonia. results: mean birth weight was 1057 gm and 1044 gm for the study and control groups, respectively. of the study population, 54% were male, 21% were black, 89% received surfactant, 79% received dexamethasone, and 88% survived. average age at the time of blood cultures for both groups was 23 days. most common isolates from blood and ta were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. eight bsi infants died, mainly as a result of p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae; three control patients also died. radiological findings were that bpd scores did not change in relation to bsi and were similar between study and control groups. of the bsi patients, 21 presented with newly positive ta at the time of positive blood culture; "probable" or "possible" pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 of them. their bpd scores were higher than those of the remaining bsi patients, of whom seven were already airway colonized, nine had negative tas, and four were not intubated. only one of these 20 patients had "possible" pneumonia noted on chest  x-ray films. conclusion: radiographic signs of air space disease accompanied by the recovery of gnb respiratory pathogens from the blood and from a previously uncolonized airway strongly support the clinical diagnosis of gnb nosocomial pneumonia. radiological signs of bpd are stable in relation to nosocomial bsi caused by gnb, but bpd radiological scores are higher among infants who also had  a newly acquired respiratory gnb. bsi, new respiratory tract gnb, and bpd are critical associations for the clinical interpretation of radiographic changes in  the ventilated newborn.

AB  == background: cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of bush group 1 beta-lactamases. in vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli was studied. methods: the agar dilution method described by the us national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. these included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the tested clinical isolates included gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, group d enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, burkholderia cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia). results:  the activity of cefepime against most gram-negative bacilli other than b cepacia  and x maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. however, cefepime is less active against these gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the activity of cefepime against b cepacia and x maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. among gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, s pyogenes, viridans streptococci and s pneumoniae. however, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant s aureus and enterococci. conclusions: due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == in vivo activity and pharmacokinetic evaluation of a novel long-acting carbapenem antibiotic, mk-826 (l-749,345).
AB  == mk-826 (formerly l-749,345), is a potent 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long half-life and broad spectrum of activity. this compound is presently in phase-ii  clinical trials. its activity against a number of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was compared to those of imipenem (ipm) and eight other beta-lactam agents in two in vivo murine infection models. the distribution in tissue and pharmacokinetic properties of mk-826 and ceftriaxone (ctrx) were also evaluated in cd-1 mice following a single intraperitoneal dose (10 mg/kg of body weight). in addition, concentrations in plasma as well as biliary and urinary recovery of  mk-826 were compared to that of ctrx in a cannulated rat model. in a localized murine thigh infection model, mk-826 and ipm were superior to a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics in reduction of staphylococcus aureus cfu compared with results from nontreated controls (eliminating >/=4 log10 cfu). similar activities of ipm and mk-826 were observed in a gram-positive bacterial murine systemic infection model. while ipm demonstrated greater efficacy than mk-826 against enterobacter cloacae (50% effective doses [ed50s] of 0.062 and 0.227 mg/kg, respectively) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (ed50s of 0.142 and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively) systemic infections, mk-826 was 8- to 350-fold more efficacious than ipm against all other gram-negative organisms in this infection model. in mice, mk-826 demonstrated a higher peak concentration in serum (62.8 versus 42.6  microg/ml) and a larger area under the curve (auc) (150.8 versus 90.0 microg . hr/ml) than ctrx. the concentrations of mk-826 and ctrx in serum declined slowly, with levels of 3.6 and 2.0 microg/ml remaining, respectively, at 6 h posttreatment. the rat pharmacokinetic model showed the average auc of mk-826 to  be greater than that of ctrx (284 versus 142 microg . hr/ml) following a single 10-mg/kg dose. also, a half-life of mk-826 longer than that of ctrx (3.2 versus 2.3 h) was observed in this species. the total amount of drug excreted in the bile in 8 h was greater for ctrx (55 to 64% of the dose) than for mk-826 (6 to 12.5% of the dose). urinary recovery was similar for both antibiotics, with 16 to 18% of the dose recovered over an 8-h period. this excellent broad-spectrum in vivo efficacy of mk-826, together with advantageous pharmacokinetics, supports the argument for its further clinical development.

TI  == reconstituted recombinant factor viii can be safely infused continuously for at least three days: it is a poor microbial growth medium.
AB  == reconstituted recombinant factor viii (fviiirec) loses little biologic activity at room temperature for up to seven days and continuous infusion is convenient, effective hemostatically and requires less fviiirec concentrate than treatment by conventional bolus injections. however, the potential for bacterial contamination, with proliferation to high levels that can cause bacteremia, is a  concern with continuous infusion. we studied the growth properties at 4, 25 and 35 degrees c in reconstituted fviiirec (kogenate) and at 25 degrees c in 5% dextrose in water (d5%w) of three isolates each of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, flavobacterium spp. and candida albicans, species most likely to contaminate infusate during preparation or administration and which have been implicated in more than 95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infection traced to contaminated admixtures, biologic agents or medications administered parenterally. reconstituted fviiirec allowed growth of only three species at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c: s. marcescens, s. maltophilia and p. aeruginosa; logarithmic growth appeared only after 24-48 h. d5%w allowed growth of two gram-negative species, s. marcescens and b. cepacia. we conclude that reconstituted fviiirec (kogenate) is  a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens, comparable with d5%w. if reconstituted aseptically, continuous infusion of reconstituted fviiirec should be safe, and it should not be necessary to replace the container or tubing more frequently than every 3 days, an administration schedule that can provide effective hemostasis at lower cost.

TI  == bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies.
AB  == the decision regarding the appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies must be individualized in each institution, by taking into account variations in the patterns of microbial  isolates and their resistance profiles. microbial isolates and antibiotic resistance patterns must be taken into account at each hospital. a shift from bacteremia due to infections caused by predominantly gram-negative organisms to predominantly gram-positive organisms in patients with hematologic malignancies has been noted in reports from other countries. we investigated bacterial isolates and their antibiotic sensitivities in patients with hematologic malignancies in the veterans general hospital-taipei. a total of 185 episodes of  bacteremia in 140 patients with hematologic malignancies were recorded during the period from 1995 to 1996. unlike foreign reports, our investigation shows that gram-negative organisms still predominate, accounting for 72.7% of isolates, followed by gram-positive organisms, accounting for 26.3% of isolates, and anaerobes, accounting for 1% of isolates. escherichia coli was the most commonly  isolated organism, accounting for 23.9% of isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.2%), enterobacter cloacae (7.3%),  and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (7.3%). a high mortality rate was observed in gram-negative bacteremia: 31% for e. coli, 26% for k. pneumoniae, 24% for p. aeruginosa, and 33% for e. cloacae. if methicillin-resistant s. aureus bacteremia occurred, mortality was high (47%). the antibiotic sensitivity profiles of the four most common gram-negative isolates (e. coli, k. pneumoniae,  p. aeruginosa, and e. cloacae) indicated that, in our hospital, amikacin with either cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, or imipenem, would be an ideal combination for empirical therapy for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies.

TI  == imipenem resistance in aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a prospective study was undertaken to observe the emergence of resistance to imipenem, if any, among aerobic gram-negative bacteria. a total of 736 isolates were tested during 1994-95 and less than 1% of them were resistant to imipenem, whereas the next year ('95-'96) the rate increased to 11 of the 903 isolates tested. the resistant isolates during '94-'95 were all stenotrophomonas maltophilia whereas the spectrum of resistant bacterial species increased in '95-'96 to include pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii with a tendency to an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) in the later part of the year. a majority (72%) of the resistant isolates were from  patients with burns, and burn wounds were most frequently infected with such organisms. these data suggest that over a period of time aerobic gram-negative bacteria may develop resistance to imipenem and the pool of such bacteria increases with extensive use of the drug. non-fermentative aerobic bacteria tend  to develop resistance faster with widespread dissemination than enterobacteriaceae. hospital burn units are a potential source of development of  such resistance.

TI  == structural and functional implications of sequence diversity of pseudomonas aeruginosa genes oric, ampc and flic.
AB  == sequence analysis of three representative gene loci, oric, ampc and flic, in 19 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains revealed a low sequence diversity that does not correlate with the extensive diversity of p. aeruginosa habitats. single point mutations lead to a mean sequence diversity of 0.40%, 0.38% and 0.59% for oric, ampc and a-type flic, respectively, but of only 0.05% for b-type flagellin genes. the analyzed genes encode highly conserved functions that are subject to strong selective pressure. the detected nucleotide substitutions of oric, accumulating in a central 95 bp region, affect neither the putative dnaa binding sites nor the 13 bp direct repeats that presumably provide the sites to open oric duplex dna. even in p. aeruginosa strain dsm 1128, which exhibits an unusually high sequence  variability in several analyzed genes, the 9 bp and 13 bp motifs are conserved, reflecting their essential functional role in replication initiation. the two flagellin types, differing by 37-38% in their primary structure, exhibit pronounced structural and functional homology, as shown by alignment of flagellin variants by hydrophobicity index, probability of surface exposure, chain flexibility and antigenicity, and by cross-reactivity between both proteins using specific antisera. five nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions of ampc lead to beta-lactamase variants that differ in recognition and turnover of substrate, as  deduced from the three-dimensional structure of the highly homologous enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamase and confirmed by inhibition kinetics. the identified point mutations in the three genes are classified as selectively equivalent sequence variants indicating neutral genetic drift as a mechanism of molecular evolution in p. aeruginosa, rather than positive selection.

TI  == [the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefozopran against clinically isolated bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefozopran (czop) against recent clinical  isolates was evaluated and compared with those of ceftazidime (caz), cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), cefotaxime (ctx), sulbactam/cefoperazone (s/c), imipenem  (ipm), oxacillin (mpipc), and flomoxef (fmox). mic80 values of czop for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, n = 41), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, n = 57), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 45), enterococus faecalis (n = 49), enterobacter cloacae (n = 50), citrobacter freundii (n = 45), serratia marcescens (n = 45), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 100) were 1, 32, 2, 16, 4, 1, 0.25, 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. czop was more active than cpr against p. aeruginosa and exhibited similar activity to cpr against other species. czop was especially active against s. marcescens with mic values lower than 1 microgram/ml against all strains tested. czop was similarly active to or more active than cfpm against all species except for c. freundii. czop was not active against mrsa. thus, we investigated the in vitro combination effects of czop/vancomycin (vcm) and czop/arbekacin (abk) using the checkerboard method. the interaction between czop and vcm ranged  from additive activity (0.5 < fic index < or = 1.00, n = 37) to synergistic activity (fic index < 0.50, n = 1), except for one strain showing indifference (1.00 < fic index < or = 2.00). the interaction between czop and abk ranged from  additive activity (n = 22) to synergistic activity (n = 1). these date suggest the potential effect of combination therapy of (czop) and vcm or abk against mrsa. the combined therapy is suggested to be useful to reduce side effects in patients with impared renal function, to reduce the administration dose of vcm or to treat infections of sites where achievable drug concentrations are lower than  those commonly achieved in the bloodstream. we also investigated the combination  effects of czop/amk and czop/gm against czop-resistant p. aeruginosa (mic > 16 micrograms/ml). the combination of czop/amk showed additive activity (n = 9) to synergistic activity (n = 2). the combination of czop/gm showed additive activity (n = 5). these results suggest that combinations of czop with amk or gm are effective in treating p. aeruginosa.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == [penetration of meropenem in gram-negative bacilli. differences in activity with  imipenem].
AB  == the outer membrane of gramnegative bacteria cell-wall contain channels formed by  proteins known as porins, which facilitate the penetration of molecules into the  cell. imipenem and meropenem possess an important intrinsic activity against most gramnegative bacteria due to their high affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins pbp-2 and/or pbp-3. meropenem is slightly more active against certain species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and nonfermenters bacilli.  in this sense the differences in the activity between the two carbapenems may be  attributable to differences in their affinity for pbps, differences in their resistance to beta-lactamases hydrolysis, or to the differences in the capacity to employ certain porin channels. oprf is the main porin channel involved in the  beta-lactam penetration of bacteria, though oprc and oprd2 may also contribute to the penetration of carbapenems into p. aeruginosa. however, evidences suggest that although impenem requires the presence of oprd2, meropenem may use other pathways for penetration. in escherichia coli both carbapenems use ompf and ompc, and no specific porin channels have been detected. only in the case of enterobacter cloacae may exceptions exists among enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == new pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. these fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). variations at the c-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. the activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the c-8 substituent was in the order f (c5-nh2) > f (c5-h) > naphthyridine > cl = ome = h against gram-positive organisms. in the case of gram-negative strains, activity was in the order f (c5-nh2) > naphthyridine = f (c5-h) > h > cl > ome. the advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. in addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. among these compounds, compound 20 (lb20304) showed the best in vivo  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. the mics (microgram/ml) of lb20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: s. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), streptococcus epidermidis 887e (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), escherichia coli 3190y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), enterobacter cloacae p99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). on the basis of these promising results, lb20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of acquisition of ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacilli in a nonoutbreak setting.
AB  == we prospectively studied the acquisition of ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacilli (caz-rgn) in two surgical intensive care units (sicu) during a nonoutbreak period. surveillance cultures were obtained from patients at the time of admission and serially thereafter. caz-rgn isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). three hundred and forty-three patients were enrolled  from whom 1,621 baseline and follow-up cultures were obtained. the most common species isolated from patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22), enterobacter cloacae (21), acinetobacter spp. (13), enterobacter aerogenes (11), citrobacter spp. (10), pseudomonas spp. (non p. aeruginosa) (9), and stenotrophomonas spp. (7). for each species, pfge strain types were highly diverse; no single type was  recovered from more than four patients. twenty-eight patients acquired a caz-rgn  during the sicu stay; in six (21%), emergence of resistance from a previously susceptible strain was documented on the basis of matching serial strain types. transmission of caz-rgn between patients occurred but was infrequent, as judged by analyzing strain types of epidemiologically linked patients. in conclusion, colonization with caz-rgn in sicu was associated with diverse species and strains, as determined by molecular typing. emergence of resistance from previously susceptible strains appeared to be more important than horizontal transmission in acquisition of caz-rgn in a nonoutbreak period.

TI  == effects of requiring prior authorization for selected antimicrobials: expenditures, susceptibilities, and clinical outcomes.
AB  == antimicrobial control programs are widely used to decrease drug expenditures, but effects on antimicrobial resistance and outcomes for patients are unknown. when a requirement for prior authorization for selected parenteral antimicrobial agents  was initiated at our urban, county teaching hospital, total parenteral antimicrobial expenditures decreased by 32%. susceptibilities to all beta-lactam  and quinolone antibiotics increased, with dramatic increased susceptibilities in  isolates recovered in intensive care units, increased susceptibilities in isolates recovered in other inpatient sites, and little change in susceptibilities in isolates recovered in outpatient sites despite no change in infection control practices. for patients with bacteremia due to gram-negative organisms, overall survival did not change with restrictions. no differences occurred in the median time from initial positive blood culture to receipt of an  appropriate antibiotic or in the median time from positive blood culture to discharge from the hospital. thus, requiring preapproval for selected parenteral  agents can decrease antimicrobial expenditures and improve susceptibilities to antibiotics without compromising patient outcomes or length of hospital stay.

TI  == development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether intraluminal saline in breast implants can support the growth of common wound-infecting microorganisms over a prolonged period of time. the bacteria tested were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, corynebacterium jeikeium, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. three fungal species also were tested: aspergillus fumigatus, paecilomyces variotii, and candida albicans. in the in vitro study, four organisms survived in flasks of sterile saline for the 2 weeks in which serial cultures were performed: k. pneumoniae, c. albicans, a. fumigatus, and p.  variotii. in the in vivo study, 61 white rabbits (122 implants) received both an  experimental implant inoculated with one of the test organisms and a control implant containing only sterile saline. they were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, or 6-month scheduled endpoints. none of the control implants containing sterile saline had positive cultures. in contrast, the intraluminal saline was culture positive for 7 of the 10 inoculated organisms after varying lengths of time: s. epidermidis, e. coli, e. cloacae, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, a. fumigatus, and p. variotii. samples of capsular tissue also were cultured. of the 122 capsular tissue specimens, 21 (17 percent) had positive cultures and surrounded both inoculated and sterile implants. in most instances, capsules that were culture positive contained an organism different from the one that had been inoculated in the group. in only 3 cases was the same organism cultured from both the periprosthetic tissue and the intraluminal saline, and these may represent instances of the inoculated organism migrating through the implants filler valves. the data show that several types of bacteria (particularly gram-negative  species) and fungi can grow and reproduce in a restricted saline environment for  extended periods of time.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

TI  == susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to a photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == the photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd-arg(2)) on the growth of selected pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates is described as compared to the effect of hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd). growth inhibition  of hpd-arg(2) of three gram-positive strains (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus) and five laboratory strains of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) was observed as well. serratia marcescens strain was resistant to light-activated hpd-arg(2) or hpd. the antimicrobial activity of light-activated hpd-arg(2) against p. aeruginosa may offer an additional option in the anti-pseudomonal therapy of wounds.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in isolates from inpatients and outpatients in the united states: increasing importance of the intensive care unit.
AB  == to compare the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals with that in the community, we analyzed data for isolates collected from inpatients and outpatients in eight u.s. hospitals. the percentage of resistant isolates from inpatients was higher than that from outpatients for the following combinations of antimicrobials and organisms: methicillin/coagulase-negative staphylococcus (49.0% vs. 36.0%, respectively; p < .01); methicillin/staphylococcus aureus (33.0% vs. 14.5%, respectively; p < .01); ceftazidime/enterobacter cloacae (26.0% vs. 12.0%, respectively; p < .01); imipenem/pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.0% vs. 6.5%, respectively; p < .01); ceftazidime/p. aeruginosa (7.8% vs. 4.0%, respectively; p < .01); and vancomycin/enterococcus species (6.3% vs. 1.4%, respectively; p < .01). there was a significant stepwise decrease in the percentage of resistant organisms isolated from patients in the intensive care unit (icu), non-icu inpatients, and outpatients. these results suggest that resources allocated to control antimicrobial resistance should continue to be focused in the hospital, particularly in the icu.

TI  == differential distributions in tissues and efficacies of aztreonam and ceftazidime and in vivo bacterial morphological changes following treatment.
AB  == the differential tissue distributions of aztreonam and ceftazidime within fibrin  clots infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens, their efficacies, and the in vivo bacterial morphological changes induced by these drugs were evaluated. rabbits were given intravenously a single  dose of 100 mg of either agents/kg of body weight. in the cores of the clots, the peak levels of both drugs were much lower than those observed in the peripheries  and in serum. aztreonam's half-lives within the peripheries and in the cores of the fibrin clots were up to six times higher than observed in serum, while ceftazidime's half-lives in clots were twice that observed in serum. this resulted in a much greater penetration ratio for aztreonam than for ceftazidime.  both drugs controlled the growth of p. aeruginosa in vivo, but e. cloacae and s.  marcescens responded better to ceftazidime. morphological changes were more abundant in the peripheries than in the cores of the clots. in the control group, p. aeruginosa's morphology in the cores was different than that in the peripheries of the clots. against p. aeruginosa, aztreonam did induce morphological changes in the cores while ceftazidime did not. electron microscopic studies revealed that morphological changes associated with aztreonam seemed different than those of ceftazidime. along with elongation of bacteria, more bow tie and herniated bacteria were observed with aztreonam. though both agents selectively affect pbp 3, as manifested by elongated bacteria, they induce in the peripheries of the clots thickening, breaks, and detachment in bacterial cell walls, alterations which are generally associated with antibiotics affecting pbp 1a and 1b.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpirome against microorganisms isolated in haematology, oncology and intensive care units in switzerland.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was investigated in the 5 university hospitals of switzerland, and compared to 9 other antibiotics mainly used in hospitals, such as ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, piperacillin, imipenem, gentamicin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. a total number of 992 strains collected only from intensive care units and haematology-oncology units were tested by microdilution  according to nccls. cefpirome showed an excellent activity against all enterobacteriaceae (mic90 = 4 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90 = 1 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 0.25 mg/l) and haemophilus influenzae (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l) isolates. its activity was superior to that of third-generation cephalosporins against cephalosporinase-depressed mutants of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii isolates (mic90 > 32 mg/l for third-generation cephalosporins vs 4 mg/l for cefpirome). the mics of cefpirome of 3 strains of klebsiella spp. with an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase were lower (mic90 = 2 mg/l) than those of third-generation cephalosporins (mics90 > 32 mg/l). against pseudomonas aeruginosa cefpirome was as active as ceftazidime. the activity of cefpirome was poor against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and nosocomial gram-negative bacteria such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == bacteriocins: nature, function and structure.
AB  == bacteriocins are extracellular substances produced by different types of bacteria, including both gram positive and gram negative species. they can be produced spontaneously or induced by certain chemicals such as mitomycin c. they  are biologically one of the important substances, and have been found to be useful in membrane studies and also in typing pathogenic microorganisms causing serious nosocomial infections. bacteriocins are a heterogeneous group of particles with different morphological and biochemical entities. they range from  a simple protein to a high molecular weight complex: the active moiety of each molecule in all cases seems to be protein in nature. the genetic determinants of  most of the bacteriocins are located on the plasmids, apart from few which are chromosomally encoded. these bactericidal particles are species specific. they exert their lethal activity through adsorption to specific receptors located on the external surface of sensitive bacteria, followed by metabolic, biological and morphological changes resulting in the killing of such bacteria. this review summarises the classification, biochemical nature, morphology and mode of action  of bacteriocins as well as their genetic determinants and the microbiological relevance of these bactericidal agents.

TI  == growth promotion of mycobacterium avium-m. intracellulare complex by enterobacterial acetate.
AB  == a mycobacterial growth factor was present in the conditioned media of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae cultures, but not in pseudomonas aeruginosa culture. this factor potentiated the growth of mycobacterium avium-m. intracellulare complex (mac), a patient isolate, and well-established strains of  m. avium and m. intracellulare. the growth factor was not a polypeptide; it was heat-stable and possessed a molecular weight < 500 d. acetate production by enterobacteria was responsible for the biological activities observed. acetate promoted mycobacterial growth at concentrations up to 3 mm; higher levels were toxic. the effects of acetate on mac growth were not influenced by the ph of the  media. our data suggest that production of acetate by enterobacteria may regulate mycobacterial growth, and therefore, intestinal acetate might be a cofactor in the pathogenicity of mac.

TI  == management of intra-abdominal infections. the case for intraoperative cultures and comprehensive broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. the canadian intra-abdominal infection study group.
AB  == objective: to test the hypothesis that comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy is superior to limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy in intra-abdominal infections. design: prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. setting: university-affiliated hospitals in canada. patients: two hundred thirteen patients with intra-abdominal infections and planned operative or percutaneous drainage. intervention: limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoxitin sodium, 2 g, intravenously, every 6 hours (n = 109). comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy consisted of a combination of imipenem and cilastatin sodium, 500 mg, intravenously, every 6 hours (n = 104). main outcome measures: failure to cure the intra-abdominal infection (persistence of infection or death). results: of initial isolates, 98% were sensitive to imipenem plus cilastin sodium compared with 72% for cefoxitin. no difference was found in the failure rate between treatment groups. among various reasons for failure (including technical), 12 of 80 patients in the limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group had resistant organisms at a second intervention compared with 1 of 74 in the comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group (p < .003, chi 2). one death in the limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group was due to autopsy-proved disseminated pseudomonas aeruginosa (blood, peritoneum, lung, and pleural fluid) that was resistant to cefoxitin, and the other was associated with peritonitis due to cefoxitin-resistant enterobacter cloacae. one death in the comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group was associated with peritonitis from clostridium perfringens that was sensitive to imipenem plus cilastin sodium, and the other was associated with peritonitis from pseudomonas aeruginosa that was resistant to imipenem plus cilastin sodium. conclusion: treatment failure of intra-abdominal infection may be due, in part, to the presence of resistant pathogens at the site of infection. therefore, routine culture of these sites seems worthwhile and empirical therapy should be as comprehensive as possible and should cover all potential pathogens.

AB  == objectives: antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from january to december  1992 was evaluated. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin,  fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). criteria of comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie were followed for interpretation. betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. the main species isolated were escherichia coli (45%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), salmonella spp. (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (4%) and klebsiella oxytoca (4%). most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). most of  the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. among 89 p. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. resistance rates are very high  for acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. conclusion: production of tem-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for k. pneumoniae.

TI  == combination antimicrobial therapy for bacterial infections. guidelines for the clinician.
AB  == therapy with antimicrobial combinations has been used as long as antimicrobials have been available. combinations of antibiotics are often used to take advantage of different mechanisms of action and/or toxicity profiles. well established indications for combination antimicrobial therapy include: (a) empirical treatment of life-threatening infections; (b) treatment of polymicrobial infections; (c) prevention of the emergence of bacterial resistance; and (d) for  synergism. disadvantages of combination therapy include: (a) increased expense; (b) increased risk of adverse effects; (c) antagonism; and (d) superinfection. combination antimicrobial therapy should be considered for the treatment of serious gram-negative infections caused by enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens, and certain gram-positive infections caused by enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. selection of agents should be dependent upon local susceptibility patterns, clinical experience, site of infection, potential toxicities and cost.

AB  == a plasmidic beta-lactamase which hydrolyzed cephamycins was first detected and reported in 1989. at that time its description was restricted to phenotypic characteristics. we analyzed nucleotide sequence of its gene and explored it genetic relationship with other bla genes. the deduced amino acid sequence of the blacmy-1 product was compared with those of other known plasmidic cephamycinases  and of chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases. the results indicate that the relationship of cmy-1 is closest to mox-1 among the plasmidic cephamycinases and  to ampc of pseudomonas aeruginosa among the chromosomal cephalosporinases. we conclude that the plasmidic cephamycinases described up to now may be classified  into three families, as follows: cmy-1, mox-1, and fox-1 with ampc of p. aeruginosa; cmy-2, bil-1 and lat-1 with ampc of citrobacter freundii; and mir-1 with ampc of enterobacter cloacae. plasmidic cephamycinases are now recognized as clinically relevant class c beta-lactamases.

AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == group of peptides that act synergistically with hydrophobic antibiotics against gram-negative enteric bacteria.
AB  == a synthetic peptide, kffkffkffk [corrected], consisting of cationic lysine residues and hydrophobic phenylalanine residues was found to sensitize gram-negative bacteria to hydrophobic and amphipathic antibiotics. at a concentration of 3 micrograms/ml, it decreased the mic of rifampin for smooth, encapsulated escherichia coli by a factor of 300. other susceptible bacterial species included enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium, but pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant. similar results were obtained with another synthetic peptide, ikflkflkflk [corrected]. the fractional  inhibitory concentration indices for the synergism of these peptides with rifampin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, and novobiocin were very close to those determined for the previously characterized potent outer-membrane-disorganizing agents polymyxin b nonapeptide and deacylpolymyxin b. kffkffkffk [corrected] had  direct activity against the gram-positive organism micrococcus strain ml36, was strongly hemolytic, and was as active on polymyxin-resistant e. coli mutants as on their parent. these three attributes made kffkffkffk [corrected] different from polymyxin derivatives and similar to cationic detergents, such as cetylpyridinium chloride. however, whereas the mic of cetylpyridinium chloride for e. coli is low (0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml), that of kffkffkffk [corrected] is much higher (30 to 100 micrograms/ml). other groups of synthetic peptides studied included polymyxin-like peptides with an intrachain disulfide bridge. their synergism with antibiotics was less marked. still other peptides, including kekekekeke and kkkkkkflfl, lacked any synergism with the probe antibiotics.

TI  == diffusion of carbapenems through the outer membrane of enterobacteriaceae and correlation of their activities with their periplasmic concentrations.
AB  == scarce information is available on the real mechanism by which carbapenemes penetrate in enterobacteriaceae, although a considerable amount of evidence suggests that in many species of this family the lack of certain outer membrane proteins is associated with the acquisition of resistance to these antibiotics. the existance of specific pathways for the carbapenems has never been demonstrated, although at times it has been postulated in both wild and mutant strains, on the basis of evident discordances between permeability patterns and suceptibility data. by using the zimmerman and rosselet technique, which requires the strain under investigation to harbor a suitable beta-lactamase, the permeability of intact escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae cells to meropenem and imipenem was investigated by transferring a constructed vector carrying the carbapenem hydrolyzing cpha metallo-beta-lactamase gene into the parental strains and their porin-deficient mutants. reduced amounts of nonspecific porins significantly reduced the penetration of both carbapenems. the virtual absence of porins caused the mics of meropenem to increase, mostly in enterobacter cloacae, while it did not affected the mics of imipenem. no evidence of specific porin pathways of the type described in pseudomonas aeruginosa was found.

TI  == a simple gel electrophoretic method for analyzing the muropeptide composition of  bacterial peptidoglycan.
AB  == the muropeptide composition of bacterial peptidoglycan is currently most efficiently determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc). though sensitive, the hplc procedure is technically demanding and has been applied to a relatively small number of bacterial strains and species. we have found that fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (face) is a simple, rapid method by which reducing muropeptides from multiple peptidoglycan samples can be visualized. individual reducing muropeptides were covalently labeled with the fluorescent molecule 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid,  after which they were separated by electrophoresis through a 35% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to uv light. face detected the appropriate numbers of reducing muropeptides in the proper proportions for four bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and yersinia enterocolitica.  as little as 2 to 5 pmol per muropeptide was detected when the intensity of the fluorescent signal was measured with a charge-coupled device camera, at a level of sensitivity between 50 and 250 times higher than that of the classic hplc technique. thus, face may be used to identify interesting peptidoglycan samples prior to more-extensive analysis by hplc, or face may eventually replace hplc for some applications.

TI  == comparative activity of eight antimicrobial agents against clinical bacterial isolates from the united states, measured by two methods.
AB  == in a surveillance study conducted during 1992-1993 at 83 medical institutions of  different types and sizes (e.g., laboratories, community hospitals, teaching hospitals) and from different geographical areas of the united states, clinical bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to eight comparative antimicrobial agents (cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and piperacillin). a total of 12,574 isolates were tested by either the etest method (ab biodisk) or a microdilution method (microscan) in the participating laboratories; 11.8% of these isolates were subsequently retested for quality assurance purposes by both methods in a central laboratory. the results obtained in the central laboratory were essentially the same as the results obtained in the participating laboratories. this article presents data for gram-negative and gram-positive isolates other than streptococcus pneumoniae, the results of which have been previously published. antimicrobial susceptibility results obtained with the two different minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods--microscan and etest--showed that  most isolates of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefepime, exceeding the activity of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime, principally because of the  greater activity of cefepime against the species that produce bush group 1 beta-lactamases (predominantly enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and  citrobacter freundii). in addition, the activity of cefepime against pseudomonas  aeruginosa isolates was essentially equivalent to that of ceftazidime and greater than that of third-generation cephalosporins. most methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to all the cephalosporins, whereas methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci were resistant. overall, the most active antimicrobials in this study were imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, but the activity of all the antimicrobials varied with different species. categorically, the results from the microdilution and etest methods were equivalent.

AB  == objective: to determine the cause(s) of an outbreak of gram-negative bacteremia (gnb) in open-heart-surgery (ohs) patients at hospital a. design: case-control and cohort studies and an environmental survey. results: nine patients developed  gnb with enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (3), serratia marcescens (2), or klebsiella oxytoca (1) following ohs; five of nine patients had polymicrobial bacteremia. when the gnb patients were compared with randomly selected ohs patients, having had the first procedure of the day (8 of 9 versus 12 of 27, p = .02), longer cardiopulmonary bypass (median, 122 versus 83 minutes, p = .01) or cross-clamp times (median, 75 versus 42 minutes, p = .008), intraoperative dopamine infusion (9 of 9 versus 15 of 27, p = .01), or exposure to scrub nurse 6 (6 of 9 versus 4 of 27, p = .001) were identified as risk factors. when stratified by length of the procedure, only being the first procedure of the day and exposure to scrub nurse 6 remained significant. first procedures used pressure-monitoring equipment that was assembled before surgery and left open and uncovered overnight in the operating room, whereas other procedures used pressure-monitoring equipment assembled immediately before the procedure. at night, operating rooms were cleaned by maintenance personnel who used a disinfectant-water solution sprayed through a hose connected to an automatic diluting system. observation of the use of this hose documented that this solution could have contacted and entered uncovered pressure-monitoring equipment left in the operating room. water samples from the  hose revealed no disinfectant, but grew p aeruginosa. the outbreak was terminated by setting up pressure-monitoring equipment immediately before the procedure and  discontinuing use of the hose-disinfectant system. conclusions: this outbreak most likely resulted from contamination of uncovered preassembled pressure-monitoring equipment by water from a malfunctioning spray disinfectant device. pressure-monitoring equipment should be assembled immediately before use  and protected from possible environmental contamination.

AB  == sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic, was compared with other antibiotics with regard to in vitro antibacterial and bactericidal activities, stabilization against beta-lactamases, and effect on the release of lipopolysaccharide from gram-negative bacteria. the results are summarized as follows. 1. sulopenem showed more potent activities than other antibiotics against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2. sulopenem showed potent bactericidal activities (mic/mbc) against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. time kill studies against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii showed potent bactericidal activities of sulopenem. 3. sulopenem was found to possess a stronger activity than other antibiotics against beta-lactamase-producing strains except p. aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. 4. in particular, sulopenem was found to be more stable to the hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative bacteria than any other antibiotics tested. vmax/km values of sulopenem were smaller than those of cefotiam for all tested beta-lactamases, which reflected a broad antibacterial spectrum of sulopenem. 5. e. coli ml4707 exposed to sulopenem and imipenem released less endotoxin than did controls at all concentration ranges tested. in contrast, the  strain exposed to ceftazidime at bacteriostatic concentrations released a large amount of endotoxin.

AB  == eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml,  enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, escherichia coli cs2(r+): 0.10 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, serratia marcescens:  1.56 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam  against gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of pbps of s. aureus, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, even of p. aeruginosa. affinities of sulopenem to pbps-1 and -3 of s. aureus, pbp-2 of e. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (ipm). sulopenem generally has small ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to ia and iib types of beta-lactamases than ipm. no synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. however, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. the cells of e. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 mic of sulopenem. moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-is. sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.

TI  == visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries.
AB  == visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis were investigated in 226 inpatients who sustained electrical burns over a period of 15 years. four patients who sustained thoracic and abdominal organ injuries were noted in this series. the patients had injuries of the small intestine, stomach, colon and the lung. all the patients received operative treatment. two of them died of sepsis. injuries to the internal organs should always be considered following high-voltage injuries, and they should be managed as early as possible. the data concerning wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries were evaluated in three  consecutive 5-year periods. over this period of 15 years, different antibiotic regimens were used for prophylaxis and treatment. most patients in the current series had been contaminated or infected by various pathogens prior to admission. long-lasting administration of prophylactic antibiotics in these patients showed  no improvement in controlling the sepsis. after 1987, most of the microorganisms  were eliminated following more effective antimicrobial therapy. the progressive decrease in infection frequency of species such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae, appeared to be causally related to the changes in the general therapeutic protocol which included new antibiotics. the infections caused by e. coli and staphylococcus aureus showed a rather steady state. a marked increase in frequency of negative wound cultures was also noted between the years 1989 and 1993. a gradual decrease in mortality rates was observed from the first to the last 5-year period, whereas mortality rates due to sepsis showed a gradual but slower decline. sepsis (142 patients comprising 62.8  per cent of the total mortality rate) was the most frequent complication resulting in death.

TI  == susceptibility of corneal and conjunctival pathogens to ciprofloxacin.
AB  == ciprofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution has been shown to be effective in the treatment of bacterial keratitis and conjunctivitis, and many physicians use ciprofloxacin as sole therapy in these conditions. in this retrospective study, we found seven of 84 isolates from corneal and conjunctival cultures that were resistant to ciprofloxacin. all of the resistant organisms were gram positive. six of the isolates (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis, and four isolates of the streptococcus viridans group) were from corneal cultures, and one (staphylococcus aureus) was from a conjunctival culture. yearly records of systemic isolates from 1988 to 1993 (n = 35,308) demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in susceptibility for several organisms that are common pathogens in the conjunctiva and cornea: pseudomonas aeruginosa (95-90%, p = 0.001); staphylococcus aureus (96-87%, p < 0.0001); staphylococcus spp., coagulase negative (97-81%, p < 0.0001); enterococcus spp. (92-79%, p < 0.0001);  acinetobacter anitratus (97-77%, p = 0.0006); and enterobacter cloacae (100-96%,  p = 0.03). although the susceptibility of corneal and conjunctival isolates in this series remained relatively high (91.7%), a much larger series of systemic isolates that are common ocular pathogens revealed a statistically significant increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin over the preceding 5 years.

TI  == serum bactericidal activities and comparative pharmacokinetics of meropenem and imipenem-cilastatin.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities (sbas) of imipenem and meropenem were investigated in a randomized crossover study. twelve healthy male  volunteers received a constant 30-min infusion of either 1 g of imipenem plus 1 g of cilastatin or 1 g of meropenem. the concentrations of the drugs in serum and urine were determined by bioassay and high-pressure liquid chromatography. pharmacokinetic parameters were based on an open two-compartment model and a noncompartmental technique. at the end of infusion, the mean concentrations of imipenem and meropenem measured in serum were 61.2 +/- 9.8 and 51.6 +/- 6.5 mg/liter, respectively; urinary recoveries were 48.6% +/- 8.2% and 60.0% +/- 6.5% of the dose in 12 h, respectively; and the areas under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity were 96.1 +/- 14.4 and 70.5 +/- 10.3 mg.h/liter, respectively (p < or = 0.02). imipenem had a mean half-life of 66.7 +/- 10.4 min; that of meropenem was 64.4 +/- 6.9 min. the volumes of distribution at steady state of imipenem and meropenem were 15.3 +/- 3.3 and 18.6 +/- 3.0 liters/70 kg,  respectively, and the mean renal clearances per 1.73 m2 were 85.6 +/- 17.6 and 144.6 +/- 26.0 ml/min, respectively. both antibiotics were well tolerated in this single-dose administration study. the sbas were measured by the microdilution method of reller and stratton (l. b. reller and c. w. stratton, j. infect. dis. 136:196-204, 1977) against 40 clinically isolated strains. mean reciprocal bactericidal titers were measured 1 and 6 h after administration. after 1 and 6 h the median sbas for imipenem and meropenem, were 409 and 34.9 and 97.9 and 5.8, respectively, against staphylococcus aureus, 19.9 and 4.4 and 19.4 and 4.8, respectively, against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 34.3 and 2.2 and 232 and 15.5, respectively, against enterobacter cloacae, and 13.4 and 2.25 and 90.7 and 7.9, respectively, against proteus mirabilis. both drugs had rather short biological elimination half-lives and a predominantly renal route of elimination. both carbapenems revealed high sbas against clinically important pathogens at 1 h; meropenem had a higher sba against e. cloacae and p. mirabilis, and the sba of imipenem against s. aureus was greater than the sba of meropenem.

TI  == levels and identities of nonrhizobial microorganisms found in commercial legume inoculant made with nonsterile peat carrier.
AB  == sixty samples of commercial north american legume inoculants manufactured for sale in 1994 using nonsterile peat as carrier were tested for rhizobium (or bradyrhizobium) content and non-rhizobium biological contaminant load. products of three major producers of such inoculants for sale in canada were examined. viable rhizobium content varied from 5.6 x 10(5) to 8.1 x 10(9) cells/g, while the contaminant load varied from 1.8 x 10(8) to 5.5 x 10(10) cfu/g. most of the inoculants contained more nonrhizobial organisms than they did rhizobia. identifications were made of the most numerous nonrhizobial bacteria occurring in 100 samples of inoculants collected in 1993 and 1994. the most commonly identified contaminant was xanthomonas maltophilia. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae were also found at high levels in some products. contaminant organisms capable of inhibiting rhizobial growth in plate culture were found in the products of all three manufacturers.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase among clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria in riyadh.
AB  == the activity of ciprofloxacin, imipenem and 12 other commonly used antibiotics was evaluated against 106 documented clinical isolates from a medical intensive care unit (icu). the resistance rates to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, aztreonam and ceftazidime were 42, 25, 24 and 21%, respectively. apart from pseudomonas aeruginosa, all isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and imipenem. complete cross resistance among tested beta-lactam groups was uniformly evident in enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and p. aeruginosa. on the other hand,  penicillins and second generation cephalosporins showed cross resistance among escherichia coli and klebseilla pneumoniae isolates. induction experiments indicate that 70 and 62% of p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae or c. freundii produce class i cephalosporinase, respectively. among all tested isolates, plasmid mediated extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) was detected in one isolate of k. pneumoniae. the plasmid mediated beta-lactamase is transferable and inhibited  by beta-lactamase inhibitors. the transconjugates not only expressed resistance to extended spectrum beta-lactams and aztreonam but also toward tested aminoglycoside antibiotics, with the exception of gentamicin. the obtained transconjugates conferred high level resistance to ceftazidime and aztreonam but  considerably low resistance to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. the isoelectric point  for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase is 8.2.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial properties of t-5575 and t-5578 novel parenteral 2-carboxypenams.
AB  == t-5575 and t-5578, novel 2-carboxypenams in which a carboxyl group has been introduced into the c-2 beta position of the nucleus, were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial properties. the spectrum of activity of t-5575 was similar to that of aztreonam. however, it showed stronger activities than those of aztreonam against most gram-negative bacteria. t-5575 also showed potent activities against isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime, with mics at which 90% of the isolates were  inhibited of 0.39, 0.39, and 3.13 microgram/ml, respectively. t-5578 showed moderate levels of activity against gram-negative bacteria, compared with those of t-5575. its activity against p. aeruginosa, however, was superior to those of  t-5575 and the reference drugs tested. the most characteristic feature of t-5578  was its potent activities against ceftazidime-, imipenem-, and gentamicin-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates, with mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited at 0.39, 3.13, and 3.13 microgram/ml, respectively. these two compounds were unfortunately poorly active against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococci. both compounds were found to be stable for hydrolysis by various kinds of beta-lactamases and to have low affinities for these enzymes, with ki values of > 100 microm. these novel penams  bound most tightly to penicillin-binding protein 3 of escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results indicate that t-5575 and t-5578 can be regarded as promising 2-carboxypenams specially targeted against gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == isolation and sequence analysis of rpoh genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mrna and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  == the rpoh genes encoding homologs of escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): enterobacter cloacae (gamma), serratia marcescens (gamma), proteus mirabilis (gamma), agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and zymomonas mobilis (alpha). comparison of these and three known genes from e.coli (gamma), citrobacter freundii (gamma) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. both the sequence complementary to part of 16s rrna (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mrna secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in e.coli were found for the rpoh genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues q(r/k)(k/r)lffnlr, designated the 'rpoh box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in dnak/dnaj chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. in addition, a putative sigma e (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoh genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. these results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in e.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.

TI  == [pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  == isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (vc), forced expiratory volume (fev1.0), pao2 and paco2. vc of the patients from whom mssa (methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus) or enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), branhamella catarrhalis (b. catarrhalis) or haemophilus influenza (h. influenza)  were isolated. fev1.0 had a similar tendency as vc in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. similarly, po2 of the patients from whom mssa or e. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated, and pco2  of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza were isolated. there was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom  mssa, escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), xanthomonas maltophilia (x. maltophilia) or enterobacter cloacae (e. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom s. pneumonia, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated. these results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza to mssa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, x. maltophilia or e. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. the treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.

TI  == the relationship between antecedent antibiotic use and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in group i beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
AB  == gram-negative pathogens are increasingly resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (escs). using a prospective, case-controlled observational study,  we examined the prevalence and the risk factors for development of resistance to  escs in group i beta-lactamase-producing organisms. of the 386 isolates of enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter species, and serratia marsescens from 340 consecutive patients, 70 (18.1%) were resistant to escs; the  highest rates of resistance were found among citrobacter freundii (40.9%), enterobacter cloacae (31.1%), and enterobacter aerogenes isolates (18.9%). patients' prior antibiotic use and the mean number of antibiotics used were significantly greater in association with resistant vs. susceptible isolates. resistance was associated with prior use of ceftizoxime or cefotaxime (p = .008), ceftazidime (p = .004), and piperacillin (p = .001). other antibiotics were not associated with resistance. resistance was less frequent in patients receiving escs and an aminoglycoside. we conclude that prior use of escs is associated with the isolation of resistant group i beta-lactamase-producing organisms. concomitant use of an aminoglycoside may decrease this risk.

TI  == bacterial pneumonia in recipients of bone marrow transplantation. a five-year prospective study.
AB  == bacterial pneumonia as an important complication of bone marrow transplantation (bmt) has not been subjected to comprehensive analysis. two hundred fifty-five consecutive allogeneic and autologous bmt recipients, ranging in age from 1 month to 53 years, were prospectively followed for 3 days to 3 years (median, 108 days) for development of bacterial pneumonia. etiology, place acquired, chest radiography, and outcome were recorded and the association between bacterial pneumonia and demographic and clinical variables was analyzed. thirty-seven (15%) patients experienced 52 episodes of bacterial pneumonia: onset of 13 episodes occurred within 30 days after transplantation, 10 episodes occurred on days +31 to +100, and 29 episodes occurred thereafter. bacterial pneumonia was the terminal event or contributed to fatal outcome in 8 patients (22% of bacterial pneumonia cases, 3% total study population). mortality due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (6/21) was significantly higher than (p = 0.03). bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 (52%) episodes. during the first 100 days after bmt, hospital-acquired gram-negative bacteria predominated, caused mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter lwoffi, and enterobacter cloacae. after day +100, community-acquired, gram-positive bacteria  predominated, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae. haemophilus influenzae occurred periodically. considering all episodes, significant association was found between bacterial pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease (vod) (p < 0.01) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) (p < 0.02). for culture-positive episodes, the association between bacterial pneumonia and vod was significant (p  < 0.001) and borderline for acute gvhd (p = 0.07). it is concluded that vod and gvhd are positively associated with post-bmt bacterial pneumonia. its incidence,  etiology, risk factors, and outcome are important considerations in its prevention and treatment.

AB  == detection of pyrrolidonyl-aryl-amidase activity (pyr) is an important tool to identify gram-positive cocci, such as staphylococci, enterococci, streptococci, and other related genera. however, only few studies evaluating its usefulness with gram-negative rods have been published. thus, a prospective study including  542 and 215 unique clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative gram-negative rods, respectively, was undertaken. strains were identified by conventional methods. pyr test was performed using a commercial kit, according to the manufacturer recommendations. positive results were uniformly obtained for the pyr test with the following species: citrobacter spp, klebsiella spp, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans group, serratia marcescens and s. odorifera. on the other hand, negative results were uniformly displayed by e.  coli (including inactive e. coli), protease group, salmonellia spp, shigella spp, acinetobacter spp, burkholderia (pseudomonas) cepacia and flavobacterium spp. variable results were shown in pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) malthophilia, kluyvera cryocrescens, and enterobacter cloacae. pyr  test proved to be a reliable and simple tool to rapidly distinguish certain species belonging to enterobacteriaceae (ie. citrobacter freundii from salmonella spp, and inactive e. coli from k. ozaenae). further studies, including a wide diversity of species, are required to assess usefulness of the pyr test for the identification of non-fermentative gram-negative rods.

TI  == [clinical and laboratory significance of inducible beta-lactamases].
AB  == many species of bacteria have inducible expression of beta-lactamase and the enzyme production in these bacteria is normally held at a low level by a repressor mechanism, but in the presence of a beta-lactamase inducer this repression is lifted and enzyme production is greatly increased. inducible synthesis of beta-lactamase was first described for the gram-positive organism bacillus licheniformis. after that inducible expression of beta-lactamase was discovered in gram-negative bacteria like enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, serratia spp and aeromonas spp. inducible beta-lactamases belong into class i according to richmond and sykes. they are chromosomally mediated cephalosporinases. beta-lactam antibiotics differ in their inducing power. cefoxitin and imipenem are among the strongest inducers. induction of beta-lactamase caused by these substances can lead to antagonism with other beta-lactam antibiotics if they are  used in combination. the most important clinical problem connected with inducible beta-lactamases is the emergence of multiple resistant strains which are associated with therapeutic failures. it is important to distinguish induction from derepression. induction is a temporary phenomenon in which an inducer interacts with a functional ampd protein, which consequently prevents complexing  of the ampd and ampr proteins. in contrast, genetic derepression is permanent and results from synthesis of a defective ampd protein unable to complex with the ampr protein.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

TI  == antibiotic-induced endotoxin release in patients with gram-negative urosepsis: a  double-blind study comparing imipenem and ceftazidime.
AB  == the clinical significance of differences between antibiotics in endotoxin-liberating potential is unknown. thirty patients with gram-negative urosepsis were randomized between imipenem and ceftazidime, which have, respectively, a low and a high endotoxin-liberating potential in vitro. in patients treated with ceftazidime, a slower defervescence was noticed. after 4 h  of treatment, the blood endotoxin level decreased in all 3 endotoxemic patients receiving imipenem, whereas it increased in 2 of the 4 endotoxemic patients receiving ceftazidime, and in ceftazidime-treated patients, the endotoxin level in urine decreased less than in imipenem-treated subjects. serum and urine cytokine levels increased 10%-40% after 4 h of ceftazidime treatment compared with no increase in the imipenem-treated patients (p > .05). endotoxin release during antibiotic killing in vitro, assessed for all microorganisms, was 10-fold  higher with ceftazidime (p < .001). these results indicate that differences between antibiotics in endotoxin release may affect the inflammatory response during treatment.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of june 1989 to may 1990. of the above total bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a  majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were escherichia coli. 1. enterococcus faecalis imipenem (ipm) showed the highest activity against e. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. the followings, ampicillin (abpc) and vancomycin (vcm)  showed potent activities, with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. piperacillin (pipc), minocycline (mino) and chloramphenicol (cp) were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus vcm showed the highest activity  against s. aureus with mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. dicloxacillin (mdipc) and arbekacin (abk) were active with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. mino showed the mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. all other agents except ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed lower activity. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis mino showed the highest activity against s. epidermidis. its mic90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. the followings, abk and  vcm were also active with the mic90s of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the others except cpfx were not so active. 4. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) most of the agents were active against cns. ipm, abk and mino showed the highest activities with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. mdipc, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm) and vcm were also active with the mic90s of 1 microgram/ml. clindamycin (cldm) showed lower activity, with the mic90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. streptococcus agalactiae cez, cefuzonam (czon), ipm and cldm showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the mic of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. the followings, cefmenoxime (cmx) and erythromycin (em) were active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. pipc and vcm were also active with the mic90s 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively  amikacin (amk) showed lower activity. escherichia coli ipm, ctm, flomoxef (fmox), cmx, carumonam (crmn), norfloxacin (nflx), ofloxacin (oflx) and cpfx showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mic90s of them were .125 microgram/ml or  below. ceftazidime (caz) and czon were also active with the mic90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. penicillins except mecillinam (mpc) were not so active showing the  mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. klebsiella pneuminiae fmox, cmx, cefixime (cfix), ipm, crmn and nflx showed the highest activities against k. pneumoniae.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == typing of sequential bacterial isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  == we typed 39 sets of multiple bacterial isolates of the same species from patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna (pfge). isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. staphylococcus aureus,  enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae were tested. excluding e. cloacae, 28 of 32  sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related pfge types.  four of the seven sets of e. cloacae showed different types. for species other than e. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. unlike all of the other tested species, e. cloacae pfge typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.

TI  == inhibitory action of metabolites of pseudomonas aeruginosa against gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == fifty clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, klebsiella  pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both e. coli and enterobacter  cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against  s. infantis, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. the pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. pyocyanin, the major metabolite of pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit escherichia coli, proteus spp. and other gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of  p. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. however, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of p. aeruginosa against  a large number of clinical isolates such as escherichia spp., klebsiella spp., and salmonella spp., up to now. for this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of  a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of e. coli, 30 of k. pneumoniae, 30 of s. infantis, 6 of enterobacter cloacae and 9 of proteus mirabilis.

TI  == in vitro pharmacodynamics of piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin alone and in combination against staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the time-kill curve methodology was used to determine the pharmacodynamics of piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam and the combinations piperacillin-ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam. kill curve  studies were performed for piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam at concentrations of 0.25 to 50 times the mics for 13 strains of bacteria: four pseudomonas aeruginosa, three enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella pneumoniae, and three staphylococcus aureus isolates (tazobactam concentrations of 0.5, 4, and 12 micrograms/ml). by using a sigmoid emax model and nonlinear least squares regression, the 50% lethal concentrations and the maximum lethal rates of each agent were determined for each bacterial strain. for piperacillin-ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam, kill curve  studies were performed with concentrations obtained by the fractional maximal effect method (r. c. li, j. j. schentag, and d. e. nix, antimicrob. agents chemother. 37:523-531, 1993) and from individual 50% lethal concentrations and maximum lethal rates. ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam was evaluated only against the four p. aeruginosa strains. interactions between piperacillin and ciprofloxacin were generally additive. at physiologically relevant concentrations of piperacillin and ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin had the highest rates of killing against k. pneumoniae. piperacillin-tazobactam (12 micrograms/ml) had the highest rate of killing against e. cloacae. piperacillin-ciprofloxacin with relatively higher ciprofloxacin concentrations had the greatest killing rates against s. aureus. this combination had significantly higher killing rates than piperacillin (p < 0.002). for all the bacterial strains tested, killing rates by ciprofloxacin were significantly higher than those by piperacillin-tazobactam (4 and 12 micrograms/ml had significantly higher killing rates than piperacillin alone (p < 0.02 and p < 0.004, respectively). the effect of the combination of piperacillin-ciprofloxacin, in which piperacillin concentrations were relatively  higher, was not statistically different from that of piperacillin alone (p > or = 0.71). the combination of ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam achieved greater  killing than other combinations or monotherapies against p. aeruginosa. the reduction in the initial inoculum was 1 to 4 logs greater with ciprofloxacin-piperacillin-tazobactam at 4 and 12 micrograms/ml than with any other agent or combination of agents. on the basis of the additive effects prevalently demonstrated in the in vitro study, the combinations of piperacillin-ciprofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam are rational therapeutic options. greater killing of p. aeruginosa was demonstrated with ciprofloxacin-piperacillin--tazobactam. since treatment failure of p. aeruginosa  pneumonia is a significant problem, clinical studies are warranted.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of fk037: a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == the antibacterial and bactericidal activities and the stability of fk037 to beta-lactamases were investigated and compared with those of cefpirome, flomoxef, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and vancomycin. against clinical isolates of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, fk037 was  less active than vancomycin but more potent than the other drugs tested. among highly methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mic for methicillin: 200 mg/l or higher), none of the strains were highly resistant to fk037 (mic > or = 100 mg/l) unlike the other cephalosporins. with the exception of enterococcus faecalis, fk037 had an activity equipotent to that of cefpirome and far superior to those of flomoxef, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime against other gram-positive clinical isolates. the activity of fk037 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas cepacia was equipotent to that of cefpirome but 2- to 4-fold less active than that of ceftazidime. fk037 inhibited 90% of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter  freundii growth at a concentration of 6.25 mg/l; it was as active as cefpirome and much more active than ceftazidime. against the other gram-negative bacteria tested, fk037 was equipotent to cefpirome and ceftazidime and was more effective  than flomoxef. fk037, like cefpirome, portrayed a high stability to various beta-lactamases except type ii penicillinase and oxyimino-cephalosporinase (cxase). fk037 scored an mic range of 0.013-6.25 mg/l against numerous beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains with the exception of some cxase-producing strains and a cephalosporinase-producing c. freundii; and against strains other than p. aeruginosa fk037 was as active as cefpirome and 2- to 32-fold more active than ceftazidime. fk037 displayed highly potent activities against cephalosporinase-producing e. cloacae, c. freundii and serratia marcescens which were resistant to flomoxef and ceftizoxime. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus and escherichia coli at its mic or higher.

TI  == activity of cefepime against ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacilli using low and high inocula.
AB  == cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that is reported to have enhanced activity against ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacilli. in this study the effects of varying inoculum size on in-vitro susceptibility to cefepime and other selected antimicrobial agents were determined by agar dilution mics and in time-kill studies. among strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 55) and enterobacter spp (n = 56) that had previously been identified as ceftazidime-resistant, 73% and 96% were susceptible to cefepime (mic < or = 16 mg/l), respectively, when tested with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. however, with an  inoculum of 10(7) cfu, 98% and 100% of strains were resistant, respectively. furthermore, the bactericidal activity of cefepime against ceftazidime-resistant  isolates was also inoculum-dependent. in time-kill studies, bactericidal action was obtained only at the lowest concentration of organisms (10(4) cfu/ml). beta-lactamase extracted from an isolate of p. aeruginosa that demonstrated an inoculum effect had a lower affinity for cefepime than for ceftazidime. overall,  cefepime proved to be more resistant to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase. however, differences in kinetics of the beta-lactamase against cefepime or ceftazidime do not appear to be of consequence in determining susceptibility of p. aeruginosa and enterobacter spp. at high bacterial densities, since most strains with chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamase are highly resistant.

TI  == effect of beta-lactamase expression on susceptibility of local isolates of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == during surveillance studies, a total of 66 strains of gram-negative bacilli (28 enterobacter cloacae, 20 serratia marcescens and 18 pseudomonas aeruginosa) with  a reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and amikacin were isolated from documented infections. all isolates were highly susceptible to imipenem and sparfloxacin. beta-lactamase activity was demonstrated in all isolates of e. cloacae and s. marcescens, and in 77% of p. aeruginosa isolates. inducible beta-lactamase activity was detected in 80, 65 and 40% of e. cloacae, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa isolates, respectively, when cefoxitin was used as an inducer. more inducible beta-lactamase producers were observed when imipenem was used as an inducer. isolates of e. cloacae, and to a lesser extent s. marcescens, expressed a wide spectrum of beta-lactamase activities. there was a good correlation between baseline beta-lactamase activity and the respective mic of ceftazidime, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, and to a lesser extent aztreonam in e. cloacae and s. marcescens isolates. only one isolate of e. cloacae demonstrated an extended beta-lactamase activity. the data  suggest that the resistance of e. cloacae and s. marcescens isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics is largely dependent upon hyperproduction of beta-lactamase.

TI  == control-related effective regrowth time and post-antibiotic effect of meropenem on gram-negative bacteria studied by bioluminescence and viable counts.
AB  == a study was performed to compare viable counts and bioluminescence for determining control related effective regrowth time (cert) and postantibiotic effect (pae) on gram-negative bacteria after two hours of exposure to meropenem.  there was a good correlation between bioluminescence and viable counts in determining the cell numbers in growing cultures of escherichia coli. cert was defined as the time required for the resumption of logarithmic growth and an increase of 1 log10 to occur over the pre-exposure inoculum in the test culture minus corresponding time for the control culture. pae and cert were studied on reference strains of enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at 4 x mic of meropenem the certs of these four gram-negative strains were 4.1, 4.9, 4.2, and 3.6 h, respectively, when assayed by bioluminescence. corresponding certs using viable counts were 4.2, 5.0, 5.1 and 3.8 h, respectively. in contrast to this good agreement between the methods in assessing cert, the corresponding paes were highly method dependent. at 4 x mic of meropenem the paes on e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa were 3.9, 4.8, 4.7, and 3.5 h, respectively, when assayed by bioluminescene. however, the corresponding and simultaneously determined viable count paes were -0.4, 0.5, -0.1, and 0.7 h, respectively. the poor correlation between these methods in assessing the pae is caused by greater initial decrease in viability compared with the less prominent initial change in cell density as measured by bioluminescence.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the design of dosage schedules for 12-h cefotaxime alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  == pharmacodynamic principles have provided important tools to evaluate and compare  antimicrobial agents, and well as to guide dosing. for beta-lactams, time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) has surfaced as the most important factor. however, the area under the inhibitory serum concentration time-curve (auic) may be superior when appropriate dosing intervals are selected. although the target time over the mic is unclear in humans even when concentrations remain continuously above the mic, a higher auic predicts better clinical outcome up to  a maximum. this article provides a pharmacodynamic assessment of 1- and 2-g doses of cefotaxime every 12 h. auic24 values and published mic values for common pathogens (grouped into four groups based on mic90) were used to predict organisms suitable for treatment with every-12-h regimes. cefotaxime was inadequate for group 4 organisms including: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acienetobacter sp., and enterococcus sp. organisms such as enterobacter cloacae,  serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and b. fragilis may be suboptimally treated with cefotaxime every 12 h. cefotaxime in doses of 1-2 g every 12 h should be useful in patients with normal renal function infected with organisms having mics < 0.5 microgram/ml. this regimen should obtain auic24 values > 125 and ensure adequate time above the mic. in patients with impaired renal function, because of a longer half-life and higher area under the curve, pathogens with mic values in the 0.5-2 micrograms/ml range may be treated with cefotaxime every 12 h while maintaining auics > 125. data are also presented for cefotaxime 2 g every 8 h alone and in combination with ofloxacin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == pharmacodynamic effects of meropenem on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro initial killing and post-antibiotic effect (pae) of meropenem on five gram-negative reference strains were evaluated by bioluminescence assay of bacterial adenosine triphosphate (atp) and viable count. morphology studies were  performed in parallel. meropenem showed concentration-dependent long (2-5 h) paes on enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens when assayed by bioluminescence and induced spheroplasts at almost all concentrations. the bioluminescence paes reached a maximum response at 4 x mic. these paes of meropenem on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens were longer than corresponding paes of imipenem shown in previous studies. the higher affinity of meropenem than imipenem for pbp 3 might explain the longer paes obtained with meropenem. however, there was only a very short pae, no pae or even a negative pae when viable count was used as the initial value for the pae calculation. a strong initial decrease in viability but a less pronounced change in intracellular atp was registered. since this initial change in cell numbers is the initial value for the pae calculation, the length of pae was highly method dependent. in summary, a strong initial killing and no pae were shown using viable count as the initial value for the pae calculation, but a weak initial killing and long paes were shown when bioluminescence was used throughout the experiments.

TI  == characterization of an lysr family protein, smer from serratia marcescens s6, its effect on expression of the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase sme-1, and comparison of this regulator with other beta-lactamase regulators.
AB  == serratia marcescens s6 produces a chromosomally encoded carbapenem-hydrolyzing class a beta-lactamase, sme-1 (t. naas, l. vandel, w. sougakoff, d. m. livermore, and p. nordmann, antimicrob. agents chemother. 38:1262-1270, 1994). upstream from smea we identified a second open reading frame (embl accession number z30237). this encodes a 33.1-kda protein, smer, which has a high degree of homology with nmcr, the lysr regulatory protein of the only other sequenced carbapenem-hydrolyzing class a beta-lactamase, nmca from enterobacter cloacae nor-1. it is weakly related to ampr of the chromosomal cephalosporinase regulatory systems described in e. cloacae, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter  freundii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and is very weakly related to other lysr-type regulators of class a beta-lactamases. smer is a weakly positive regulator for sme-1 expression in the absence of or in the presence of beta-lactam inducers. the -35 and -10 regions of smer are in the opposite orientations and are face-to-face relative to the smea promoter. smer acts similarly to nmcr and not as the ampr regulators described for class c beta-lactamase systems. smer is a weak inducer in the absence or presence of beta-lactams. as was found for the ampc-ampr and nmca-nmcr systems, a putative smer-binding site was present upstream from the beta-lactamase gene promoter regions. beta-galactosidase activity from a smer-lacz translational fusion was expressed constitutively and decreased in the presence of smer from a coresident  plasmid, suggesting that smer is autogeneously controlled. finally, beta-lactams  did not affect the expression of smer, which is the second regulator of a class a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase to be identified.

TI  == investigation of helicobacter pylori ascorbic acid oxidating activity.
AB  == helicobacter pylori sonicate was shown to oxidize ascorbic acid. ascorbic acid oxidation was determined by chromatography combined with electrochemical detection. water soluble ascorbic acid oxidase activity was rather independent of ph with a ph optimum around 2. by gel filtration the oxidizing activity co-eluted with an absorbency peak at 408 nm. the relative molecular mass (mr) was approximately 14,000. it is suggested that this oxidating activity was caused by  a cytochrome c-like molecule. ascorbic acid oxidating activity could also be extracted from bacterial membranes by detergents. gel filtration showed several forms, the major one with a mr = 19,000. ph optimum was 6-7. other oxidase-positive bacterial strains like campylobacter coli, enterobacter cloacae  and pseudomonas aeruginosa could degrade ascorbic acid. since ascorbic acid oxidation by helicobacter pylori whole bacterial lysates has a ph optimum in the  acidic range corresponding to ph in gastric fluid, the activity of the cytochrome c-like water soluble oxidant of helicobacter pylori seems to be primarily important for the destruction of ascorbic acid in the gastric juice of infected patients.

AB  == the in vitro activities of the carbapenem bms-181139 were determined in comparison with those of imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. bms-181139 was the most active against species of pseudomonas and related genera alteromonas and burkholderia, with mics for 147 of 149 isolates of < 4 micrograms/ml. of 22 imipenem-resistant (mic > 8 micrograms/ml) p. aeruginosa strains, only 1 required an mic of bms-181139 of > 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 14 requiring the same meropenem mic. bms-181139 was the most active carbapenem against the majority of other gram-negative species except members of the tribe proteeae, against which meropenem was more active. although imipenem was more active against gram-positive species, bms-18139 mics at which 90% of strain tested were inhibited were < 1 microgram/ml for these species. bms-181139 was generally active against isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin or broad-spectrum cephalosporins, including those containing plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases or high levels of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases, as well as anaerobes except clostridium difficile. inoculum effects were noted for all three carbapenems against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens but  not escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or staphylococcus aureus. bms-181139's inoculum effect tended to be more marked. bms-181139 exhibited bactericidal activity at the mic for some strains and up to four to eight times the mic for others. the postantibiotic effect of bms-181139 was equal to or less  than that of imipenem and, like meropenem, exhibited intraspecies variability. bms-181139 was 30-fold more stable than imipenem and 7-fold more stable than meropenem to hydrolysis by hog kidney dehydropeptidase.

TI  == bacterial resistance to carbapenems.
AB  == the carbapenems have the broadest spectra of all beta-lactams but resistance still occurs, caused by target modification, impermeability or beta-lactamase production. target modification or replacement is important in methicillin-resistant staphylococci, e. faecium and some pneumococci. these organisms present the greatest current threat to carbapenem efficacy. impermeability to carbapenems arises in p. aeruginosa mutants, where it is contingent on loss of d2 outer membrane protein, a minor porin. this resistance functions only if the pseudomonas retains its chromosomal group 1 beta-lactamase, and so reflects the interplay of impermeability and hydrolysis rather than impermeability alone; nevertheless porin loss is the critical change that engenders resistance. resistance based on impermeability coupled to a group 1 beta-lactamase has also been described in e. cloacae, but demands loss of a major porin and is much rarer and less stable than in p. aeruginosa. although group 1 beta-lactamases contribute to resistance in these organisms, they have only feeble carbapenemase activity. chromosomal beta-lactamases with potent carbapenemase activity occur in most or all x. maltophilia, a. hydrophila and f.  odoratum isolates. these enzymes, which cause carbapenem resistance when expressed copiously, are all zinc-dependent. zinc carbapenemases also are a concern in b. fragilis, where they are encoded by the chromosomal dna of c. 3% of isolates, though expressed by only 1%. carbapenemases are extremely rare outside  these species. nevertheless, a plasmidic zinc carbapenemase was reported from one p. aeruginosa isolate and from several s. marcescens. further carbapenemases, some not zinc-dependent, are known from a tiny numbers of serratia, enterobacter, and acinetobacter isolates. despite these various modes of resistance, carbapenems have retained their efficacy far better than have expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. whether this advantage will be retained indefinitely is uncertain. if resistance does become more prevalent it may be possible to derivatize the carbapenems so as to extend their activity. there is already interest in the design of carbapenems that bind beta-lactam-resistant pbps and, to an extent, in the development of carbapenemase inhibitors.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

TI  == the microbial flora in venous leg ulcers without clinical signs of infection. repeated culture using a validated standardised microbiological technique.
AB  == the change of ulcer size in relation to the presence of species and quantities of microorganisms was analysed in 58 patients with venous leg ulcers, all without clinical signs of infection. microbiological samples were taken on the day of inclusion and then repeated 4 times at monthly intervals or until the ulcer had healed or was too small to be cultured from. there was growth of microorganisms in all ulcers, and the numbers were below 10(4) per mm2 of ulcer surface in all cases. no correlation was found between ulcer size change and the species and amounts of microorganisms. sixty-nine species were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was found in 88%, enterococcus faecalis in 74%, enterobacter cloacae and peptococcus magnus in 29%, and fungi in 11% of the samples. one or more obligate  anaerobe species was found in 41% of the samples and in half of the ulcers and constituted 62% of all bacterial species. the colonising ulcer flora was markedly constant over time in the individual ulcers regardless of change in size. resident bacterial species were found in 57 of the 58 ulcers. if all samples were considered, the microorganisms were associated with not more than one fifth of the variability in healing rate, as shown by linear multiple regression analysis. the same species of microorganisms were found in ulcers that decreased (or healed) and in those that increased in size. although an association between the  microorganisms and ulcer healing could not be ruled out in this study, there seems to be no indication for routinely performed culture in the absence of clinical signs of infection in venous leg ulcers.

TI  == disinfection of dental stone casts: antimicrobial effects and physical property alterations.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfecting solutions incorporated into dental stone casts against a standard and representative group of microorganisms and to note changes in the physical properties of the casts. methods: irreversible hydrocolloid impressions were contaminated individually with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, actinobacter calcoaceticus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium phlei and candida albicans. four  readily available disinfecting solutions (glutaraldehyde, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite) were added to the die stone mix used to pour up the impressions. the set cast surfaces were swabbed at 1 h and 24 h, the  samples plated on agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and 3 d for m. phlei. subsequently, colony forming units were counted. the physical properties assessed were setting time, setting expansion, compressive strength, detail reproduction and delayed expansion of the stone. results: only glutaraldehyde and povidone-iodine killed all contaminating microorganisms within 1 h, while the 1:5 dilution of sodium hypochlorite solution was equally effective after 24 h. two percent glutaraldehyde was the most effective disinfectant with the least adverse effects on the physical properties of the set cast. although povidone-iodine caused a decrease in the compressive strength of the set cast, it can be considered to be a sound alternative. significance: this study supports the concept of incorporating disinfectants into model stone as a standard operating procedure for impressions of unknown history and, most sensibly, all dental impressions.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sucralfate versus aluminum chloride in simulated gastric fluid.
AB  == studies have previously demonstrated that sucralfate possesses intrinsic antibacterial activity. this study was designed to indirectly assess whether aluminum is the active antibacterial component of sucralfate and to further evaluate factors that may influence this agent's antibacterial activity. utilizing an in vitro model, the antibacterial activity of sucralfate, an equivalent quantity of aluminum in the form of aluminum chloride, and a control were compared. in addition, the influences of bacterial species (enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa), time (0-24 h) and environmental ph (3,5,7) on the agents' antibacterial activities were evaluated. equivalent quantities of  aluminum, as either sucralfate or aluminum chloride, were added to two of three flasks containing approximately 10(5) cfu/ml of bacteria in ph-adjusted simulated gastric fluid. the third flask served as a control. samples were obtained over 24 h, diluted and subcultured onto agar plates. the experiments demonstrated that bacterial growth was influenced by ph, time and treatment (aluminum chloride or sucralfate). regardless of ph or bacterial species, bacterial death occurred within 20 min following the addition of aluminum chloride. in contrast, bacterial death following the addition of sucralfate was more variable and appeared to be ph dependent. in conclusion, sucralfate and aluminum chloride both possess antibacterial activity, even at ph values that normally support bacterial growth  in gastric fluid. although differences in the antibacterial activity of the two agents may in part be related to drug-induced changes in ph, these differences also support data suggesting that aluminum release from sucralfate is incomplete  and is dependent on ph.

TI  == improvement of outer membrane-permeabilizing and lipopolysaccharide-binding activities of an antimicrobial cationic peptide by c-terminal modification.
AB  == antimicrobial cationic peptides have been discovered in many different organisms  and often possess a broad range of activity. in this study, we investigated the mechanisms of actions of melittin and two synthetic peptides, ceme (a cecropin-melittin hybrid) and cema, against gram-negative bacteria. cema was produced by recombinant dna procedures and is an analog of ceme with a modified c terminus resulting in two additional positive charges. all three peptides showed  good antimicrobial activity against four different gram-negative bacteria, but only cema was able to somewhat augment the activity of some conventional antibiotics in synergy studies. studies using the bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae showed that the peptides all possessed the ability to permeabilize bacterial outer membranes to the hydrophobic fluorophor 1-n-phenylnaphthylamine and the protein lysozyme, with cema being the most active. cema also had the strongest relative binding affinity for bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). these data collectively indicated that these peptides all cross the outer membrane by the self-promoted uptake pathway and that cema is the peptide most effective at accessing this pathway.

TI  == resistance of bacterial strains to dry conditions: use of anhydrous silica gel in a desiccation model system.
AB  == the viability of 18 bacterial strains desiccated on anhydrous silica gel and stored at a temperature of 22 degrees c for at least 3 months was determined. according to their stability in the dried state, these strains could be classified into three typical groups. group 1, containing gram-positive strains and salmonella serotypes, was marked by a very slow decrease of the concentration of culturable cells from day 14 on (respectively day 21 for salmonella thompson). the rate of decrease expressed as regression coefficient (b) ranged from -0.000389 to -0.00521 log (cfp ml-1) per d. the group 2 strains enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli did not reach a comparable slow decrease in the dry  material within the indicated time period. regression coefficients were respectively -0.04406 and -0.03412 log (cfp ml-1) per d. the reciprocal values -(1/b) were respectively 23 d per log (cfp ml-1) and 29 d per log (cfp ml-1), indicating the time periods in which a reduction of 1 log unit of culturable cells occurred. group 3 strains pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and  aer. sobria were marked by a significant susceptibility to cell damage caused during desiccation and reconstitution. a high initial decrease (id) of the concentration of culturable organisms seems to be a characteristic property of these bacterial strains: culturable organisms could not be detected after storage for 1 d (aer. hydrophila, aer. sobria) or 7 d (ps. aeruginosa). the wide range of resistance of the different bacterial strains tested indicated that the silica gel model system is a suitable tool for microbiological challenge tests to investigate the survival of micro-organisms exposed to desiccation and their stability in dry materials.

AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae ba32, a clinical isolate from buenos aires, argentina, was  found to produce a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase (fox-1) which conferred resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and cephamycins. resistance could be  transferred by conjugation or transformation into escherichia coli k-12 via a 48.5-kb plasmid (pglk1) that produced two fox-1 molecular variants with isoelectric points of 6.8 and 7.2 and apparent molecular sizes of 37 and 35 kda,  respectively. the kinetic study revealed that the two variants had very similar substrate and inhibition profiles. these values resemble those of chromosomally mediated class c (group 1) cephalosporinases. the structural gene of fox-1 (blafox-1) was cloned into a 2,270-bp psti-psti fragment and was expressed in e.  coli tg1. the deduced 382-amino-acid sequence of fox-1 exhibited a high degree of similarity with chromosomally encoded ampc beta-lactamases of pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, and citrobacter freundii. these findings suggest that fox-1 is a plasmid-mediated ampc-type beta-lactamase that is encoded by a single gene and that has two molecular variants.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == the pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  == we examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to nagasaki university hospital during the past 15 years. a total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. the rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage i: 6.3%, stage ii: 15.9%, stage iii: 27.9%, and  stage iv: 33.8%). deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.

TI  == catheter related bacterial infections mimic reactions to exogenous pyrogens during hemodialysis.
AB  == pyrogenic reactions are characterized by fever, chills, hypotension, or a combination of these developing during or shortly after hemodialysis in a previously asymptomatic patient. the temporal association with treatment implicates exposure of the patient's blood to bacterial pyrogens from contaminated dialysate or a reused dialyzer. routine body temperature monitoring  is recommended to detect these exposures. the current study was prompted by the appearance of several symptomatic febrile episodes in patients who were asymptomatic and afebrile before treatment with high-flux hemodialysis. during a  6 month period, temperatures were measured with a digital oral thermometer before and after 9,605 high-flux hemodialyses in 163 patients. elevations above 100 degrees f (37.8 degrees c) were observed during or after 33 dialyses in 15 patients. in 18 of these dialyses, the temperature was also elevated before treatment began. four patients who had no symptoms or fever before dialysis accounted for febrile reactions during 11 of the remaining 15 dialysis treatments. fever was accompanied by rigors during most of the episodes. subsequent blood cultures grew enterococcus faecalis (two), enterobacter cloacae  (two), and pseudomonas aeruginosa and cepacia (one). all four patients had indwelling silastic double lumen venous catheters (permcaths), all responded to intravenous antibiotics, and all required eventual removal of the catheter. the apparent precipitation of sepsis by dialysis indicates that shear forces caused by high pulsatile blood flow through the catheter may dislodge organisms that have colonized the lumen. intraluminal instillation of antibiotics is suggested as a preventative measure.

AB  == the prevalence of possible cross-transmission of selected bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci) among infected patients was evaluated in  five intensive care units (icus) over 6 months. a total of 284 isolates from clinical specimens were typed by plasmid profile analysis (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae), restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid dna (s. aureus), and/or pulse-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal dna (p. aeruginosa, enterococci, s. aureus, and other bacteria without plasmid dna). by typing criteria, only 13% of the 177 isolates obtained after > 2 days in an icu were classified as possibly cross-transmitted. many patients whose cultures yielded bacteria of an identical type may have been the sources rather than the recipients of these organisms. episodes of possible cross-transmission were scattered among all icus, usually affected only two patients, and were associated with most bacterial species. these data suggest that endemic bacterial cross-transmission in icus is relatively infrequent and that cross-transmitted bacteria are not common causes of endemic icu-related nosocomial infections.

AB  == the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19)  the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of  different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined  exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces  of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == inhibitory effect of clindamycin on production of beta-lactamase in beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.

TI  == [bacterial resistance to antibiotics in the czech republic. the working group for monitoring resistance in the czech republic].
AB  == in 1991 the authors made an investigation on the resistance of clinically important bacteria. seventeen antibiotic centres in the czech republic participated in the investigation. the resistance to antibiotics of 32,567 strains of twelve bacterial species isolated from hospitalized patients depends on 1. the type of bacteria and antibiotics, 2. the source (specimen of pathological material) and 3. the locality (hospital). the resistance of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin with the exception of one hospital is not more than 6%, in rare instances also resistance to vancomycin was encountered. the frequency of resistance of gram-negative rods to so-called reserve antibiotics (cephalosporins of the third generation, quinolones and amikacin) depends markedly on the type of bacteria, being highest in typical causal agents of hospital infections--enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, providencia rettgeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa. with the exception of cephalosporins the resistance of gram-negative rods and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urine is much greater than in strains from other clinical materials. the frequency of resistance in faculty hospitals which concentrate patients with more serious diseases is high, the highest resistance was, however, recorded in the north bohemian area--in pneumococci against penicillin (13%) and in haemophili against  ampicillin (17%). every hospital is a closed ecological niche with a typical bacterial population and resistance rate. a competent estimate of an adequate and probably effective antibiotic for immediate initiation of treatment of an urgent  infection can thus be made only by somebody with close and steady knowledge of the state of resistance in a given hospital.

TI  == genetics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == bacteria have adapted to the introduction of aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime,  ceftriaxone and other oxyimino-beta-lactams by altering existing plasmid-mediated class a and class d beta-lactamases so as to expand their spectrum of activity. in the tem and shv families of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, relative activity toward oxyimino-substrates increases with the number of amino acid substitutions but at the price of lowered intrinsic efficiency, so that compensatory up-promoter events are often associated with increased enzyme expression. another new mechanism of resistance is the capture on plasmids of normally chromosomal genes from enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which upon transfer can provide klebsiella pneumoniae or  escherichia coli with resistance to alpha-methoxy-beta-lactams, such as cefoxitin or cefotetan, as well as to oxyimino-beta-lactams.

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == [ciprofloxacin resistance in gram negative bacilli. epidemiologic aspects].
AB  == background: the aim of the present was to study the resistance to ciprofloxacin (cip) in gram negative bacilli (april 1990-march 1992) and to determine the temporary distribution of the resistant strains by species, samples and departments. methods: seven thousand four hundred seventy-eight samples were studied. the identification and determination of the sensitivity was performed by the pasco (difco) system. haemophilus spp. and campylobacter spp. were excluded from the study. the microorganisms with cim 2 mg/l were considered as resistant (cipr). results: four hundred eighty-one cipr isolations were identified (6.4%).  with regard to the percentage of resistant strains, the species with the highest  were: providencia stuartii (50%); pseudomonas cepacia (44.4%); xanthomonas maltophilia (26.9%); acinetobacter baumannii (25.8%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%); citrobacter freundii (12.5%); serratia marcescens (8.4%); enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and escherichia coli (4.3%). with respect to the absolute number of resistant strains, the most frequent resistant strains were: p. aeruginosa (205), e. coli (144), and a. baumannii (41). isolation of e. coli and a. baumannii cipr increased over the study period. forty-four point five percent of  the e. coli cipr were of extrahospitalary origin; most of the a. baumannii (92.9%) and p. aeruginosa (77.6%) in contrast were of intrahospitalary origin. conclusions: p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and a. baumannii are the most frequently resistant species. the frequency of isolation of resistant strains of e. coli and a. baumannii significantly increased (p < 0.001) over the two years of the study.

TI  == early bacterial infections in lung transplant recipients.
AB  == early bacterial pulmonary infections within 2 weeks after lung transplantation were studied in 29 patients undergoing surgery between december 1989 and may 1992. suspected pulmonary infections occurred in 11 patients (38 percent). the most common bacterial organisms isolated were klebsiella pneumoniae (45 percent;  5/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (36 percent; 4/11), escherichia coli (27 percent; 3/11), staphylococcus aureus (18 percent; 2/11), and enterobacter cloacae (18 percent; 2/11). the mortality due to infection was 3 percent (1/29) in the early  postoperative period. none of the following variables was found to be of prognostic significance: positive donor cultures, ischemic time of the graft, use of cardiopulmonary bypass, number of courses of methylprednisolone for acute rejection, duration of postoperative intubation, and type of surgical procedure.  the presence of infection in the early postoperative period did not influence long-term survival. in the absence of prognostic parameters, prompt adjustment of antibiotic therapy to the results of antibiograms remains the most important therapeutic step in the management of infections in the early postoperative period after lung transplantation.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical gram-positive  and gram-negative isolates. cefepime was active at low concentrations (mic50 values < or = 0.06 mg/l and mic90 values < or = 0.12 mg/l) against non-cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.). for klebsiella pneumoniae, mics were between 0.016 and 16 mg/l; the highest mic values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. against enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing enterobacter cloacae, mics were < or = 0.5 mg/l, but mics against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. ticarcillin-sensitive strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/l, while cefepime mics were 8-64 mg/l for strains resistant to ticarcillin. the cefepime mic50 value for haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/l. against methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus, cefepime mics were 0.5-16 mg/l; mics against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/l). against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime mic values were 0.03-16 mg/l; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains  were 2-128 mg/l. streptococci (groups a, c and g) were sensitive to cefepime with mics ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/l (mic50, 0.03 mg/l; mic90, 0.25 mg/l). the activity of cefepime against group b streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with mic50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively, and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. most enterococci and all listeria monocytogenes strains had mics > or = 32 mg/l.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == cefepime, a new cephalosporin which has a broad-spectrum of activity was tested in vitro against 1961 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates obtained  from european hospitals. cefepime was highly active against gram-negative organisms, inhibiting over 94% of strains tested. the overall susceptibility rate for cefepime against all isolates was 81%. cefepime was more active than any of the third-generation cephalosporins tested against species capable of producing type i beta-lactamases, e.g. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes. the activity of cefepime against pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of ceftazidime and substantially greater than those of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. all cephalosporins except ceftazidime exhibited high  activity against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus but poor activity  was observed against methicillin-resistant strains. overall susceptibility to cefepime is lower in europe than it is in north america.

TI  == in-vitro activities of cefepime against enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == infections caused by resistant bacterial pathogens such as citrobacter freundii,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa have become  an increasing problem with respect to therapy in large medical centres in korea.  the mics of cefepime for aerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated during 1991, mostly from in-patients in a hospital in seoul, were determined by the agar dilution method and compared with those of several other antimicrobials. of the agents tested, cefepime had the lowest mic90s for c. freundii and e. cloacae (0.12 and 8 mg/l, respectively). the mic90s of cefepime and amikacin (both 8 mg/l) were the lowest for s. marcescens. the mic90s of cefepime, ceftazidime and  doxycycline (all 32 mg/l) were the lowest for acinetobacter anitratus. for p. aeruginosa, the mic90 was relatively high (32 mg/l) but still the lowest of the antimicrobials tested. of the cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae isolates studied, only 7% were resistant to cefepime, while 100%, 96% and 89% were resistant to ceftazidime, ceftizoxime and cefuzonam, respectively. similarly, only 6% of gentamicin-resistant isolates were resistant to cefepime, compared with 91%, 72%, 69% and 63% to ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, cefuzonam and cefotaxime, respectively.  in conclusion, isolates from korean patients are often resistant to several antimicrobial agents. however, based on the results of this study, cefepime may be very useful as treatment for patients with nosocomial infections caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including those which are resistant to most of the third-generation cephalosporins and gentamicin.

TI  == a non-comparative, multicentre study of cefepime in the treatment of serious bacterial infections.
AB  == multi-resistant strains of gram-negative bacteria are rapidly emerging as a frequent cause of serious bacterial infection in the hospital environment. effective treatment must include an antibiotic with activity against these organisms. in an open multicentre study, cefepime was evaluated as empirical therapy in 156 hospitalized patients (mean age 57 years) with serious infection of the urinary tract (n = 43), lower respiratory tract (n = 101) and skin and soft tissue (n = 12). in 18 patients, septicaemia/bacteraemia was also diagnosed. cefepime, 2 g bd, was administered for a maximum of 16 days (mean 8). of 98 pathogens isolated, 75 were gram-negative and 23 were gram-positive species. ninety-four of the pathogens were susceptible to cefepime, including multi-resistant isolates such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. the overall clinical cure rate, excluding septicaemia/bacteraemia, was 92% (94/102); the corresponding bacterial eradication rate was 95% (52/55). in patients with septicaemia/bacteraemia, the clinical cure rate was 87% (13/15) despite eradication of 100% (11/11) of the assessable pathogens. cefepime was well-tolerated, although 14 (9%) patients experienced local intolerance at the infusion site. other drug-related adverse events were reported in six (4%) patients and included diarrhoea, pruritus, rash and urticaria. cefepime is safe and effective as empirical treatment for serious infections commonly found in the hospital setting. clinical cure and bacterial eradication can be achieved with a  convenient bd dosing schedule.

TI  == low-dosage cefepime as treatment for serious bacterial infections.
AB  == since infection develops in significant numbers of hospitalized patients, the problem of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is of increasing concern. we evaluated the efficacy of cefepime 1 g bd as treatment for acute, moderately severe bacterial infection in 239 hospitalized patients (mean age 60 years). of these patients, 204 were evaluated clinically for urinary tract infection (uti) (n = 90), lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) (n = 70), skin and soft tissue infection (s/sti) (n = 12) and bacteraemia which was associated with either uti or lrti (n = 32) but not included in the previously mentioned uti and lrti groups. amongst the pathogens isolated (36 gram-positive, 150 gram-negative), the most predominant species were escherichia coli in uti and bacteraemia (n = 81), streptococcus pneumoniae in lrti and bacteraemia (n = 23),  haemophilus influenzae in lrti (n = 16), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and enterobacter cloacae (n = 2) in s/sti. the mean duration of treatment was 8.5 days and was the same for the 204 clinically evaluable patients. overall, the clinical cure rate for cefepime was 94% (191/204). pathogen eradication was achieved in 93% (185/199) of infections. of the patients with associated bacteraemia, the clinical cure rate was 97% (31/32) and 94% (16/17) of the pathogens were eradicated. cefepime therapy was well-tolerated. treatment was discontinued in eight patients (3%) because of local intolerance and in five patients (2%) because of drug-related adverse events (rash, headache and pruritus). cefepime 1 g bd is as safe and effective as other parenteral cephalosporins for the treatment of acute bacterial uti, lrti and s/sti, including those cases with associated bacteraemia. the bd dosing schedule and reported lack of cross-resistance with other cephalosporins against some species  of aerobic gram-negative bacilli make cefepime an attractive treatment option in  hospitalized patients.

TI  == [bacterial reducing qualities of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. i. contamination and sedimentation in humid and dry conditions].
AB  == in this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide b" and "high-grade steel") were tested. the surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus). after defined exposure times the  survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "guidelines of the german society of hygiene and microbiology". additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. in further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. after defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. the results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. humidity and only single contamination cause  a reduction of bacteria. reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than  reduction of gram-positive bacteria. enterococcus faecium shows the highest, pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin following multiple oral doses in healthy volunteers.
AB  == fourteen adult males participated in a randomized three-way crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers (sbts) of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen a), 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen b), and 400 mg of ofloxacin (regimen c) administered every 12 h for seven doses. mean steady-state  peak concentrations in serum for regimens a, b, and c were 3.0, 4.4, and 6.5 micrograms/ml, respectively (p < 0.01, all comparisons) and mean half-lives were  4.5, 4.3, and 6.5 h, respectively (p < 0.05, c versus a and b). mean steady-state areas under the concentration-time curve were 14.1, 21.1, and 48.1 micrograms/h/ml for regimens a, b, and c, respectively (p < 0.05, all comparisons). sbts were determined at different times postdose for three isolates each of streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. mean steady-state peak sbts for regimens a, b, and c, respectively, were as follows: s. pneumoniae, < 1:2, 1:8, 1:8, s. aureus, 1:16, 1:16, 1:16; e. coli, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; e. cloacae, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; p. aeruginosa, 1:8, 1:8, 1:2. these  differences in sbts within each genus were statistically significant. the majority of predicted sbts were within one dilution of measured sbts. areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for e. coli, e. cloacae, and p. aeruginosa were significantly higher for ciprofloxacin; areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for s. pneumoniae and s. aureus were significantly greater for ofloxacin. ofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in serum than ciprofloxacin,  but differences in in vitro activity were a more important determinant of sbts.

TI  == in vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  == although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. we therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative  rods against antibiotics. using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for port-a-cath-systems. organisms were obtained from  the american type culture collection (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae). all organisms but klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated pseudomonas. after 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with  various antimicrobial agents. the following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective mics of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. e. coli was found  to be the most susceptible organism. these in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.

TI  == emergence of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacilli causing bacteremia during therapy.
AB  == treatment of serious infections caused by gram-negative bacilli with beta-lactam  antimicrobial agents can induce class i beta-lactamase production. this phenomenon can result in resistant microorganisms, and has been postulated to be  a cause of therapeutic failure. the charts of patients bacteremic with pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and providencia species (n = 120) during a 3-year period were reviewed to determine how common the emergence of resistance was, and to determine if in vitro susceptibility testing was a reliable therapeutic guide. emergence of resistance was believed to occur when a subsequent bacteremic isolate showed at least a fourfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentration accompanied by a change of interpretive susceptibility category. in the group of  patients who survived at least 48 hours that received beta-lactam therapy (n = 76), one case of emergence of resistance was identified (1.3%). emergence of resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents did not commonly cause therapeutic failure at our institution, and susceptibility testing of gram-negative bacilli by usual methods was a reliable guide to antimicrobial therapy.

AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout japan from september to december in both 1989 and 1990. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (ipm) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to ipm and aminoglycosides. bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to ipm. ipm had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == nosocomial infections in intensive care units: an overview of their epidemiology, outcome, and prevention.
AB  == among all hospitalized patients, icu patients are at greatest risk for both endemic and epidemic nosocomial infections. the highest infection rates are seen  in surgical, burn, trauma, and neonatal icus. acquisition of infection is a major determinant of mortality in icus, and prolongs the length of icu stay. predominant pathogens include pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and candida spp. they are more likely to be resistant to antimicrobial agents than are isolates from elsewhere in the hospital. exposure to invasive medical devices is the predominant risk factor for infection, and strategies to prevent infection are aimed at reducing microbial colonization on and around devices. improvements in technology, such as coating devices with antimicrobial agents, have been shown to be efficacious in preventing infection. handwashing, particularly with antiseptic soaps, remains the cornerstone of infection control in the icu.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide profile typing as a technique for comparative typing of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we have applied the technique of lipopolysaccharide (lps) profiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to the typing of 124 isolates  of 12 gram-negative species from suspected outbreaks of infection. lps was prepared by proteinase k digestion or micro-phenol-water extraction. a total of 11 of the 12 species gave clear ladder band profiles, the exception being acinetobacter baumannii. when compared with conventional typing for enterobacter  cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, lps profile type alone  was sufficient to allow relatedness or distinguishability of isolates to be established, and this was corroborated by serotype and phage type data. serologically nontypeable isolates invariably lacked o repeating units and thus could not be classified by their silver stain profile. we conclude that lps profiling is useful for the epidemiological investigation of small clusters of isolates in order to determine whether or not cross-infection between patients has occurred.

TI  == the pseudomonas cepacia 249 chromosomal penicillinase is a member of the ampc family of chromosomal beta-lactamases.
AB  == pseudomonas cepacia 249 produces an inducible beta-lactamase with penicillinase activity. the nucleotide sequence of the pena gene, which encodes this beta-lactamase, was determined and found to include regions with a significant homology to the ampc-encoded beta-lactamases of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the predicted amino acid sequence  of the pena beta-lactamase contained 17 amino acids immediately preceding the putative active-site serine which were highly conserved among the enzymes of the  ampc family. although the pena-coding sequence had a total gc content of 60%, the predicted codon usage was more characteristic of escherichia coli ampc-encoded beta-lactamase, with 53% of the codons having g or c in the third position, in contrast to the values for the p. aeruginosa ampc (88.5%) or pseudomonas cepacia  (88 to 92%) metabolic genes. the inducible expression of pena can be regulated by the e. coli gene product ampd. a putative p. cepacia ampr homolog was associated  with the positive regulation of both enterobacter cloacae ampc and p. cepacia pena expression, as confirmed by gel retardation studies. the e. cloacae ampr did not regulate pena expression. thus, by homology studies, codon usage, and genetic analysis, the p. cepacia pena beta-lactamase appears to have been acquired from members of the family enterobacteriaceae and belongs to the class c group of beta-lactamases.

TI  == effect of antibiotics on endotoxin release from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotics may inhibit bacterial growth or may kill bacteria by inhibiting cell  wall synthesis or protein synthesis. the amount of endotoxin released during antibiotic action has been found to be clinically important. nine antibiotics, representing seven classes, were studied for the amounts of endotoxin released during their action on susceptible strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. staphylococcus aureus, which produces no endotoxin, was used as a control organism. aztreonam induced the highest release of endotoxin, whereas other antibiotics such as imipenem and the quinolones induced the lowest release of endotoxin. although the quantities of endotoxin released are not easily explained from the established mechanisms of antibiotic action, our findings may have implications for therapy of the acutely ill, septic patient in whom release of large quantities of endotoxin may be catastrophic.

TI  == focused microbiologic surveillance by specific hospital unit: practical application and clinical utility.
AB  == focused microbiologic surveillance by specific hospital intensive care units (icus) revealed important differences in the occurrence of pathogens among units  and at different times. moreover, there were striking differences between the antibiogram summaries from certain icus and those from the hospital as a whole. accordingly, an ongoing focused microbiologic surveillance was conducted for hospital icus to define unit-specific problems more clearly. to apply these data  practically, results of focused surveillance were given to the icu medical directors. the directors were able to institute unit-specific modifications of antimicrobial usage based upon the prevalent pathogens and their susceptibility patterns within each unit. after 1 year of this approach, the susceptibility patterns of pseudomonas aeruginosa to imipenem and other antipseudomonal beta-lactam agents were improved in a number of icus that had previously noted resistance problems of several years' duration. susceptibility of p aeruginosa was markedly improved in the medical icu. the susceptibility patterns of enterobacter cloacae were less affected, if at all. a review of antimicrobial use revealed that the use of most antipseudomonal agents in the medical icu had decreased by approximately 50% or more. it is concluded that modification of antimicrobial use in icus based on focused microbiologic surveillance is a promising way to detect and minimize problems with resistance.

TI  == importance of beta-lactamase induction.
AB  == induction of an enzyme is a temporary phenomenon in which the rate of enzyme synthesis is greatly increased in response to the presence of an inducer in the environment. induction of beta-lactamase synthesis is important for the resistance of staphylococci to penicillins since the drug both induces synthesis  of the enzyme and is hydrolysed by it. similarly, some compounds both strongly induce and are hydrolysed by the chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacilli (e.g. amoxicillin and cefoxitin for enterobacter cloacae).  other compounds (e.g. piperacillin and cefotaxime) although labile are poor inducers, so that in the case of these drugs the phenomenon of induction is not important but the presence of the enzyme is, since resistant mutants with genetically derepressed synthesis of the enzyme can emerge. induction can also be important when a strong inducer is present with a poor inducer and antagonises the activity of the latter.

AB  == light microscopy and electron microscopy studies with enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of p-aminobenzoic acid indicate that p-aminobenzoic  acid may have a direct or indirect effect on the cell walls. the morphological effects of p-aminobenzoic acid varied with different bacterial species. e. cloacae grown in the presence of p-aminobenzoic acid produced filaments while p.  aeruginosa cells were elongated and had thicker peripheral cell walls. s. aureus  had increased overall cell size and thicker transverse cell walls.

AB  == e1077, a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum and potent antibacterial activity, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with those of cefpirome, cefuzonam, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime. e1077 showed broad in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, e1077 was as active as cefpirome; the mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) was 1.0 microgram/ml. against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, e1077 was less active (mic90, 64 micrograms/ml). for enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, e1077 was fourfold more active than cefpirome, with mic90s of 1.0 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. for proteus vulgaris, the mic90 of e1077 was 32 micrograms/ml, which was fourfold greater than that of cefpirome. against other gram-negative strains tested, the in vitro activity of e1077 was comparable to that of cefpirome. the broad antibacterial spectrum of e1077 was reflected by its in vivo efficacy against experimental septicemia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. against s. aureus 90 and p. aeruginosa  e7, e1077 had activity superior to those of the reference compounds; against most other bacterial strains, the efficacy of e1077 was similar to that of cefpirome.  levels of e1077 in plasma and tissue of mice were studied. at 15 min after a single subcutaneous administration, e1077 displayed high peak levels (mean, 31.8  +/- 3.1 micrograms/ml). these results indicate that the in vitro and in vivo efficacies of e1077 are similar to those of cefpirome except against p. aeruginosa and p. vulgaris.

TI  == antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of unripe papaya.
AB  == the meat, seed and pulp of carica papaya linn., a popular traditional medicinal herb grown in the tropics, was shown by the agar-cup method to be bacteriostatic  against several enteropathogens such as bacillus subtilis, enterobacter cloacae,  escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the same parts of papaya were  unequivocably demonstrated by electron spin resonance spectrometry to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (5.8 x 10(14) spins/ml), hydroxyl (5.1 x 10(14) spins/ml) and superoxide (1.2 x 10(14) spins/ml) radicals with the seed giving the highest activity at concentrations (ic50) of 2.1, 10.0 and 8.7 mg/ml, respectively. the superoxide dismutase (sod)-like activity in the meat, seed and  pulp amounts to about 32, 98 and 33 units/ml; comparable to those of soybean paste miso, rice bran and baker's yeast. vitamin c, malic acid, citric acid and glucose are some of the possible antioxidative components in papaya. our study correlates the bacteriostatic activity of papaya with its scavenging action on superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which could be part of the cellular metabolism of such enteropathogens. this is indicative of the pathophysiological role of these reactive oxygen species in gastrointestinal diseases and papaya's ability to counteract the oxidative stress.

TI  == survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the royal london hospital.
AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

TI  == comparative study of pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin.
AB  == we compared the pharmacokinetics and the serum bactericidal activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. fifteen healthy volunteers received 1 g of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone intravenously, 500 mg of imipenem-cilastatin intravenously, and 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally.  high-performance liquid chromatographic assays were used to quantitate unchanged  antibiotic in plasma and urine. serum bactericidal activities were determined against six clinical isolates each of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa by using a modified microdilution method of reller and stratton (l. b. reller and c. w. stratton, j. infect. dis. 136:196-204, 1977). overall, cefpirome exhibited pharmacokinetics similar to those of ceftazidime: half-life (t1/2), 1.95 h; concentration at 1 h (c1h), 47 to 49 micrograms/ml for both antibiotics. ceftriaxone displayed the longest t1/2 (7.65 h) and the highest c1h (137.8 micrograms/ml), while we observed the shortest t1/2 (1.05 h) and the lowest c1h (19.85 micrograms/ml) with imipenem. at 1 h, cefpirome and, even more so, imipenem showed significantly better serum bactericidal activities against s. aureus (1:273 and 1:80) than did the other antibiotics (p less than 0.0005; analysis of variance with randomized block design and bonferroni correction). against e. cloacae, we observed the highest serum bactericidal titers at 1 h with cefpirome, and this superiority vis-a-vis the other antibiotics tested was maintained for up to 8 h after dosing. ceftazidime remained the most active agent tested against p. aeruginosa (serum bactericidal activity titers, 1:43 at 1 h) up to 8 h. in summary, the study showed that cefpirome and imipenem provide more potent serum bactericidal activities than do broad-spectrum cephalosporins against s. aureus; thus, both of these antibiotics should be adequate against serious s. aureus infections. in addition, cefpirome appears to be a promising alternative for treatment of infections caused by e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == nonspecific reactions of a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (tecra) for detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins in foods.
AB  == a staphylococcal enterotoxin visual immunoassay kit (tecra) has recently become commercially available. since the kit is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system equipped with polyvalent antisera against staphylococcal enterotoxin types a to e (sea to see) and the test is simple and rapid to perform (4 h), it has been widely used for screening purposes. in this study, the sensitivity of the kit for detection of sea, seb, and sec in ham, cheese, and mushrooms was similar  to those of kits based on an enzyme immunoassay and reversed passive latex agglutination: 0.75 to 1.0 ng of sea per ml, 0.5 to 0.75 ng of seb per ml, and 1.0 to 1.25 ng of sec per ml. however, the tecra kit showed nonspecific reactions with food samples contaminated by microorganisms other than staphylococcus aureus, such as enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. the substance contributing to the false-positive results differed from true staphylococcal enterotoxins in that it was (i) heat labile (completely inactivated by heating for 2 min at 100 degrees c, whereas true staphylococcal enterotoxins were inactivated by about 10% with this treatment), (ii) lower in molecular weight than staphylococcal enterotoxins, and (iii) not bound to a copper chelate sepharose gel (all of the substance remained in the unbound wash fraction, whereas staphylococcal enterotoxins were quantitatively bound to the gel). the problem of false-positive results with the tecra kit could be resolved by heat treatment (2 min at 100 degrees c) or by cleanup procedures involving metal chelate affinity chromatography with copper chelate sepharose for 4 h before use  of the tecra kit.

AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

TI  == changing patterns of blood culture isolates from patients with acute leukemia: a  review of twenty years' experience.
AB  == during the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. the frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. this was opposite to the decreased frequencies of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the isolates of p. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, staphylococcus aureus  were ranked as major pathogens. among the recent isolates of s. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. therefore, until more effective means for control of p. aeruginosa bacteremia in  particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.

AB  == a total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml) by agar dilution method. these included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), 31 of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 49 of neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of haemophilus influenzae, 112  of escherichia coli, 118 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of proteus mirabilis, 30 of proteus vulgaris, 60 of serratia marcescens, 113 of enterobacter cloacae, 60 of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of bacteroides fragilis. the results revealed that  46.6% of p. mirabilis, 53.4% of h. influenzae, 57.1% of n. gonorrhoeae, 80% of p. vulgaris, 83.9% of mrsa, 85.6% of mssa, 87.5% of e. coli, 91.7% of s. marcescens, 95.7% of b. fragilis, 98.2% of e. cloacae, and 100% of k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers.  the ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of mssa, mrsa, h. influenzae, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, e. cloacae, b. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of mssa, h. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of mrsa, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris and b. fragilis strains. clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of sce-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  == sce-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and e1040. against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, sce-2787 was more active than ceftazidime  and e1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. sce-2787 was also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the mic90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. sce-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis, although its mic90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. the activities of sce-2787 against streptococcus species, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. furthermore, mic90s of sce-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates  of citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae. sce-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with km or ki values of greater than 100 microm. the in vitro activity of sce-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. thus, sce-2787 appears to be a promising  cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.

TI  == development of resistance during ceftazidime and cefepime therapy in a murine peritonitis model.
AB  == resistance emerging after ceftazidime or cefepime therapy was investigated in a peritonitis model. mice were given a peritoneal challenge (10(8) cfu plus talcum) and treated by either antibiotic (50 mg/kg/dose, which produced similar antibiotic concentrations in peritoneal fluid in both cases). after one or three  doses, resistance never developed in serratia marcescens or citrobacter freundii  infections. after enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa challenge, ceftazidime selected more resistance (21/36 cases) than did cefepime (1/36 cases). in mice challenged with resistant strains selected by ceftazidime therapy, cefepime (six doses) successfully treated 7/18 e. cloacae infections but 0/18 p. aeruginosa infections; ceftazidime was never effective. neither cefepime  nor ceftazidime cured mice infected with the resistant strain selected by cefepime. mics were poor predictors of further emergence of resistance in mice inoculated with strains classified as susceptible, but antibiotic-containing agar gradients plated with a high inoculum (10(8) cfu) allowed better prediction. in selected clinical situations, cefepime may be preferable because it may be associated with less frequent emergence of resistance.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

TI  == impact of voluntary vs enforced compliance of third-generation cephalosporin use  in a teaching hospital.
AB  == study objective: the purpose of this study was to assess and compare the impact of voluntary compliance and enforced compliance with institutional guidelines for initiating third-generation cephalosporin therapy. design: an audit of third-generation cephalosporin use during a 6-month period shortly after ceftriaxone and ceftazidime were added to the hospital formulary already containing cefotaxime was performed. during this period, compliance to institutional guidelines for initiating therapy was voluntary. a follow-up audit  during a similar 6-month period was performed to assess compliance with institutional guidelines shortly after an enforcement policy was placed in effect. the results of these two audits were compared to assess usage patterns of these cephalosporins, compliance rates with institutional guidelines for initiating therapy, use of susceptibility testing to guide therapy, effect of use of these drugs on susceptibility patterns within the hospital, and third-generation cephalosporin costs during periods when institutional policy was unenforced and enforced. results: only 24.2% of 66 courses of third-generation cephalosporins were initiated in compliance with institutional guidelines during  the initial audit period. susceptibility testing revealed an organism susceptible to a first-generation cephalosporin in 13 courses but in only six instances was a switch to the more narrow-spectrum antibiotic performed. at the time routine susceptibility testing to ceftazidime and ceftriaxone was instituted, 92% of enterobacter cloacae were sensitive to ceftriaxone and 89% of pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime. fifteen months later, when voluntary compliance to institutional policy was terminated, 70% of e cloacae were sensitive to ceftriaxone and 73% of p aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime. during the last 6 months of this period, pharmacy expenditures totaled $50,000. the second audit revealed 85.4% of 48 courses of treatment complied with guidelines for initiating therapy. since enforcement was instituted, sensitivity  of e cloacae to ceftriaxone has risen to 88% and sensitivity of p aeruginosa to ceftazidime has increased to 80%. pharmacy expenditures decreased to $23,000.

TI  == pharmacokinetic disposition and bactericidal activities of cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone in serum and blister fluid.
AB  == cefepime is a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent gram-positive and gram-negative activity including activity against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. the pharmacokinetic disposition of cefepime is similar to that of ceftazidime. we compared the pharmacokinetic characteristics and the extent and duration of bactericidal activity in serum and suction-induced blister fluid after single 2-g intravenous doses of cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone given to healthy subjects. one clinical isolate each of e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus was used to assess bactericidal  activity. results of the pharmacokinetic analysis were similar to previously reported data for these drugs. the high serum protein binding of cefoperazone (approximately 90%) contributed to poor blister fluid penetration. the other drugs penetrated well into this fluid compartment. cefepime showed significantly  greater bactericidal activity in serum and blister fluid against e. cloacae than  the other study drugs, ceftazidime was significantly better in serum and blister  fluid against p. aeruginosa, and cefoperazone was significantly better against s. aureus only in serum. none of the study drugs had significant bactericidal activity in blister fluid against s. aureus. cefepime is a promising antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infections due to e. cloacae.

TI  == comparison of susceptibility to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents among bacteria isolated from intensive care units.
AB  == evaluating microbial isolation and susceptibility patterns from institutional settings is a well-established component of ongoing infection control activities. at the university of michigan hospitals, susceptibility profiles for selected bacteria tested from 1984 to 1989 were analyzed for major changes in the percentage of organisms susceptible to beta-lactam antimicrobials. data on bacteria isolated from respiratory specimens obtained from 1433 patients in intensive care units (icus) during a 10-month interval were compared with like data obtained from 750 non-icu patients. antimicrobial agents studied were chosen based on hospital formulary availability and prevailing usage in the institution. susceptible and moderately susceptible categories were combined for purposes of reporting, since empiric therapeutic doses would cover strains having both susceptibility levels. antimicrobic susceptibilities were compared and differences analyzed among the icus. major shifts in susceptibility were noted during the 5-year period. the incidence and susceptibility profiles of the microorganisms varied considerably between icu and non-icu patients. pseudomonas  aeruginosa isolates from individual icus showed large variations in prevailing susceptibilities, with the burn unit harboring the most resistant strains. however, the neurological, surgical, and critical care medicine units also showed large numbers of antimicrobial-resistant pseudomonads. among enterobacter cloacae isolates, only imipenem showed a high level of activity against both icu and total hospital isolates. when examined by individual icu, however, imipenem resistance was seen in the general medicine and burn units. the burn and pediatric icus showed increased rates of recovery of beta-lactam-resistant e. cloacae isolates, although significantly high resistance rates were seen throughout all icus. the surgical icu was noted to have an abnormally high incidence of lower respiratory infections caused by p. aeruginosa. the antibiogram indicated that one possible epidemic strain was involved. however, when the isolates were subjected to fatty-acid profiling by gas-liquid chromatography, it was found that cross-contamination with five discernible strains had occurred among the ten patients tested. these preliminary data suggest that resistant pseudomonads can be harbored and spread within an icu, and that the icu can act as a reservoir of resistance that is spread to a "step-down" unit.

TI  == [a clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (cs-976, papm/bp), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical  efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. the duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. when clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. it was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. it was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. papm/bp was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses  daily to 10 cases. for the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. the efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. the overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. as pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. they were gram-positive cocci including 2  strains each of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus viridans  and a strain of streptococcus spp., and gram-negative rods including 9 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas spp.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == a diphasic immune response against bacteria in the american cockroach.
AB  == the adult cockroach generates an adaptive humoral immune response exhibiting specificity and immunological memory when immunized with soluble proteins. in contrast, the response induced by bacteria in holometabolous insects is non-specific and short term, generally losing activity after 72 hr. we have found that the roach generates a diphasic response when injected with bacteria, displaying an acute non-specific phase initially, which is then superseded by a second response that is relatively long term and specific. animals were immunized with either killed pseudomonas aeruginosa or pyrogen-free burns-tracey saline (bts) and challenged at various times post-immunization (p.i.) with a lethal dose of viable p. aeruginosa. the induction of immunity was measured by monitoring the percentage of survivors after challenge. immunization with killed p. aeruginosa induced significant (p less than 0.05) protection against challenge as compared with bts controls. the response was elicited by day 1 p.i. and did not begin to decline until after day 14 p.i. the specificity of the response was tested by immunizing animals with either killed serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae,  streptococcus lactis or micrococcus lysodeikticus, and then challenging them with live p. aeruginosa. significant protection against p. aeruginosa challenge was induced by any of the bacteria within the first 3 days p.i. however, by day 4 the response began to show specificity. immunization with p. aeruginosa induced significantly more protection than immunization with any one of the other organisms, and only the gram-negative organisms (p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae and s. marcescens) induced any protection relative to controls.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [synergistic action of cefodizime with other antimicrobial agents on clinically isolated microorganisms. ii. synergistic action with sisomicin].
AB  == cefodizime (cdzm) possesses a broad antimicrobial spectrum and a relatively long  half life in the blood. in addition, it shows excellent therapeutic efficacies in the treatment of infections in leukopenic animal models, hence it is expected that cdzm may have good efficacies against various infections in immunocompromised hosts. in the meantime, sisomicin (siso) not only has strong antibacterial activities against gram-negative rods (gnr), but has relatively low nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. thus, we examined antibacterial effectiveness of  the combination of cdzm and siso against clinical isolates in vitro. 1. antibacterial effects of cdzm+siso combination were examined using siso susceptible strains of escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. observations that the combination of the 2 drugs showed fic indices between less than 0.5-less than 1.0 against most of these strains at siso concentrations of 1 mic or sub mic levels strongly  suggested the presence of a synergistic action between the 2 drugs against siso susceptible strains of gnr. 2. of the strains tested, 10% of c. freundii, 6.7% of e. cloacae, 63.3% of s. marcescens, 23.3% of p. vulgaris and 18.0% of p. aeruginosa were found to be resistant to siso, and little synergistic effect of the 2 drugs was observed against these strains. 3. as the synergistic effect of the 2 drugs against gnr was observed against siso susceptible strains including those which were resistant to cdzm, but not against those strains which were resistant to siso, it seems reasonable to conclude that the appearance of the synergistic effect between the 2 drugs depends on the activity of siso.

TI  == beta-lactamase stability and inhibitory activity of meropenem combined with a potent antibacterial activity.
AB  == the affinity of meropenem for various known types of beta-lactamases and its stability to them were tested in comparison with other beta-lactams, including imipenem. meropenem exhibited a marked stability to all beta-lactamases tested and was only hydrolyzed by xanthomonas maltophilia beta-lactamase, as were other  beta-lactams. this was responsible for the potent antibacterial activities of meropenem against beta-lactamase-producing strains. meropenem and imipenem had almost the same, relatively high affinity for beta-lactamases; however, they had  a lower affinity than clavulanic acid for penicillin beta-lactamases and cefoxitin for cephalosporin beta-lactamases. meropenem also had higher beta-lactamase inhibitory activity than imipenem. meropenem inhibited type iii (tem-1), ia citrobacter freundii and ic proteus vulgaris beta-lactamases in a progressive manner. meropenem was thought to be a potent inhibitor of various beta-lactamase because of its ability to form stable enzyme-meropenem acyl-complexes. meropenem generally exhibited a lower induction potential than imipenem against five clinical isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter cloacae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa, but its induction potential was higher than that of ceftazidime. meropenem induced beta-lactamases at concentrations above the mic.

AB  == the nctc type strains and four clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa were exposed, in agar, to cefepime at 3, 5, and 10 x mic and a breakpoint concentration of 16 mg/l. mutants were selected at  a frequency of approximately 10(-8) that had decreased susceptibility to cefepime and cefpirome, and species-dependent resistance to other beta-lactams. any putative mutant with a greater than four-fold increase in the mic was examined to determine its beta-lactamase expression and outer membrane protein (omp) profile. mutant strains of p. stuartii and m. morganii lacked an omp of molecular mass similar to that of ompf, and were cross-resistant to nalidixic acid. mutant strains of e. cloacae had derepressed class i beta-lactamase production and lacked an omp corresponding to ompf, suggesting that in this species both parameters are necessary for decreased susceptibility. derepressed beta-lactamases purified from mutant strains of e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. stuartii was able to hydrolyse cefepime, but not as quickly as tem-10.

TI  == beta-lactamase inhibitors: relation between kinetic data and in-vitro synergism studies.
AB  == because of the need for control of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance and the recent development of tazobactam, the author has examined the inhibitors of various beta-lactamases for their effectiveness. on the basis of the kinetic data, tazobactam exhibited the highest affinity to various beta-lactamases. a combination with tazobactam was found to enhance the effectiveness of piperacillin against s. aureus producing penicillinase, e. coli producing tem-1 or tem 2 enzymes and class i beta-lactamase-derepressed isolates of e. cloacae, serratia spp. and c. freundii, however not p. aeruginosa, while there was no marked synergism in beta-lactamase-derepressed clones of k. oxytoca.

TI  == characterization of fce 22101-resistant enterobacteriaceae and the effect of fce  22101 upon the activity of anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams for pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == twenty-five strains of enterobacteriaceae (five each of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii) were exposed to fce 22101 in agar containing 3, 5, or 10 x the mic. any putative mutant with a greater than or equal to four-fold increase in the mic was examined for beta-lactamase expression and outer membrane protein (omp) profile.  mutant colonies were selected at a frequency of 10(-7)-10(-11) with decreased susceptibility to fce 22101 and other beta-lactams, but after one subculture on antibiotic-free agar the mutants from 13 of the 25 strains reverted to wild-type. only 19 stable mutants were selected from the other 12 wild-type strains, of which 15 lacked an omp of similar molecular size to ompf, and/or a low size omp of approximately 18 kda. none of the mutants had a significant alteration in expression of richmond & sykes class i beta-lactamase. in a separate section of the study in which 50 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined, it was found that fce 22101, at a concentration of 4 mg/l, induced beta-lactamase expression such that, after 24 h exposure, 24 of the 50 strains had a greater than or equal to four-fold rise in the mic of several anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams.

TI  == an evaluation of the antibacterial activities of combinations of sulfonamides, trimethoprim, dibromopropamidine, and silver nitrate compared with their uptakes  by selected bacteria.
AB  == modifications of antibacterial activity have been demonstrated using combinations of two antibacterials from trimethoprim, sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, and silver sulfadiazine), silver nitrate, and dibromopropamidine isethionate, either formulated in a cream base or dissolved in peptone water. the creams were evaluated using the agar cup diffusion method in isosensitest agar. the peptone water solutions provided fractional inhibitory concentrations for combinations of the antibacterial substances. the test organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and staphylococcus aureus. bacterial uptakes of antibacterial combinations, determined by either an hplc assay method or an atomic absorption method, combined with dry cell weight determinations, indicated that enhancement of activity of the antibacterial combinations against p. aeruginosa (two strains) and e. cloacae were related to marked increases in the bacterial uptake of the chemical agents. decreases in activity were related to decreased uptake of either dibromopropamidine and/or silver ions. the effect of the trimethoprim and the sulfonamides was shown to depend on their effect on bacterial folate synthesis. it is suggested that partial blockade of the folate synthetic pathway leads to an effect on cell permeability which results in increased uptake of antibacterials. dibromopropamidine isethionate also has an effect on cell permeability which produces an increased bacterial uptake of a second antibacterial present in the medium. these findings provide further explanation of how subinhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim and sulfonamide combinations are synergistic against a wide range of bacteria even when certain bacteria are resistant to either member of the combination.

AB  == cefpodoxime, the deesterified part of the orally available cefpodoxime proxetil,  is active against most enterobacteriaceae with mic50 of 0.06 to 2 mg/l. only enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains show mic50 of 4 mg/l. coagulase negative staphylococci have a mic50 of 2, while staphylococcus aureus strains have a mic of 4 mg/l. in comparison to other orally available cephalosporins cefpodoxime is slightly less active than cefixime and cefotiam against gram-negative bacteria but more active than cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin. against staphylococci the activity of cefpodoxime is comparable to that of cefotiam and cefuroxime and superior to cefaclor and cephalexin, while cefixime does not have sufficient activity against these species. like all cephalosporins cefpodoxime has no activity against enterococci.

AB  == twenty-five strains of enterobacteriaceae (five each of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii) and five strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were exposed to various concentrations of cefpirome or ceftazidime in agar. mutants with a greater than four-fold increase in the mic were examined for changes in beta-lactamase expression and outer membrane protein (omp) profile. both agents selected mutants with decreased susceptibility to the selecting antibiotic and other beta-lactams  at a frequency of 10(-7)-10(-8). the mics of all beta-lactams were higher for the resistant mutants of e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa than for the other species. both agents selected mutants expressing derepressed class i beta-lactamase, but this was more common with ceftazidime. only a few mutants of p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae had an mic of cefpirome that was above the recommended breakpoint concentration. some mutant strains of enterobacteriaceae lacked an omp of molecular size similar to ompf, but the mic of cefpirome was below the breakpoint concentration for all these strains.

TI  == the influence of clinical use of antibiotics and the sensitivity of strains isolated from postoperative infections--a comparison of nosocomial pathogens with strains isolated from the bacterial flora of patients.
AB  == in the present study, we investigated how the recent clinical use of antibiotics  have altered the antibiotic susceptibility of strains isolated from postoperative infections, especially gram-negative rods. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, serogroup  e strains accounted for about 20 per cent of postoperative infections, but were unable to be isolated from either the feces of patients on admission or from the  appendix contents of patients with appendicitis. it therefore appeared that serogroup e strains were responsible for the nosocomial infections in our department. the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa serogroup e, which we assumed to be nosocomial pathogens,  acquired a high level of resistance to antibiotics soon after third-generation cephems became widely used. on the other hand, the antibiotic susceptibility of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and the serogroups of pseudomonas aeruginosa other than e, which were considered to originate from the bacterial flora of patients, did not vary throughout the several years of the study period.

TI  == influence of beta-lactamase inhibitors on the potency of their companion drug with organisms possessing class i enzymes.
AB  == the ability of beta-lactamase inhibitors to induce class i beta-lactamases in certain organisms in vitro suggests a potential for antagonism in vivo. therefore, a study was designed to assess the ability of sulbactam and clavulanate to induce beta-lactamases in two strains each of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa both in vitro and in vivo. induction in vitro was observed only with s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa and generally only when inhibitor concentrations greater than 2 micrograms/ml were examined. a mouse model of lethal infection, designed to detect in vivo antagonism arising from beta-lactamase induction, was  used to determine what effect sulbactam and clavulanate would have on the 50% protective doses (pd50s) of cefoperazone and ticarcillin. antagonism (a significant increase in the pd50) was observed in only 4 of 32 tests. three of these involved antagonism of cefoperazone by clavulanate, and one involved antagonism of cefoperazone by sulbactam. in 6 of 32 tests, enhancement of efficacy (a significant decrease in pd50) was observed. in four of these, sulbactam enhanced cefoperazone; in one, sulbactam enhanced ticarcillin; and in one, clavulanate enhanced ticarcillin. four of the six cases of enhancement occurred when the beta-lactamase inhibitor was given at the time of challenge. none of these positive or negative in vivo effects were predicted by in vitro tests. these data suggest that beta-lactamase inhibitors can influence the in vivo potency of their companion drug in both a beneficial and detrimental fashion against organisms with class i beta-lactamases and that these effects cannot be predicted from in vitro assays.

TI  == imipenem- and meropenem-resistant mutants of enterobacter cloacae and proteus rettgeri lack porins.
AB  == carbapenems such as imipenem and meropenem are not rapidly hydrolyzed by commonly occurring beta-lactamases. nevertheless, it was possible, by mutagenesis and selection, to isolate mutant strains of enterobacter cloacae and proteus rettgeri that are highly resistant to meropenem and imipenem. two alterations were noted in the e. cloacae mutants. first, the mutant strains appeared to be strongly derepressed in the production of beta-lactamases, which reached a very high level when the strains were grown in the presence of imipenem. second, these mutants were deficient in the production of nonspecific porins, as judged by the pattern  of outer membrane proteins as well as by reconstitution assays of permeability. as with most porin-deficient mutants, their cultures were unstable, and their cultivation in the absence of carbapenems rapidly led to an overgrowth of porin-producing revertants. analysis of the data suggests that the synergism between the lowered outer membrane permeability and the slow but significant hydrolysis of carbapenems by the overproduced enzymes can explain the resistance  phenotypes quantitatively, although the possibility of alteration of the target cannot be excluded at present. with p. rettgeri mutants, there was no indication  of further derepression of beta-lactamase, but the enzyme hydrolyzed imipenem much more efficiently than the e. cloacae enzyme did. in addition, the major porin was absent in one mutant strain. these results suggest that a major factor  for the carbapenem resistance of these enteric bacteria is the porin deficiency,  and this conclusion forms a contrast to the situation in pseudomonas aeruginosa,  in which the most prevalent class of imipenem-resistant mutants appears to lack the specific channel protein d2 yet retains the major nonspecific porin f.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antimicrobial activities of a novel cephalosporin derivative, cp6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the c-3 side chain.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a novel cephalosporin derivative, cp6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the c-3 side chain, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, with ceftazidime, aztreonam and cefoperazone as the reference  antibiotics. cp6162 showed weak or little activity against gram-positive bacteria, but potent activity against clinical isolates of the gram-negative species including strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, ps. cepacia, acinetobacter sp., xanthomonas maltophilia, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to the reference antibiotics. the mics of cp6162 were only slightly affected by the high producers of beta-lactamases except for cephalosporinase-producing c. freundii. it was, however, affected by the presence of ferric ion. cp6162 showed in-vivo activity paralleling the in-vitro activity, and also showed pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of ceftazidime in mice and rats.

TI  == comparison of silver sulfadiazine 1% with chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% to silver sulfadiazine 1% alone in the prophylactic topical antibacterial treatment  of burns.
AB  == wound bacterial colonization in 118 patients treated with chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% in silver sulfadiazine 1% applied daily to the burn wounds was compared to that of 135 comparable patients similarly treated with silver sulfadiazine 1%. with chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% in silver sulfadiazine 1%, colonization by staphylococcus aureus was less frequent (38%) than with silver sulfadiazine (54%, p = 0.016). no statistical difference was found for colonization by enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or enterobacter cloacae. washing of the wounds of 65 patients with chlorhexidine gluconate 4% during daily dressing changes was associated with reduced wound colonization by s. aureus (35% versus 51%, p = 0.03) and p. aeruginosa (8% versus 16%, p = 0.08)  when compared to the 188 washed with nonantibacterial soap. chlorhexidine, whether added to the topical agent silver sulfadiazine (chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2%) or in the bath soap (chlorhexidine gluconate 4%), decreased colonization by s. aureus.

TI  == fleroxacin combined with rifampin.
AB  == we determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. none of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. the mean fic was 1.2. when using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin mics of 285 isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, bacteroides, and clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. time-kill studies against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the mbc. the fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but  provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin administered intravenously in a pharmacodynamic in vitro model.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was evaluated in an in vitro model by simulating its pharmacokinetics following a single 100 or 200 mg administration intravenously. the one compartment open model described by grasso and coworkers was used for these experiments. ciprofloxacin concentrations in the model were reproduced by calculations based on the concentration-time curve in human volunteers as reported by wise and others. the maximum reduction of viable cell count for enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus was from two-to three-orders of magnitude; for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae from four to seven orders. a rapid killing was recorded both for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but the initial killing was more prolonged and more pronounced for the  higher dosage. the last did not interfere with regrowth that occurred for all strains after eight hours.

TI  == in vitro study of the transfer of cytokine-inducing substances across selected high-flux hemodialysis membranes.
AB  == the in vitro transfer of cytokine-inducing substances (cis) across cellulose triacetate and polyacrylonitrile hollow-fiber high-flux hemodialyzers was studied using culture filtrates of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hemodialysis center environments. with enterobacter cloacae, no transfer of cis was seen despite the potent cytokine inducibility and endotoxin content of the challenge solution. in contrast, interleukins 1 and 6 and tumor necrosis factor inducing substances did penetrate both dialyzer types challenged with pseudomonas aeruginosa culture filtrates containing a high endotoxin content. transfer was not seen, however, upon dilution of the challenge solution to lower, yet clinically very high levels of endotoxin. these results show that, in vitro, the  transfer of cis across high-flux membranes is critically dependent upon the quality and the quantity of the challenge material employed.

TI  == in vitro effect of chlorhexidine and amikacin on oral gram-negative bacilli from  bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == prophylactic use of chlorhexidine (chx) mouthrinses has been shown to benefit the oral health status of bone marrow transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed persons and to reduce systemic complications of oral origin. however, a problem that often emerges with these patients is oropharyngeal and lower respiratory tract colonization by opportunistic aerobic or facultative gram-negative bacilli (gnb). trends in four studies indicated that chx rinses may predispose these persons to oral colonization by gnb such as the enterobacteria,  klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. since gnb are generally susceptible to broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotics such as amikacin, the in vitro sensitivities of k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli atcc reference strains and k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae oral clinical isolates to combinations of chx and amikacin were determined by means of a disk diffusion sensitivity assay on mueller-hinton agar. the amikacin minimum inhibitory concentrations for all gnb tested were much lower (less than or equal  to 4.69 to less than or equal to 9.37 micrograms/ml) than those for chx (less than or equal to 18.75 to less than or equal to 300 micrograms/ml), and combinations of chx and amikacin gave larger growth inhibition zones than chx alone. no antibacterial antagonism between chx and amikacin was found, and their  solubilities were compatible. therefore use of topical amikacin in conjunction with chx rinses may reduce oral colonization by gnb in severely immunocompromised patient populations.

TI  == a randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  == febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a hickman line-associated infection. at 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol  violation or death due to other causes. a total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (34), hodgkin's disease  (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), escherichia coli (13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), klebsiella sp. (3), enterobacter cloacae (2), streptococcus faecalis (2), ent. adenocarboxylata (1), clostridium septicum (1). strept. b (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and p. fluorescens (1), in-vitro testing showed that all  gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. there were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), strep. sangius (1), strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and p. maltophilia (1). both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. there is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. in view of the very high incidence of gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that  teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in  all febrile neutropenic patients.

TI  == [fournier's gangrene: report of 3 cases].
AB  == fournier's gangrene is defined classically as a fulminant, rapidly spreading infection of the scrotum that also involves the perineum, penis and abdominal wall. the pathologic findings are described as synergistic gangrene secondary to  a polymicrobial flora with a poorly defined portal of entry. we report 3 cases of fournier's gangrene. case 1 was a 67 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and necrosis. case 2 was a 59 years old who was admitted with the problem of scrotal swelling and pain, he had sought other medical help without success, and was then transferred to our hospital. case 3 was a 62 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling  and pain for 2 days. these 3 patients were all found to have diabetes mellitus. all 3 patients required aggressive surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics and adjunctive measures. blood cultures were usually negative and pus cultures were typically aerobic gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria of various types, especially bacteroids fragilis. our pus cultures revealed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in case 1, enterobacter cloacae in case 2 and e. coli, b. fragilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in case 3. this disease is no longer a disease of young men. after 1945, the average age in 119 reported cases was 51.3 years and the average age of our cases was 62.7 years. before the era of antibiotics, scrotal gangrene was not a rarity. in these modern times, in spite of seeking medical attention early, patients still developed scrotal gangrene and the mortality rate is high.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == we determined the mics of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of escherichia coli, 66 strains of  klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of serratia marcescens, 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in tohoku district of  japan during the period from january to april in 1989. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against s. aureus, b. catarrhalis, p. aeruginosa and a. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. ampicillin and cefteram were more active against s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes than other antibiotics. new-quinolones and  cephems of new-generation were active against h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and s. marcescens. of 30 strains of s. aureus which were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (mic greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. twenty strains (6.5%) of s. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of h.  influenzae were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. of 101 strains of h. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. the above results indicated that mrsa is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.

TI  == effect of ceftazidime and gentamicin on the oropharyngeal and faecal flora of patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  == thirty-four patients with haematological malignancies were studied to investigate the effect of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (ceftazidime and gentamicin) on the gastro-intestinal flora. twenty-five patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or post-autologous bone-marrow transplantation were given framycetin, nystatin and colistin (fracon), and two patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma were on co-trimoxazole, as long-term gut prophylaxis. semi-quantitative  microbiology was carried out on oropharyngeal swabs and quantitative microbiology on faecal specimens. the oropharyngeal flora consisted mainly of streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci and coryneforms, and was little affected by ceftazidime/gentamicin. a strain of enterobacter cloacae resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin colonized one patient, who later developed septicaemia. the faecal flora of patients on fracon was dominated by enterococci; the few enterobacteria  present were eliminated by ceftazidime/gentamicin. the anaerobic flora was absent in 15% of patients; in the remainder, it consisted mainly of bacteroides spp., and was little affected by ceftazidime/gentamicin. the faecal flora of patients not on fracon always contained anaerobes, and some strains of enterobacteria persisted throughout antibiotic treatment. none of the patients was colonized by  clostridium difficile or pseudomonas aeruginosa. broad-spectrum therapy with ceftazidime and gentamicin appeared to have little effect on the gastro-intestinal flora, except to encourage the overgrowth of enterococci and reduce the numbers of enterobacteria.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of dq-2556 and its stability to various beta-lactamases.
AB  == dq-2556, a new cephalosporin, showed a broad antibacterial spectrum over gram-positive and -negative organisms. the activity of dq-2556 against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and enterobacteriaceae was comparable with that of cefpirome, and superior to that of ceftazidime. dq-2556 was almost as active as cefpirome against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was less active than ceftazidime. with the exception of ps. aeruginosa, dq-2556 was bactericidal against various organisms at either the mic or twice the mic. dq-2556 bound preferentially to penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) 2, 1 and 3 of staphylococcus aureus, pbps 3, 1a and 1b of escherichia coli and pbps 1a, 3 and 4 of ps. aeruginosa. dq-2556 was stable to various penicillinases and cephalosporinases, but was unstable to oxyiminocephalosporinases. the km values of dq-2556 for the cephalosporinases of citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were only two- or three-fold higher than those of ceftazidime, indicating that dq-2556 had a relatively high affinity for these enzymes compared with other recently developed cephalosporins. the mic of dq-2556 for esch. coli increased four-fold in an ompf-deficient mutant, indicating that the ompf porin was one of the major routes for penetration of dq-2556 into esch. coli cells.

TI  == a prospective study of long-term use of amikacin in a paediatrics department. indications, administration, side-effects, bacterial isolates and resistance.
AB  == amikacin (amikin; b-m) was used as the only aminoglycoside for 18 months in a paediatric department within a general hospital because of high levels of resistance of klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae isolates to tobramycin, gentamicin and netilmicin. between 1 february 1987 and 31 july 1988, 816 children were treated with a slow intravenous injection at a standardised dose adjusted for weight and age. respiratory disease was present in 35.8% of 537 neonates, 56.4% of 190 infants and 70.9% of 89 older  children. escherichia coli (65 isolates), klebsiella species (59 isolates), enterobacter species (26 isolates) and p. aeruginosa (22 isolates) constituted the most common gram-negative pathogens. the positive blood culture yield was 7.8%. satisfactory median peak and trough serum amikacin levels were achieved. no significant renal side-effects were noted. severe bilateral hearing loss in 1 low-birthweight infant resulted from inadvertent overdosage. at the end of this 18-month surveillance period 97.7% of e. coli, 98.6% of k. pneumoniae, 96.3% of e. cloacae, and 98.0% of p. aeruginosa isolates remained sensitive to amikacin, while resistance of k. pneumoniae to tobramycin, netilmicin and gentamicin decreased significantly (p less than 0.003, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.007 respectively; chi-square test).

AB  == this study examined the occurrence of non-oral gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods in advanced adult periodontitis. speciation and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the microscan micromethod system. a total of 42 taxa of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae and acinetobacter were isolated from 427 of 3,050 (14.0%) patients. in 159 (5.2%) patients, these organisms comprised more than 5% of the cultivable subgingival microflora. enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter agglomerans accounted for more than 50% of all strains isolated. virtually all study strains demonstrated high in vitro susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, but exhibited variable susceptibility patterns to 18 other antimicrobial agents tested. in 3 "refractory" periodontitis patients heavily infected with enteric rods, systemic ciprofloxacin therapy (500 mg bid for 10 days) led to resolution of the subgingival infections and improved clinical periodontal status. the present findings indicate that 5% of severe periodontitis lesions may harbor high levels of non-oral, gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods. systemic ciprofloxacin appears to be capable of eradicating these potential pathogens from deep periodontal pockets.

AB  == we evaluated relationships between production of beta-lactamase and their resistances to beta-lactams, effect of sulbactam (sbt), a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against beta-lactam resistant strains, and combined effect of sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) with other antibiotics against multi-resistant strains. through these studies, we obtained the following results. 1. most of the strains resistant to beta-lactams were beta-lactamase producers. 2. relationships between the production of beta-lactamase and their resistances to beta-lactams indicate that their resistances generally were the highest in producers of both penicillinase (pcase) and cephalosporinase (cepase), moderate in producers of either pcase or cepase, and the lowest in beta-lactamase non-producers. most of highly-resistant strains of mrsa appeared to be beta-lactamase non-producers though some exceptions were observed among methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 3. sbt showed good effect against pcase producers, moderate effect against producers of both pcase and cepase, little effect against cepase producers, and no effect against beta-lactamase non-producers. 4. results of combined effect of sbt/cpz with other antibiotics indicated that good synergism was obtained by combining sbt/cpz with  fosfomycin (fom) or piperacillin against multi-resistant strains of proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, and s. marcescens, by combining sbt/cpz with ceftazidime (caz) or fom in methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and by combining sbt/cpz with caz in p. aeruginosa. 5. better synergism was obtained with the higher concentrations of antibiotics.

TI  == determination of optimal dosage regimen for amikacin in healthy volunteers by study of pharmacokinetics and bactericidal activity.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and serum killing curves of amikacin, which was administered by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of single doses of 7.5 mg/kg and then 15 mg/kg, were investigated in six healthy volunteers who received the two doses in  a crossover study with a washout period of 20 days. the serum killing curves were determined for four bacterial species: escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all strains were serum resistant, and the bactericidal activity was analyzed by separating the early phase (first 5 h) and the late phase (24 h) of the killing curve. for the early phase, the bactericidal activity was evaluated by correlating an index of surviving bacteria with amikacin concentrations. this methodology allowed determination of two parameters: the maximal effective concentration and the lowest effective concentration. for the late phase, the threshold values separating bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities were lower than 10 mg/liter for each strain. the concentration dependence of amikacin bactericidal activity was confirmed for escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and, to a lesser extent, for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. correlation of these  data with amikacin pharmacokinetic data in volunteers indicated that a daily dose of 15 mg/kg may be effective in the treatment of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae infections. for pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens, the partially time-dependent activity probably necessitates two daily administrations and combination with another antibiotic.

AB  == clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (azt) were performed in neonates. the results are summarized as follows: a total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. azt 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. concomitantly, vancomycin (vcm) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (abpc) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for  2-6 days. of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of azt were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. all of the causative organisms (escherichia coli in 3 and enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with azt. neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by azt was observed. mics of azt against 10 clinical isolates (staphylococcus aureus 1, e. coli 4, klebsiella pneumoniae 1, e. cloacae 1, haemophilus influenzae 1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients  with bacterial infections were examined. as results, azt showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against p. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  == chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. the controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. the effect on the following bacteria was studied: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, wolinella recta, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. the plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees c for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. it inhibited the majority of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, except for some serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) of 8 micrograms/ml  against pseudomonas aeruginosa. most group a, b, c, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or  equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates. the mic90s of ro 23-9424 for enterococcus faecalis and listeria  monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. ninety percent of clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas bacteroides fragilis had an mic90 of 32 micrograms/ml. there was a minimal inoculum size effect. the mics and mbcs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. the mics of ro 23-9424 for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.

TI  == interactions of tazobactam and clavulanate with inducibly- and constitutively-expressed class i beta-lactamases.
AB  == clavulanate and tazobactam (ytr 830) were tested as inhibitors and inducers of the ampc-type class i beta-lactamases of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and the ic beta-lactamase of proteus vulgaris. both clavulanate and tazobactam inhibited  the pr. vulgaris class ic beta-lactamase and potentiated ticarcillin and piperacillin against beta-lactamase derepressed variants of this species. tazobactam, but not clavulanate, also had some ability to inhibit the ampc class  i enzymes of m. morganii, c. freundii, ps. aeruginosa, e. cloacae and s. marcescens. the piperacillin + tazobactam combination, unlike ticarcillin + clavulanate, showed some degree of synergy against most derepressed strains of these species. this behaviour partly depended upon the greater inhibitory activity of tazobactam for the enzymes, but also on piperacillin being easier to  potentiate than ticarcillin. the synergy between piperacillin and tazobactam was  greatest for m. morganii and c. freundii, least for ps. aeruginosa and e. cloacae. unfortunately, it is in the last two species that these enzymes pose the greatest resistance threat. tazobactam caused little or no antagonism of piperacillin against beta-lactamase inducible species, whereas clavulanate antagonized ticarcillin against beta-lactamase inducible strains of e. cloacae and m. morganii (not other species). the antagonism of ticarcillin was attributable to beta-lactamase induction. the lack of antagonism with the tazobactam+piperacillin combination was related to tazobactam being a weaker inducer than clavulanate, not to piperacillin being less susceptible to antagonism than ticarcillin.

TI  == in vitro investigation of bk-218, a new oral and parenteral cephalosporin.

TI  == outer membrane permeability and beta-lactamase stability of dipolar ionic cephalosporins containing methoxyimino substituents.
AB  == some enteric bacteria, such as enterobacter cloacae, can develop high-level resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins by overproducing their chromosomally  encoded type i beta-lactamases. this is because these agents are hydrolyzed rapidly at pharmacologically relevant, low (0.1 to 1 microm), concentrations, owing to their high affinity for type i enzymes. in contrast, the more recently developed cephalosporins, with quaternary-nitrogen-containing substituents at the 3 position, show increased efficacy against beta-lactamase-overproducing strains  and, indeed, have a much lower affinity for type i enzymes. however, the possible contribution of an improved outer membrane permeability in their increased efficacy has not been studied. we found by proteoliposome swelling assays that cefepime, cefpirome, and e-1040 all penetrated the porin channels of escherichia  coli and e. cloacae much more rapidly than did ceftazidime and at least as rapidly as did cefotaxime. considering that the influx of anionic compounds such  as cefotaxime and ceftazidime will be further retarded in intact cells, owing to  the donnan potential, we expect that the newer compounds will penetrate intact cells 2 to 10 times more rapidly than will cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the kinetic parameters of hydrolysis of these agents by e. cloacae beta-lactamase showed that at 0.1 microm, they were hydrolyzed much more slowly than was cefotaxime and at about the same rate as or a lower rate than was ceftazidime. the combination of these two effects explains nearly quantitatively why these newer agents are more effective against some of the beta-lactamase-overproducing  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == three-year experience with sonicated vascular catheter cultures in a clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  == using a quantitative sonication method, we cultured 1,681 consecutive vascular catheters submitted to a clinical microbiology laboratory in a 36-month period. a total of 46% of the cultures were positive; the most common organisms isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci (36.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), enterococci (10.0%), yeasts (9.2%), staphylococcus aureus (5.8%), and enterobacter species (4.4%). the frequencies of positive blood cultures within 48 h prior to a positive catheter culture result were as follows: candida albicans (68.4%), s. aureus (60%), enterobacter cloacae (42.9%), staphylococcus epidermidis (32.1%), p. aeruginosa (27.7%), and enterococci (23.3%). the sonication method allowed quantification of the number of cfu removed from a catheter for between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. for catheter cultures in which greater  than or equal to 10(2) cfu grew, a linear regression equation could be calculated: (risk of positive blood culture for the same organism) = 14 [log10 (number of organisms removed from the catheter)] -21 (r = 0.93). for catheter cultures in which less than 10(2) cfu grew, positive blood cultures for the same  organism were strongly associated with a proven infection at a site distant from  the catheter (p = 0.001) or probable contamination (s. epidermidis). our findings indicate that this technique has considerable potential for use in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in the diagnosis of vascular catheter infections and for clinical investigations into the pathogenesis of these infections.

AB  == cefpirome (hr 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. it was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. hr 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (caz), cefoperazone (cpz), and cefotaxime (ctx) on systemic infections induced by escherichia coli ec-31, staphylococcus aureus smith, and serratia marcescens sm-6 in mice. against systemic infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa hr 810 was as effective as caz. mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant s. aureus  (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and enterococcus faecalis. hr 810 was superior to cefuzonam (czon) and cefmetazole against mrsa and mssa and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against e. cloacae and a. calcoaceticus. in the activity against e. faecalis, hr 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to czon. in mice with pyelonephritis caused by e. coli ec-7, the rank order of activities was hr 810 greater than caz greater than ctx greater than cpz. hr 810  was more effective than latamoxef, caz, ctx, and cpz in improving lung infections induced by streptococcus pneumoniae hl 438 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp-51 in mice. hr 810 was superior to ctx and cpz and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with e. coli ec-89 and s. aureus smith in rats.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacodynamics of beta-lactam antibiotics on gram-negative bacteria by studying the in vitro postantibiotic effect (pae), initial killing and morphology. the pae of aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem, mecillinam and piperacillin on enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was studied by use of bioluminescence assay of bacterial atp. the strains were exposed for 2 h to the beta-lactam antibiotics which were then eliminated by 10(-4) dilution. with e. coli, spheroplasts were seen during incubation with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem and mecillinam and a long (greater than 1 h) pae was noted. in contrast, aztreonam and piperacillin produced a short (less than or equal to 1 h) pae. this was seen concomitantly with the production of filaments and weak initial killing.

AB  == in a single-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, 100 successive patients were enrolled with serious skin and soft-tissue infections, whose illnesses had precipitated an initial hospital admission or an extension of inpatient care. there were 93 evaluable patients who received either ofloxacin, 400 mg orally every 12 hours plus an intravenously administered placebo every eight hours, or cefotaxime, 2.0 g intravenously every eight hours plus an orally administered placebo every 12 hours. the average length of therapy was 12 days. both patient groups had similar demographics and underlying conditions. wound infection was the most common diagnosis, followed by abscess, cellulitis, and trophic ulcer. multiple pathogens were commonly isolated from infected sites (1.4 pathogens/patient). the most common pathogen was staphylococcus aureus, followed  by escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, proteus/providencia spp., and enterobacter spp. persistence of the initial pathogen at the end of therapy was observed in 22.5 percent of the cefotaxime-treated group, but in only 10 percent of the ofloxacin-treated group.  there was one clinical failure in the cefotaxime group, caused by a susceptible strain of enterobacter cloacae, and there was one clinical failure in the ofloxacin group, in which the patient had an acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus wound infection and subsequently developed a p. aeruginosa superinfection. adverse experiences, including rash, insomnia, and nausea, occurred in 16 percent of the patients in each group. it was concluded that oral  ofloxacin is as safe and efficacious as parenteral cefotaxime in the treatment of serious skin and skin structure infections.

TI  == intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin therapy versus intravenous ceftazidime therapy for selected bacterial infections.
AB  == the efficacy and toxicity of sequential intravenous and oral ciprofloxacin therapy was compared with intravenously administered ceftazidime in a prospective, randomized, controlled, non-blinded trial. thirty-two patients (16 patients receiving ciprofloxacin and 16 patients receiving ceftazidime) with 38 infections caused by susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa, enteric gram-negative rods, salmonella group b, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas cepacia, and xanthomonas maltophilia at various sites were evaluable for determination of efficacy. length of therapy varied from seven to 25 days. concomitant antimicrobials included intravenously administered beta-lactams for gram-positive organisms, intravenous/oral metronidazole and clindamycin for anaerobes, and intravenous/local amphotericin b for candida albicans. intravenous administration of 200 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 hours to 11 patients produced peak serum levels  between 1.15 and 3.12 micrograms/ml; trough levels ranged between 0.08 and 0.86 micrograms/ml. overall response rates were similar for patients receiving ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. emergence of resistance was similar in both groups--one enterobacter cloacae and two p. aeruginosa became resistant after ciprofloxacin therapy and two p. aeruginosa became resistant after ceftazidime therapy. the frequency of superinfection with a variety of organisms was also similar in both groups. adverse events related to ciprofloxacin included transient pruritus at the infusion site and generalized rash leading to drug discontinuation (one patient each), and with ceftazidime adverse effects included pain at the site of infusion and the development of allergic interstitial nephritis (one patient each). overall, intravenous/oral ciprofloxin therapy appears to be as safe and effective as intravenous ceftazidime therapy in the treatment of a variety of infections due to susceptible aerobic gram-negative organisms.

TI  == clavulanate and beta-lactamase induction.
AB  == concern has been expressed that clavulanate can antagonize ticarcillin against enterobacteria and pseudomonads that have inducible expression of chromosomal 'class i' beta-lactamases. it is suggested that clavulanate-induced enzyme inactivates ticarcillin, which itself is a feeble inducer. we confirmed that this mechanism applied, showing that antagonism was abolished in beta-lactamase-basal  mutants of inducible strains. antagonism has been reported in double disc tests with strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and indole-positive proteeae. only with some strains of ent. cloacae and morganella morganii, however, did the presence of 1-32 mg/l clavulanate elevate the mic of ticarcillin by more than one or two dilutions in chequerboard studies. clavulanate was synergistic with ticarcillin against proteus vulgaris strains, being a potent inhibitor of the unusual class i enzyme  of this species. induction-determined antagonism was not reduced in ent. cloacae  transconjugants that produced the plasmid-mediated tem-1 beta-lactamase, despite  the ability of this enzyme to bind clavulanate. our results suggest that ent. cloacae and m. morganii strains should be confirmed not to be more sensitive to ticarcillin alone than to ticarcillin/clavulanate, before the latter combination  is used clinically. otherwise, it appears that beta-lactamase induction is unlikely to cause significant antagonism. it is emphasized that induction is reversible, causing, at worst, a transient resistance. it should not be confused  with the selection of stably-derepressed mutants that can occur, for example, in  the clinical use of newer cephalosporins.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

TI  == interactions of meropenem with class i chromosomal beta-lactamases.
AB  == most newer penicillins and cephalosporins are labile to the class i beta-lactamases that are inducible in pseudomonas aeruginosa. enterobacter spp.,  citrobacter spp., serratia spp. and indole-positive proteeae, but fail to induce  enzyme synthesis below the mic. they remain active against the inducible strains  but not against mutants (termed 'stably depressed') that manufacture beta-lactamase copiously without induction. such mutants are segregated at high frequency and may be selected during therapy, sometimes causing clinical failure. meropenem induced class i enzymes weakly below the mic in ps. aeruginosa, ent. cloacae, c. freundii, ser. marcescens, morganella morganii and pr. vulgaris. nonetheless it remained equally active against inducible strains and their derepressed mutants, and was no more active against laboratory-derived beta-lactamase basal mutants. it did not select derepressed mutants from beta-lactamase-inducible populations. these data suggested great stability to class i beta-lactamases, and this deduction was confirmed by direct assays with purified beta-lactamases. initial hydrolysis rates ranged from 0.9-10.0 drug molecules hydrolysed/enzyme molecule/minute but these values declined by 80-90% before 5% of the antibiotic had been hydrolysed, indicating that the carbapenem could deactivate the enzymes. deactivation was reversible, full activity being restored once the meropenem was removed. these results suggest that meropenem, like imipenem and various experimental penems, may overcome the resistance problems presented by class i beta-lactamases.

TI  == the emergence of beta-lactam resistance among strains of enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the development of multiresistant bacterial strains associated with the use of the new beta-lactam antibiotic agents has prompted investigation into the mechanisms involved. factors influencing beta-lactamase production, alterations of target-protein structure or production and decreases in bacterial outer membrane permeability have been identified as the three general mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in aerobic gram-negative bacteria. because there is no dna interaction by beta-lactam agents, emergence of resistance results from either spontaneous mutation or the presence of resistant subpopulations; the presence of antibiotics allows for overgrowth of resistant strains. studies have indicated that there is a significant relationship between the rate of emerging resistance  and the ratio of the minimum inhibitory concentration of a beta-lactam to the drug concentration used to select for resistance in vitro or achieved at the infection site in vivo. it is concluded that the use of synergistic combinations  of agents should reduce the emergence of beta-lactam-resistant bacterial strains. thus the choice of an appropriate therapeutic agent requires thorough evaluation  of the specific pathogen for susceptibility to a variety of beta-lactam agents and aminoglycosides.

AB  == it has been recognized by clinical data that most of sepsis occurring in the immunocompromised host are endogenous infection. in recent years, we have investigated the mechanism of these bacteremia and sepsis by experimental studies using neutropenic mice treated with cyclophosphamide. and we evidenced that most  pathogens causing bacteremia originated in the intestinal flora of the host. it has been shown that bacteria causing bacteremia were divided into two main groups, causing systemic bacteremia and causing portal bacteremia. pseudomonas aeruginosa and morganella morganii belonged to the former, on the other hand, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and some other bacteria belonged to the latter. in this study, we studied the role of the reticuloendothelial system (res) in the etiology of bacteremia or sepsis, using various kinds of bacteria isolated from bacteremic mice. as a result, the following facts were revealed. 1. it was suggested that the low blood clearance rate of the bacteria was one of the great risk factor of systemic bacteremia, since the blood clearance rate of bacteria causing systemic bacteremia was significantly lower than those of bacteria causing portal bacteremia. 2. bacteria in the blood were eliminated by the res, mainly by the liver, and the level of bacterial clearance by the liver was relative to the type of bacteremia which was systemic or portal. 3. it was suggested that the bacterial clearance by the liver mainly reflected the phagocytosis by kupffer cells, and especially the adherence of these cells to bacteria as the first step of phagocytosis.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the new aminoglycoside dactimicin in comparison to amikacin was tested alone and in combination with piperacillin, mezlocillin and ceftazidime against freshly isolated clinical pathogens. dactimicin was more active than amikacin against enterobacter cloacae, providencia rettgeri and salmonella spp., and less active than amikacin against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus. using the checkerboard technique, the combination of either dactimicin or amikacin with the other drugs  was shown to result in synergistic interaction against most of the 23 strains tested. dactimicin-ceftazidime and amikacin-ceftazidime were the most effective combinations, demonstrating synergism against 91% and 95% of the isolates respectively. antagonism was not encountered. using the time-kill method, synergism was seen in most cases, indifference rarely being seen; antagonism was  not observed. dactimicin induced a post-antibiotic effect which ranged from 1 h for enterobacter cloacae to 2.4 h for escherichia coli. an average post-antibiotic effect of 0.6 h was also seen when dactimicin was combined with piperacillin, mezlocillin and ceftazidime. the findings indicate that dactimicin  compares favorably in vitro with amikacin and suggest that clinical trials with this drug alone or in combination are warranted.

TI  == product of the lactococcus lactis gene required for malolactic fermentation is homologous to a family of positive regulators.
AB  == malolactic fermentation is a secondary fermentation that many lactic acid bacteria can carry out when l-malate is present in the medium. the activation of  the malolactic system in lactococcus lactis is mediated by a locus we call mler.  induction of the genes necessary to perform malolactic fermentation occurs only in bacteria with a functional copy of mler. the mler gene consists of one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 33,813 daltons. the amino acid sequence of the predicted mler gene product is homologous to that of positive activators in gram-negative bacteria: lysr, ilvy gene products of escherichia coli, metr, cysb of salmonella typhimurium, ampr of  enterobacter cloacae, nodd of rhizobium sp., and trpi of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == emergence of resistance in gram-negative bacilli during beta-lactam therapy: a challenge for the future.
AB  == the means by which gram-negative bacilli can resist newer beta-lactam antibiotics are reviewed. a first situation is generated by mutants which produce great amounts of a chromosomal cephalosporinase. these cells are present (frequency: 10(-4) to 10(-7] within bacterial populations such as enterobacter cloacae, and multiply after selection during therapy by third-generation cephalosporins or monobactams. a second problem arose by 1985, with the sudden development of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases markedly active against third-generation cephalosporins. some recent molecules, such as penems, are not affected by the two mechanisms mentioned above but remain exposed to other resistance problems. notably pseudomonas aeruginosa strains can develop resistance during therapy by imipenem thanks to specific alterations of the bacterial outer membrane. as a consequence of these resistance difficulties, new interpretations for susceptibility testing and new therapeutic approaches should be considered.

TI  == value of surveillance cultures in the management of neutropenic patients.
AB  == to assess whether bacteriological surveillance cultures can be used to predict infection in neutropenic patients, cultures were performed during the period of neutropenia of nose, throat and urine specimens collected once weekly and faeces  specimens collected twice weekly. seventy-six consecutively observed patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematological or non-haematological diseases were investigated. severe infection including septicaemia, lower respiratory tract infection, anorectal lesion and urinary tract infection occurred in 32 patients.  enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the organisms most commonly involved. in the majority of cases of septicaemia the organisms were isolated from the faeces, often in pure culture, prior to the onset of septicaemia. most of the isolates of enterobacter cloacae were resistant to the empiric antibiotic therapy used in the unit and were able to colonise multiple sites, presumably increasing the risk of subsequent infection. faecal culture is the most useful approach in bacteriological surveillance in neutropenic patients.

AB  == antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (crmn) and aztreonam (azt] against gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (pc: piperacillin (pipc],  cephems (ceps: ceftazidime (caz), cefotaxime (ctx), latamoxef (lmox), cefsulodin  (cfs], carbapenem (imipenem (ipm] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (nflx) and ofloxacin (oflx] as reference antibiotics. a total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae, were used as test  strains. 1. crmn and azt, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of e. coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp., m. morganii, p. rettgeri or h. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of s. marcescens. on the other hand, isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter spp. and p.  aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. among these cases, whereas r strains, i.e. resistant strains showing mics greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion  of strains resistant to pc and ceps, i strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing mics between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. strains resistant to pipc, a pc, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. antibacterial activities of ceps varied against different bacterial species. while strains resistant to ctx, caz and lmox were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter spp. and s. marcescens, large percentages of lmox-resistant strains of c. freundii and enterobacter spp. were of the i type. ctx-resistant strains were also found among isolates of p. vulgaris and m.  morganii. proportions of cep-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa were 28% for cfs  and 12% for caz. 4. no or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to ipm, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and ceps against klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis and h. influenzae.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  == over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the third department of medicine, kanazawa university hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. this incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. the  rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the  first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. the majority of p. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of o-antigen  groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species, and staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide  with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins  and central venous catheters. it is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of p. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.

AB  == susceptibilities of gram-negative bacterial strains isolated at the university hospital in 1987 to six beta-lactam antibiotics (azthreonam cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, latamoxef, aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin) and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin and amikacin) were examined by agar dilution and the agar diffusion method. results obtained from both methods correlated well in most of the strains. most of the strains belonging to escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were sensitive to the beta-lactam antibiotics except aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin. they were also sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. most strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were sensitive to azthreonam, latamoxef and aminoglycosides, but were less sensitive to other beta-lactams. acinetobacter calcoaceticus was generally resistant to beta-lactams except ceftizoxime, but was sensitive to aminoglycosides. more than half of the strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to azthreonam, piperacillin and aminoglycoside antibiotics and only latamoxef was active in pseudomonas maltophilia.

TI  == ultrasonic disintegration of bacteria may lead to irreversible inactivation of beta-lactamase.
AB  == when ultrasonic disintegration of bacteria was employed to liberate intracellular beta-lactamases there was rapid and irreversible inactivation of the type-id beta-lactamase from pseudomonas aeruginosa. various type-v beta-lactamases (pse-2, 3 and 4) from p. aeruginosa, as well as enterobacter cloacae type-ia beta-lactamase were much less affected by sonication. none of the beta-lactamases was inactivated by french press disruption. we suggest that french press disruption should be the method of choice for the release of beta-lactamases, unless the enzyme in question is known to be unaffected by ultrasonic treatment.

TI  == [microorganisms isolated from urinary tract infection and their beta-lactamase production and evaluation of clinical efficacy of sulperazone].
AB  == clinical survey of microorganisms isolated from urinary tract infection (uti) was carried out at the four major hospitals in mie prefecture from may to july, 1987, and production of beta-lactamase of the microorganisms was determined by the acidimetric method, "beta-checker". among the total of 460 strains isolated from  urine samples, 135 of gram positive cocci and 325 of gram negative rods were contained. sixty percent of the gram negative rods and 14% of gram positive cocci produced beta-lactamase. pseudomonas aeruginosa, e. coli and serratia marcescens  were representative organisms which produced beta-lactamase. acinetobacter, klebsiella, enterobacter and citrobacter species produced beta-lactamase at a higher rate but those were not so frequently isolated. in the sensitivity test to sulperazone, the representative organisms isolated from urine, as a whole, had a  sensitivity of 74% and e. coli, klebsiella, s. epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were highly sensitive, while enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens showed low sensitivity. the clinical efficacy of sulperazone was evaluated in 26 patients with complicated uti. overall effectiveness rate and eradication rate of beta-lactamase production organisms were 73.1 and 63%, respectively. sulperazone is concluded to be a useful antibiotic for treating complicated uti induced by beta-lactamase production organisms from the point of  microbiology and safety.

TI  == simple assay of beta-lactamase with agar medium containing a chromogenic cephalosporin, pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac).
AB  == a new beta-lactamase assay method with agar plates containing pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac) (50 microm), a beta-lactamase-labile, chromogenic cephalosporin, was examined. on the padac plates inoculated with beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (10(4) cfu per spot) and incubated at 37 degrees c, a yellow zone showing hydrolysis of padac by beta-lactamase was formed around the colony. the zone diameter increased with incubation time. examination with enterobacter cloacae gn7471 revealed that  beta-lactamase activity was present in the agar around the colony, decreasing exponentially with increasing distance from the colonial margin; this suggests that the padac hydrolysis zone is formed by an extracellular enzyme. at 18 h, significant correlations were obtained between the zone diameters of the 10 species (clinical isolates) examined and their periplasmic beta-lactamase activities determined spectrophotometrically. the addition of clavulanic acid (0.5 to 10 micrograms/ml) inhibited zone formation on the padac plates inoculated with type iiia, va, vb, pse-1, and ic beta-lactamase producers. when the clinical isolates were tested on plates with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml), inhibition was observed in 41 to 58% of the escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in all isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus vulgaris. thus, the use of the inhibitor made it  possible to detect penicillinase or type ic cephalosporinase producers. these results proved that the padac plate might be a useful tool permitting easy, semiquantitative determination of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == mechanism of inhibition of chromosomal beta-lactamases by third-generation cephalosporins.
AB  == the kinetic interactions of the beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae 908 r with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime have been examined in detail. with  all of these cephalosporins, there is an initial rapid reaction involving opening of the beta-lactam that then decreases to a slower steady-state rate (kss) of beta-lactam hydrolysis (at 37 degrees c: ceftriaxone, kss = 0.044 s-1; cefotaxime, kss = 0.033 s-1; ceftazidime, kss = 0.011 s-1). more than stoichiometric quantities of beta-lactam are cleaved during the rapid phase, during which there is accumulation of a transiently stable cephalosporin-enzyme complex whose rate of breakdown is slower than the overall rate of hydrolysis. qualitatively similar behavior is observed with the e. cloacae m6300 beta-lactamase. these observations eliminate the possibility that the reaction follows a simple linear kinetic scheme. a branched kinetic scheme in which an initially formed acyl intermediate partitions between deacylation and elimination of the 3' substituent is proposed to explain the data. investigations of the interaction of ceftriaxone with the chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases from citrobacter freundii, providencia rettgeri, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli show that the partitioning behavior of e. cloacae beta-lactamases is atypical. all of the data, however, clearly demonstrate that it is a physical impossibility for cephalosporin trapping to contribute to bacterial resistance phenotypes.

TI  == the differential expression of genes for the pse-4 beta-lactamase in pseudomonas  aeruginosa and the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the pse-4 beta-lactamase has been identified, for the first time, in two non-pseudomonal strains. the gene in klebsiella pneumoniae 241 (dal1) was located on a plasmid (puk700) and was freely transferable to other enterobacterial strains and pseudomonas aeruginosa. on the other hand, the gene in enterobacter cloacae a113 (dal2) could only be transferred in the presence of a mobilizing plasmid. when both these genes were transferred within the enterobacteriaceae, the beta-lactamase produced was slightly different from the prototype 'dalgleish' pse-4 enzyme. however, when dal1 and dal2 were transferred to p. aeruginosa the enzyme expressed was identical to this prototype enzyme. in addition, both these  genes expressed higher levels of pse-4 beta-lactamase production in p. aeruginosa than found in the enterobacteriaceae. thus it appears that the biochemical properties of the pse-4 gene products from dal1 and dal2 are host-modified.

AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == antibacterial activities of cefotaxime and its major metabolite, desacetylcefotaxime, against 178 strains (of 10 species) were assessed in terms of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic50 and mic80), and were compared with those of cefoperazone and ceftazidime. the activity of desacetylcefotaxime was several times less than that of cefotaxime against almost all of the species tested. against staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae  and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic80 values of desacetylcefotaxime were higher than those of cefoperazone and ceftazidime. the antibacterial potency of desacetylcefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas cepacia was superior to that of cefoperazone and ceftazidime, and comparable with the activities of the latter compounds against the other 4 gram-negative species. partial synergy was demonstrated in the activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against most of the strains examined. antagonism was observed in activity against 2 of 18 strains of m. morganii. in general, desacetylcefotaxime enhances the potency of its parent compound, cefotaxime, when they coexist. intravenous infusion of cefotaxime 1 g over a period of 1 hour resulted in mean peak serum concentrations of 48.5 mg/l of cefotaxime and 6.5 mg/l of desacetylcefotaxime at the end of the infusion. the mean elimination half-life in beta-phase of cefotaxime was 0.8 hour and that of desacetylcefotaxime was 2 hours.

TI  == a regional survey of the resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of (facultative) aerobic micro-organisms.
AB  == from 1980 to 1986 a regional survey was performed to investigate the susceptibility of beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in 6 hospitals located in the southern part of the netherlands. each year 300 to 400 strains were tested. the susceptibility to representatives of the older and the newer beta-lactam antibiotics was determined by a microbroth dilution assay using an inoculum size of 10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml in iso-sensitest broth (oxoid). no significant differences in antibiotic sensitivity of the micro-organisms from the different hospitals were found. there was no evidence for an increase in antibiotic resistance of the strains during the sampling period. in contrast, there was a general tendency to  an increase in antibiotic sensitivity.

TI  == [pseudomonas aeruginosa and surgical intensive care units].
AB  == the prevalence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care unit (icu) is 19 per cent although its incidence in blood culture is only 3.5 per cent and remains the same even though the total prevalence of this bacterium increases. a review of the clinical results shows that this germ causes severe complications in only 3 per cent of patients. a study by epidemiological markers reveals the presence of  16 different iats serotypes in the icu, this distribution of the serotypes being  similar to this observed in ambulatory patients. the serotype 12 of ps. aeruginosa is multiresistant. in 1984, it represented 22 per cent of the isolated ps. aeruginosa, its incidence decreases in 1985 and in 1986 (14.5%). ps. aeruginosa seems weakly pathogenic for the surgical patients in the icu. on the other hand, the incidence of klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens (014 imm. serotype resistant to tobramycin), enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae increases in blood cultures proportionally to their total prevalence in icu. these bacteria are probably responsible for hospital epidemics.

AB  == the addition of 1% chlorhexidine digluconate to 1% silver sulfadiazine cream (cdss) was compared with 1% silver sulfadiazine (ss) alone to assess the antibacterial effect of a once-daily application of the therapies on an experimental rat model with a 20% full-thickness burn wound seeded with 10(8) microorganisms originally isolated from infected wounds of burn patients. separate series evaluated staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and streptococcus faecalis. the mean concentration of all four organisms recovered after one week from biopsy specimens of full-thickness eschar was less in the cdss-treated animals compared with the ss-treated animals. microbial invasion into subjacent muscle was less frequent in animals seeded with s faecalis, while the mean concentration of bacteria recovered from muscle of animals seeded with s aureus and e cloacae was less in animals treated with cdss  compared with those treated with ss (p less than 0.05). the addition of 1% chlorhexidine digluconate to 1% silver sulfadiazine increased the antibacterial effectiveness of the latter agent.

TI  == induction of chromosomal beta-lactamases by different concentrations of clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin.
AB  == the effect of different concentrations of clavulanic acid (ca) in combination with ticarcillin on beta-lactamase production and ticarcillin mic was studied in  four clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, serratia  marcescens, citrobacter freundii and indole positive proteus strains. ticarcillin alone showed a low inducing effect for all species tested, ser. marcescens excepted. the increase in beta-lactamase activity after addition of ca (2-10 mg/l) was strain and species dependent. no synergy or antagonism was observed on  the ticarcillin mic for the micro-organisms producing only a chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase, though the susceptibility to ticarcillin strongly increased if the strains also produced a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase. addition of 50 or 100 mg/l ca resulted in all strains. c. freundii excepted, in a strong increase in beta-lactamase activity and in a strong synergistic effect on  the ticarcillin mic. however, these concentrations are unlikely to be achieved at clinical doses. thus, irrespective of the inducing effect of ticarcillin and ca (2-10 mg/l) combinations, induction of the chromosomal beta-lactamase did not result in a decrease in ticarcillin susceptibility.

TI  == sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  == the microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. phase i validated the ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose  injection and testing for recovery. phase ii validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (tpn) solutions. phase iii compared inpatient and home tpn microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase ii. test organism inocula used in  phase i and ii were candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. all contaminated  solutions in phase i showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. all phase ii-contaminated tpn solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. one hundred postinfusion tpn samples were collected randomly during phase iii from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. none of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient tpn samples developed visible turbidity. subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. this described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates  of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.

TI  == inducing capacity and selection of resistant variants of cefpirome (hr 810) in comparison with other beta-lactam compounds.
AB  == the inducing capacity of cefpirome (hr 810) and the ability of the compound to select for stable derepressed mutants was determined and compared with those of cefodizime (hr 221), cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefamandol. variations in both characteristics between and within species was observed. overall, cefodizime showed the lowest, cefamandol the highest inducing capacity. antibiotic resistant variants were isolated from all strains tested at a frequency of around 10(-9). a stable increased enzyme production was found in pseudomonas aeruginosa after exposure to ceftazidime as well as in the resistant mutants from enterobacter cloacae after selection with cefpirome, ceftazidime, cefotaxime and cefamandol. in the other resistant mutants the resistance was probably due to changes in permeability. all resistant variants remained relatively susceptible to cefpirome.

TI  == epidemiology of infections caused by gentamicin-resistant enterobacteriaceae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa over 15 years at the nashville veterans administration medical center.
AB  == nosocomial infections and gentamicin resistance were surveyed over 15 years at nashville veterans administration medical center, and trends for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were contrasted. analysis of approximately 6,000 nosocomial infections indicated that four-fifths were caused  by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. three hospital-wide outbreaks caused by enterobacteriaceae occurred; these three outbreaks were due to serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae, respectively. the outbreaks were temporally related to the emergence of gentamicin resistance. detailed analysis of the recent outbreak due to enterobacter indicated that an increasing prevalence of gentamicin-resistant e. cloacae predated nosocomial infections by several months; this pattern suggested that such outbreaks could be predicted. molecular epidemiologic data pertaining to the preservation over a decade of genes encoding gentamicin resistance were reviewed. in contrast to enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa gradually and progressively developed resistance to gentamicin that spread in an endemic fashion, with parallel increases in nosocomial infections. this pattern appeared to relate to different  modes of spread and persistence for resistant p. aeruginosa that may require unique methods for control.

TI  == cryoenzymology of beta-lactamases.
AB  == the cryoenzymology of several different beta-lactamases has been investigated. particular attention has been paid to the experimental pitfalls of the technique. these include such factors as false bursts at the start of the reaction, instability of the enzymes during turnover, and km values so high that little of  the enzyme is present as a complex. many of the difficulties in cryoenzymology stem from the use of organic cryosolvents. a novel "salt" cryosolvent has been tested: ammonium acetate solutions can be used down to about -60 degrees c. the enzymes examined are readily soluble, and stable, in this solvent. nevertheless,  out of 17 beta-lactamase beta-lactam systems, only 4 proved suitable for detailed investigation. in two of these, the hydrolysis of nitrocefin or 7-(thienyl-2-acetamido)-3-[[2-[[4- (dimethylamino)phenyl]azo]pyridinio]-methyl]cephem-4-carboxylic acid (padac), by  beta-lactamase i from bacillus cereus, substrate was converted into product at a  slow enough rate (at -60 or -55 degrees c, respectively) for it to be possible to do successive scans during the course of the reaction. the spectra were those of  substrate and product, and no intermediate was detected. the results argue against the accumulation of intermediate acyl-enzyme. the hydrolysis of padac by  the p99 beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae again showed spectra characteristic of substrate and product, and there was, moreover, a break in the  arrhenius plot; it is possible that a conformational change is (at least partially) rate-determining. the hydrolysis of dinitrophenylpenicillin by the p99 beta-lactamase did show features suggesting the accumulation of acyl-enzyme.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro activity of a new penem antimicrobial agent, cgp 31608, was compared with those of imipenem, sch 34343, and several other antimicrobial agents against approximately 600 bacterial isolates. cgp 31608 was active against gram-positive  organisms, including methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic for 90% of the isolates [mic90], 0.25 microgram/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococci (mic90s, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). penicillin-resistant streptococci (including enterococci) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were more resistant to the penem. activities of cgp 31608 against members of the family enterobacteriaceae were remarkably uniform, with mic90s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was at least as active as imipenem and ceftazidime and more active than piperacillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. drug activity was not influenced by the presence of any of 10 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. against strains of serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and p. aeruginosa with derepressible chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, the presence of cefoxitin did not induce increased resistance to cgp 31608. the new drug was also active against anaerobes (mic90s, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90s, 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/ml), and legionella spp. (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml). cgp 31608 showed an antibacterial spectrum similar to those of imipenem and sch 34343 (except that the latter is not active against p. aeruginosa) but was generally less potent than these drugs. however, cgp 31608 demonstrated more activity (mic90) than imipenem against p. aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus.

AB  == induction ratios were determined for beta-lactamase-inducible strains of enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa by using 10 beta-lactam agents. for e. cloacae, pre-incubation with ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, or imipenem produced significantly larger amounts of beta-lactamase than did pre-incubation with moxalactam, clavulanate, ceftazidime, or aztreonam.  for p. aeruginosa, imipenem was the best inducer, whereas ceftriaxone, piperacillin, cefoperazone, cefamandole, clavulanate, and aztreonam were poor beta-lactamase inducers. the rate of emergence of resistance by e. cloacae p99 and p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 did not correlate with the induction ratio of the selecting agent; however, a strong correlation was noted between the mutation rate and the ratio of the mic to the concentration of selecting antibiotic used.  emergence of resistance is related to the mic of the antibiotic and the concentration of antibiotic used to select for resistance and is independent of the efficacy of the beta-lactam inducer. resistant mutants arise through both beta-lactamase-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, b0-1165.
AB  == b0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. it inhibited the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and salmonella and shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the mics for individual isolates. enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime had mics that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. b0-1165 had activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. pseudomonas maltophilia and other pseudomonas species were resistant or had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, as did acinetobacter species. b0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as clostridium and bacteroides species. b0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally richmond-sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. it inhibited the enterobacter cloacae p99 and inducible pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. b0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing e. cloacae and c. freundii to b0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. overall, b0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of  other monobactams currently available or under investigation.

AB  == carumonam (ro 17-2301/ama-1080) is a new monobactam antibiotic. a comparative in  vitro evaluation with ceftriaxone was undertaken against 153 gram-negative clinical aerobic or facultative bacteria, both producers and nonproducers of beta-lactamase. results indicated that carumonam had an enhancement of activity for pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae and parallelled that of ceftriaxone against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and serratia marcescens. it can be concluded that carumonam could be an alternative of interest for the treatment of patients with infections due to gram-negative strains presumably or proven to be  multiresistant.

TI  == worldwide study of cefoperazone susceptibility.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility to cefoperazone of more than one million clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was evaluated in 369 hospitals in japan, the united states, canada, france, austria, and hungary. standard versions of the disk diffusion method were used according to interpretive criteria approved in the respective countries, and comparisons were made among the countries and among various body sites. susceptibility of organisms varied little within most species among the countries. minor differences in methodology and in interpretive criteria may explain some of the variations observed among countries and hospitals. the susceptibility of key pathogens to cefoperazone among countries ranged from 91% to 98% for escherichia coli, 73% to 91% for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% to 95% for klebsiella pneumoniae, 73% to 92% for enterobacter cloacae, 74% to 92% for staphylococcus aureus, and 91% to 97% for proteus mirabilis. susceptibility of isolates from the urinary tract did not vary markedly from that in other body sites.

TI  == [enzymologic aspect of piperacillin combinations].
AB  == like all penicillins, piperacillin exhibits some susceptibility to beta-lactamases of the penicillinase type, including those produced by staphylococcus aureus and the tem, oxa and carb enzymes isolated from gram-negative bacilli. piperacillin is very slightly hydrolyzed by cephalosporinases, which makes it similar to 3rd generation cephalosporins. when  tested with enterobacter cloacae gn 5797 and pseudomonas aeruginosa ntc 8303, two strains which produce inducible cephalosporinases, piperacillin had moderate inductive activity compared to cefoxitin, a potent inducer. induction was very low with enterobacter, but the drug was slightly more sensitive to pseudomonas. inhibition of this type of beta-lactamase synthesis was very strong when piperacillin was combined with amikacin and weaker when it was combined with pefloxacin. the piperacillin-amikacin combination prevented the development of piperacillin-resistant mutants of enterobacter and pseudomonas and, probably, of  all gram-negative bacilli. in our tests, the piperacillin-pefloxacin combination  was of interest only against enterobacter, and probably against all enterobacteria, since pseudomonas mutants that resist pefloxacin are fairly easily obtained in vitro.

TI  == the effects on beta-lactam susceptibility of phenotypic induction and genotypic derepression of beta-lactamase synthesis.
AB  == we have compared the ability of beta-lactam antibiotics to induce beta-lactamase  synthesis and antagonize the in-vitro activity of other beta-lactams and also to  select mutants with derepressed beta-lactamase synthesis amongst representative gram-negative bacilli that produce inducible beta-lactamases. both imipenem and cefoxitin were potent inducers of beta-lactamase and were able to antagonize the  activity of other beta-lactams against isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and pseudomonas aeruginosa when the two beta-lactams were present simultaneously. however, there was no antagonism for any compound against any of the organisms when the imipenem or cefoxitin was removed immediately before susceptibility to the other compounds was measured. cefotaxime was a less  potent inducer of beta-lactamase and failed to antagonize the activity of other compounds, even when present concurrently with them. neither imipenem nor cefoxitin induced beta-lactamase synthesis in a strain of escherichia coli, nor did they antagonize the activity of other beta-lactams against this strain. imipenem was compared with cefotaxime and cefoxitin as an agent for the selection of beta-lactam-resistant variants. resistant variants were obtained from isolates of ent. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa when cefotaxime or cefoxitin was used as the selective agent. most of them synthesized beta-lactamase constitutively and showed reduced susceptibility to a wide range of beta-lactams, but not to imipenem. variants with reduced susceptibility to imipenem were obtained only from the two isolates of p. aeruginosa. they did not show cross resistance to other beta-lactams and were not distinguishable from the parent strains in beta-lactamase production.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  == 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. the bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, e. agglomerans, e. cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozanae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, p. rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, citrobacter diversus, c. freundii, morganella morganii, serratia liquefaciens, s. marcescens, hafnia alvei, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. cepacia, p. maltophila, p. fluorescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, lancefield group a, b and d streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and bacillus species. in vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. of the 819 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. ninety-seven percent strains of p. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. all the 161 isolates of s. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. all gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of s. epidermidis and 5% isolates of s. agalactiae.

TI  == 7 alpha-formylamino substituent confers beta-lactamase-inactivating potency on 1-oxacephalosporins.
AB  == 7 alpha-formylamino-1-oxacephalosporins 7 alpha-formylamino-7 beta-[2- (methylaminocarbonyl)amino-2-(2-thienyl)acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h -tetra zol-5-yl)thiomethyl]-1-oxa-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (f1) and 7 alpha-formylamino-7 beta-(2-[(4-ethyl-2,3-dioxopiperazine-1- yl)carbonylamino]-2-phenylacetamido)-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetr azol-5-yl) thiomethyl]-1-oxa-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (f2) were stable against penicillinases and, moreover, inactivated cephalosporinases of pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter cloacae. extensive studies of  the inactivation of cephalosporinase of p. aeruginosa showed that it resulted from the formation of a transiently stable enzyme-compound complex. the 7 alpha-formylamino substituent was involved in the enzyme inactivation, because 7  alpha-methoxy congeners did not inactivate the enzyme. the number of compound molecules required for inhibition of an enzyme molecule was found to be 36 for f1 and 5.5 for f2, which suggests that the pathway to the complex formation branched off the hydrolysis pathway. half-lives of the complexes were 400 min for f1 and 260 min for f2. 7 alpha-formylamino compounds f1 and f2 had antibacterial activities similar to those of 7 alpha-methoxy congeners against beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria, whereas they were less active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. the conclusion was that the 7 alpha-formylamino substituent conferred the ability to inactivate cephalosporinase on the 1-oxacephalosporins tested, without much impairment of their antibacterial activity.

AB  == ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and  streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. they did not inhibit s. faecalis, s. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jk species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates,  were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, citrobacter diversus, and aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. a marked inoculum effect was noted for enterobacteriaceae carrying the richmond-sykes type 1a chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. cloacae, p99.

TI  == endotracheal aminoglycosides in gram negative pneumonia. a preliminary report.
AB  == five postoperative patients with respiratory failure and gram negative pneumonia  unresponsive to systemic antimicrobials were treated with endotracheally instilled aminoglycosides. sputum cultures in four patients grew pseudomonas aeruginosa and, in the fifth, enterobacter cloacae. the five patients had been treated systemically for an average of 13 days (range 9 to 19 days) without improvement prior to endotracheal antibiotic administration. the gram negative organisms disappeared from the sputum cultures in all patients within an average  of 4 days (range 2 to 8 days) following initiation of endotracheal antibiotics. all five patients had continued clinical improvement manifest by improved chest radiographs, improved oxygenation, and absence of the offending organisms from sputum cultures. none of the patients died from their gram negative pneumonia. this success coupled with data from other investigators suggests that endotracheal antibiotics should be considered in life-threatening gram negative pneumonias that are unresponsive to conventional systemic antimicrobials.

TI  == antibiotics in the second half of the 1980s. areas of future development and the  effect of new agents on aminoglycoside use.
AB  == articles in this supplement have examined in detail the role of aminoglycosides in the therapy of infections, addressing problems of resistance, toxicity, and efficacy. this article discusses other agents and their potential utility and effect on aminoglycosides. penem antibiotics, which have activity against only aerobic gram-negative bacteria, have recently been synthesized. these agents have proved effective in animal experiments; to date, however, results of human clinical trials are not available. carboxypenicillins and ureidopenicillins will  still have to be administered with aminoglycosides in patients with serious life-threatening infections or in those institutions in which organisms such as klebsiella, enterobacter, and pseudomonas exhibit high levels of resistance. what will be the role of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins? in some institutions, these agents might be used as sole therapy, particularly if they become less costly as  a result of competition. in other settings, concern over the resistance of organisms, such as enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, will result in the use of aminoglycosides with these relatively beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins. it will be necessary  to monitor the development of resistance to the new antibiotics and to determine  whether the use of aminoglycosides plus third-generation cephalosporin combinations results in decreased resistance. other agents to be considered include the directed therapy monobactams aztreonam and carumonam, the broad-spectrum carbapenem imipenem, and the penems under development. it is unclear whether these compounds might be used with aminoglycosides in critically  ill, infected patients. it is also unclear what role oral beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins will have in the therapy of nosocomial infections, since they probably will not be effective against many of the urinary or cutaneous infections that are treated with aminoglycosides. quinolone agents can be used successfully against many infections. however, the likelihood of bacterial resistance developing and their potential for toxicity are still unknown. thus, despite the emergence of many new agents, it appears that the time-tested aminoglycosides will continue to play an important role in antimicrobial therapy  for some time to come.

TI  == combination therapy: a way to limit emergence of resistance?
AB  == the ability of antibiotic combinations to limit the emergence of resistance during therapy was evaluated in a murine model. peritonitis was produced by injecting a mixture containing 10(8) colony-forming units of bacteria and sterilized talcum into the peritoneum. two hours later, a single antibiotic dose  was administered subcutaneously. the next day, peritoneal bacterial populations were analyzed on szybalski's gradients. acquired resistance was recorded when there was at least a fourfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations compared with untreated animals. no resistance emerged after amikacin monotherapy (15 mg/kg); however, resistance was frequently observed after monotherapy with ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) or pefloxacin (25 mg/kg). resistance to ceftriaxone and pefloxacin emerged, respectively, in 15 percent and 83 percent of animals with klebsiella pneumoniae, 71 percent and 54 percent with enterobacter cloacae, 0 percent and 83 percent with serratia marcescens, 25 percent and 100 percent with  pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 0 percent with both escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. in mice with k. pneumoniae or e. cloacae infections, any dual combination of amikacin, pefloxacin, and ceftriaxone produced less acquired  resistance than did monotherapy. in these animals, the combination of ceftriaxone and pefloxacin abolished all resistance, whereas the combinations of amikacin plus ceftriaxone or amikacin plus pefloxacin reduced the frequency of resistance  by more than half. in animals with p. aeruginosa or s. marcescens infections, resistance to pefloxacin diminished or disappeared after treatment with the combinations of pefloxacin plus ceftriaxone or pefloxacin plus amikacin. however, combinations with ceftriaxone resulted in more frequent resistance to ceftriaxone than did ceftriaxone alone. this was the case in p. aeruginosa infections treated with ceftriaxone plus amikacin (p less than 0.01), and in s. marcescens infections treated with ceftriaxone plus pefloxacin (p less than 0.05). despite these certain notable exceptions, our data confirm that in most cases combination therapy does limit the emergence of resistance.

TI  == sequence of the citrobacter freundii os60 chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase gene.
AB  == the citrobacter freundii os60 ampc beta-lactamase gene was sequenced and found to encode a 380-amino-acid-long precursor with a 19-residue signal peptide. the mature protein has a predicted molecular mass of 39781 da. the first 60 residues  of the purified enzyme, as determined by sequential edman degradation, are identical to the amino acid sequence inferred from the gene sequence. also, the amino acid composition determined for the purified beta-lactamase and that given  by the gene sequence are in good agreement. 77% of the amino acid positions hold  identical residues in the c. freundii and escherichia coli k12 chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases. this clearly puts the c. freundii enzyme into the class c of beta-lactamases. of the 68 amino-terminal residues determined for the enterobacter cloacae p99 beta-lactamase, 44 are identical to the corresponding residues of the c. freundii enzyme. all three enzymes, as well as that of pseudomonas aeruginosa 18s/h are highly similar around the active-site serine at  position 64 of the mature protein.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of foramidocillin.
AB  == foramidocillin is a 6-alpha-formamido penicillin with a 6-beta-acylureido side chain. the majority of the enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram of foramidocillin per ml, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. foramidocillin had activity comparable to those of  ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam against beta-lactamase-producing members of  the enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, and it inhibited organisms resistant to piperacillin. foramidocillin did not inhibit gram-positive species or anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. foramidocillin was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, oxa-2, pse-4, and shv-1, by the chromosomal beta-lactamases p99 of enterobacter cloacae and k1 of klebsiella oxytoca, or by the sabath-abraham enzyme of p. aeruginosa.

TI  == the colonization of patients in an intensive treatment unit with gram-negative flora: the significance of the oral route.
AB  == an extensive survey of patients and the environment in a newly refurbished intensive care unit showed that the principle species on patients in sites other  than the rectum were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter anitratus and enterobacter cloacae. multiple episodes of cross-infection were occurring with 10 different strains of these organisms. three oral solutions (mouthwashes, 'clinifeeds' and residual water from nasogastric aspiration apparatus) were heavily contaminated with coliforms including some epidemic strains and this corresponded with the finding that colonization with the above species usually occurred first in the mouth or respiratory tract. attempts to eliminate contamination of the solutions reduced colonization and cross-infection by over 50%, but did not eradicate it. two sinks without heat-traps on the drains possibly provided a long term reservoir of epidemic strains.

TI  == the activity of bmy 28142 a new broad spectrum beta-lactamase stable cephalosporin.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of bmy 28142, an iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin containing a methyl pyrrolidinio c-3 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem and tobramycin against various bacteria. bmy 28142 was the most active agent tested against the enterobacteriaceae inhibiting  90% at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. the in-vitro activity of bmy 28142 was equal to or superior to cefotaxime against the highly susceptible members of the enterobacteriaceae and several-fold superior to ceftazidime and aztreonam. bmy 28142 inhibited many enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. bmy 28142 was more active than imipenem against proteus, providencia and morganella species. ceftazidime and imipenem were more active than bmy 28142 against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it inhibited piperacillin and tobramycin-resistant isolates. bmy  28142 inhibited beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. bmy 28142 was more active than ceftazidime against streptococcal and staphylococcal species, but it did not inhibit or kill most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. bmy 28142 did not inhibit most bacteroides species. bmy 28142 was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it bound poorly to enterobacter beta-lactamase, was a poor inhibitor of the tem plasmid beta-lactamase and was a poor inducer of beta-lactamases.

AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp.

TI  == use of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.

TI  == in-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

TI  == emergence of resistance after therapy with antibiotics used alone or combined in  a murine model.
AB  == a murine model of peritonitis allowing detection and quantification of in-vivo acquired resistance during short term therapy has been used in order to evaluate  the capacity of antimicrobial combinations to limit emergence of resistance, as compared to individual components of the regimens. mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 10(8) cfu of bacteria. two hours later, a single antibiotic dose was injected subcutaneously: amikacin (15 mg/kg), ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg), pefloxacin (25 mg/kg), amikacin + ceftriaxone, amikacin + pefloxacin or ceftriaxone + pefloxacin. escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus never became resistant. single drug therapy yielded resistant mutants in enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa as follows: 74% of ceftriaxone-treated animals, 57% of pefloxacin treated animals and 27% of  amikacin treated animals. all the tested combinations reduced the frequency of in-vivo acquired resistance produced by single drugs, and no combination selected resistance when the separate agents of the combination did not. combining antimicrobial agents limits the risk of emergence of resistance during antibiotic therapy.

TI  == opportunistic infections in hysterectomy-derived, barrier-maintained guinea pigs.
AB  == guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (crf) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. from 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. faecal streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, citrobacter spp., c. freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the crf of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.

TI  == ferric ammonium citrate decomposition--a taxonomic tool for gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the iron uptake test of szabo and vandra has been modified and used for the differentiation of gram-negative bacteria. nutrient agar containing 20 g per litre of ferric ammonium citrate was distributed into narrow tubes and solidified so as to form butts and slants. considering the localization of the rusty-brown coloration produced after seeding and incubation, 2367 strains were classified into four groups. (1) unchanged medium: escherichia coli, shigella spp., yersinia spp., hafnia alvei and morganella morganii 100% each, klebsiella spp., 50%, enterobacter cloacae 37%, proteus vulgaris 59%, acinetobacter spp. 42%, pseudomonas fluorescens 19%, some other bacteria 2-12%. (2) rusty-brown slant, unchanged butt: salmonella subgenera ii, iii and iv 98%, citrobacter freundii 65%, e. cloacae 55%, p. vulgaris 41%, proteus mirabilis 98%, providencia rettgeri 100%, urease-negative providencia 96%, acinetobacter spp. 58%, pseudomonas aeruginosa 100%, p. fluorescens 81%, ufp (unclassified fluorescent pseudomonads)  100%, other pseudomonas spp. 55%. (3) unchanged slant, brown butt: s. typhi 88%,  salmonella subgenus i 3%, klebsiella spp. 31%, some other bacteria 2-3%. (4) rusty-brown slant, brown butt: salmonella subgenus i 75%, c. freundii 20%, klebsiella spp. 12%, some other bacteria 1-5%. colour reactions in ferric ammonium citrate agar are associated with the accumulation of ferric hydroxide: bacteria giving positive reactions on the slant took up as an average, 63 times more iron than those with negative test. the localization of colour reaction correlated partly with aerobic and anaerobic citrate utilization or decomposition in simmons' minimal and in kauffmann's peptone water medium.

TI  == inducible type i beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == mutants, showing either constitutive (depressed) or non-inducible expression of chromosomally-mediated type i beta-lactamase were obtained from clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, ent. aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the wild-type and mutant strains were compared for susceptibility to a range of beta-lactam antibiotics. derepression of beta-lactamase synthesis generally, but  not always, resulted in a marked reduction in susceptibility to the agents tested, including the '3rd generation' cephalosporins. in many cases, the observed resistance would preclude, or severely compromise, the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs. in this context, depressed mutants of enterobacter spp., citro. freundii and ps. aeruginosa could be of primary concern although those of  ser. marcescens, prov. stuartii and morg. morganii often exhibited equally high resistance levels to older beta-lactams. comparison of the susceptibilities of the non-inducible mutants with that of their inducible parents suggested variation in the beta-lactamase inductive potency of different compounds in different organisms. for example, cefoxitin was a powerful inducer in ent. cloacae, citro. freundii and one strain of ps. aeruginosa; similarly cefazolin and cefuroxime were good beta-lactamase inducers in ser. marcescens and morg. morganii. aminothiazolyl-oxime cephalosporins and ureido-penicillins were generally poor inducers. from such comparisons, the contribution of inducible type i beta-lactamase to resistance phenotype could be ascertained.

AB  == treatment failures due to beta-lactamase producing strains of enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequently reported. it is difficult, however, to determine the underlying mechanism of resistance development. different beta-lactam drugs, such as cephalosporins and penicillins have different ecological impacts on the infections and physiological flora of patients. they select in different ways although the mutation frequency of strains towards beta-lactamase production is not affected by these drugs. thus in a specific process of selection one has to consider the mechanism and frequency of changes in the beta-lactamase production, the selective power of the different drugs (relation of drug concentration to the mic for possible mutants or induction of beta-lactamase), selection of resistance in the physiological flora of patients, spread of such mutants to other patients  and in the hospital environment, and the stability of beta-lactamase production.  as each antibiotic has the potential of selecting mutants and in the case of beta-lactam drugs the more powerful ones select for mutants which produce a beta-lactamase that is more stable against less powerful drugs, a careful selection of drugs together with an effective infection control is mandatory.

TI  == in vitro studies of the synergism of piperacillin and netilmicin against blood culture isolates.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro synergism between piperacillin and netilmicin against microorganisms isolated from danish patients  with septicemia and to examine the influence of inactivation of piperacillin among these bacteria on the synergy results. a total of 132 stains was examined:  escherichia coli 20, indole-positive proteus 17, klebsiella pneumoniae 18, enterobacter cloacae 20, pseudomonas aeruginosa 20, staphylococcus aureus 20, and coagulase-negative staphylococci 17. synergy testing was performed by checkerboard titration in microtiter trays. the ability of the strains to inactivate piperacillin was examined by the clover-leaf test. synergism was found for 52% of the strains and partial synergism for 32%. antagonism was not found. of the piperacillin-resistant strains synergism could be demonstrated in 80% compared with 33% of the piperacillin-susceptible strains (p less than 0.001). no significant correlation was seen between the results of the synergy test and the  results of the susceptibility test to netilmicin. the frequency of piperacillin inactivation according to the clover-leaf test was significantly higher among the strains with synergism than among all the others (p less than 0.02). the combination of piperacillin and netilmicin gave good results concerning the in vitro synergism. this synergism was probably sometimes caused by netilmicin disturbing the bacterial production of piperacillin-inactivating proteins.

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

TI  == studies on monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. ii. synthesis and antibacterial activity of 3-acylamino-2-azetidinone-1-oxysulfonic acids.
AB  == the synthesis and in vitro antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitory activity of the 2-azetidinone-1-oxysulfonic acids having a substituent at c-4 position of  the beta-lactam ring are described. the influence of c-4 substituents on the antibacterial activity was examined for the compounds having alpha-ureidoacetyl or alpha-oxyiminoacetyl group as acyl side chain at c-3 position. the antibacterial activity is correlated with the c-4 substituents and acyl side chain. especially, 4(r)-methyl substituted derivatives exhibited excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria and 4-dimethyl substituted derivatives exhibited strong activity against resistant gram-negative bacteria except for pseudomonas aeruginosa. 39 and 40 showed strong inhibitory activity against cephalosporinase of enterobacter cloacae h-27.

TI  == in vitro activities of the quinolone antimicrobial agents a-56619 and a-56620.
AB  == the in vitro activities of two new quinolone antimicrobial agents, a-56619 and a-56620, were compared with those of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents. the activity of a-56620 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and aeromonas hydrophila (mics for 90% of the strains were less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml); acinetobacter anitratus and staphylococcus aureus (mic for 90% of the strains was 0.5 micrograms/ml); and most streptococci. against other gram-negative strains, a-56620 demonstrated activity comparable to that of norfloxacin, but the new drug was two to eight times more active than norfloxacin against gram-positive isolates. a-56620 was more active than a-56619 against most gram-negative organisms tested. of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae examined, 88% were inhibited by a-56619 and 99% by a-56620 at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. by time-kill methods, the new quinolones  were bactericidal against gram-negative bacilli during the first 6 h of incubation, but against s. aureus and enterococci the drugs were primarily bacteriostatic during this period. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to 10  micrograms of these drugs per ml was less than 10(-8) for all species tested except e. cloacae, but by serial passage through incremental concentrations of the antimicrobial agents, colonies many-fold more resistant than the initial isolate could be selected. however, resistance to concentrations of the drug greater than 100 micrograms/ml remained stable after passage on antibiotic-free media in only 1 of 35 strains tested.

TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).

AB  == solutions of clinifeed iso, triosorbon, vivonex standard (full- and half-strength) and vivonex hn were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees c and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. no increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees c. all organisms multiplied rapidly in clinifeed iso and in triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees c. there was less rapid growth in half-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, although at 37 degrees c all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two s. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength vivonex standard at both 25 and 37 degrees c. in full-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, only p. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas p. aeruginosa, k.  aerogenes and e. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees c. none of the test organisms multiplied in full strength vivonex hn at any of the temperatures studied. the results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low ph and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.

TI  == the activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefotetan compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefotetan was assessed against beta-lactamase producing  clinical isolates. the majority of enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml with 50% of isolates inhibited by less than or equal  to 1 microgram/ml. cefotetan inhibited organisms resistant to cefazolin, cefonicid and cefoperazone, but not isolates of enterobacter, citrobacter or serratia resistant to ceftizoxime. cefotetan inhibited beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, but it did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotetan was as active as cefoxitin against anaerobic species such as bacteroides fragilis and clostridium. cefotetan was not hydrolyzed by richmond-sykes plasmid beta-lactamases of type iii such as tem and shv, nor by the oxa or pse beta-lactamases. it also was not hydrolyzed by cephalosporinases of richmond-sykes type ia or id. cefotetan inhibited beta-lactamases of the type  ia and id, but it also induced these beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae and c. freundii.

TI  == carbapenems: special properties contributing to their activity.
AB  == imipenem is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits most clinical isolates of staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae, and streptococci, excluding enterococci, at 1  microgram/ml or less. resistance can develop in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, albeit infrequently. pseudomonas maltophilia is intrinsically resistant to imipenem. many strains of enterobacter cloacae, clostridium freundii, and s. marcescens resistant to the aminothiazolyl cephalosporins are susceptible to imipenem, but tend to have higher minimal inhibitory concentrations. in general, imipenem inhibits organisms resistant to other beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. imipenem  binds to pbp-2 and rapidly kills most bacteria which it inhibits. imipenem is highly stable against attack by beta-lactamases of both plasmid and chromosomal origin, and is more stable by several thousand-fold than earlier beta-lactamase stable compounds. it acts as a suicide inhibitor of beta-lactamases. imipenem does induce beta-lactamases, but the activity of imipenem against isolates containing induced beta-lactamases is not decreased and it appears not to be susceptible to the trapping that occurs with some of the cephalosporins. imipenem acts synergistically with aminoglycosides against a wide variety of bacteria, but this is most readily demonstrated for streptococcus faecalis, s. aureus, and p. aeruginosa organisms which show a difference between inhibition and killing. overall, the excellent activity of imipenem is the result of (1) the lack of a permeability barrier; (2) high affinity for pbp-2, a critical protein in cell wall synthesis in gram-negative bacteria, and for critical penicillin-binding proteins of gram-positive species; and, above all, (3) its great beta-lactamase stability.

AB  == timentin (ticarcillin (tcr) + clavulanic acid (ac)) was given for severe bacterial infections to sixteen hospitalized patients (10 male and 6 female; 16 to 75 years of age; normal renal function in 12). infections included 8 septicemias (of which 4 were secondary to pyelonephritis), 6 pyelonephritis (in addition to the four above-mentioned cases), and 3 suppurated cellulitis of the lower limbs (with septicemia in one case). the following bacteria were recovered: 10 escherichia coli, 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1 providencia stuartii, 1 salmonella typhi, 1 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 staphylococcus aureus. the sixteen strains were all susceptible to timentin (mics determined by agar dilution: tcr + ac 4 mg/l: 0.5-16 mg/l; tcr + ac 8 mg/l: 0.2-16 mg/l). thirteen strains were susceptible to tcr (mic less than or equal to 16 mg/l), and three (1 e. coli, 1 k. pneumoniae, and 1 s. aureus) were resistant  to tcr (mic greater than or equal to 256 mg/l). 14 patients received timentin alone, while two were also given dibekacin. timentin was given in one-hour iv infusions in a dosage of 9.6 g/24 h (3.2 g x 3) in 10 patients and 6.4 g/24 h (3.2 g x 2) in 6. duration of therapy was 14 to 16 days in half of cases (range 5 to 21 days). at termination of the infusion, serum concentrations of ticarcillin  and clavulanic acid (determined in ten patients) were greater than 50 mg/l and 3-7.4 mg/l respectively, and serum bactericidal activity (evaluated in ten cases) was consistently less than 1/2.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == by means of a micro-dilution technique (10(5) cfu/cup) 30 strains of pseudomonas  spp. were found resistant to sch 34343. the susceptibility of acinetobacter spp.  (20 strains) was greatest for imipenem, followed by sch 34343 (mic approximately  0.7 mg/l), ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. ten moraxella strains were very susceptible to sch 34343, imipenem and ceftazidime. for 35 strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae (ten beta-lactamase-positive) and ten strains of n. meningitidis we noted no resistance to sch 34343 (mic 0.015-0.06 mg/l), or to any of the other drugs tested. sixty-two strains of enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases were tested for their sensitivity to sch 34343 and seven other beta-lactams. to an even greater extent than imipenem and sch 34343, latamoxef and ceftazidime proved very active against all these strains. a pse-4-producing escherichia coli strain was resistant to sch 34343. the inoculum effect (10(6) vs 10(4) cfu/ml) on sch 34343 activity was usually small (1-4). tests for the beta-lactamase susceptibility of sch 34343 showed that only one pse-3, one pse-4  and one chromosomal beta-lactamase from a strain of enterobacter cloacae were slightly active.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of the penem sch 34343 was assessed in comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and imipenem. sch 34343 was active, with mics generally 2 mg/1 or less, against a broad spectrum of organisms amongst which were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci  (though enterococci were less susceptible with sch 34343 mics mostly 4-8 mg/1), anaerobes (including the bacteroides fragilis group), haemophilus influenzae and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was also active against the enterobacteriaceae though enterobacter cloacae and serratia spp. were somewhat less susceptible than other  members of this group. sch 34343 lacked useful activity against most species of pseudomonas (including ps. aeruginosa) but was active against ps. acidovorans and some isolates of ps. cepacia. sch 34343 showed a high degree of resistance to plasmid-determined and most chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases; however, it was hydrolysed rapidly by enzymes from some isolates of aeromonas hydrophila and  more slowly by enzymes from ps. maltophilia and bact. melaninogenicus subspecies  intermedius. we did not observe any reduction in sensitivity to sch 34343 for most beta-lactamase-producing organisms, including strains of enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii that were resistant to most other beta-lactams.

AB  == we investigated the feasibility of transducer head disinfection with 70% alcohol  wipes. in the initial trial, nine gas-sterilized transducers were inoculated with an estimated 5 x 10(6) organisms of a clinical isolate of enterobacter cloacae, mimicking a contaminated fluid couple. a sterile disposable transducer dome was attached to each transducer. the units were allowed to sit for 24 hours at room temperature; the domes were then removed. three transducer heads were cultured prior to disinfection to ensure that viable organisms remained. each transducer head was wiped clean with a single alcohol wipe, allowed to dry, and then cultured. all nine cultures showed growth of e. cloacae. a second series of trials with 54 transducers employed an identical protocol, except that each transducer head received not one, but two, applications of alcohol. in addition to e. cloacae (26 runs), staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans were employed in nine, nine and ten runs, respectively. cultures of 53 of 54 transducer heads showed no growth; the single positive culture was attributed to an error in technique. these preliminary results suggest that the double-alcohol-wipe technique may be an easy, cost-effective, alternative or supplemental method of transducer head disinfection. however, we do not advocate  routine implementation of this technique in patient care settings until clinical  trials confirm its safety and efficacy.

AB  == the in vitro activities of cefpiramide and apalcillin were compared with those of other third-generation cephalosporins and extended-spectrum penicillins against over 1,000 clinical bacterial isolates. the activity of cefpiramide against pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to those of piperacillin and cefoperazone,  inhibiting 90% of strains at concentrations less than or equal to 16.0 micrograms/ml. this drug was also active against a broad range of gram-negative organisms but was generally less active than many of the other cephalosporins tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the activity of cefpiramide against gram-positive organisms was comparable to that of cefoperazone. apalcillin, along with ceftazidime, was the most active agent tested against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus subsp. anitratus, inhibiting 90% of these strains at concentrations less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. against other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, its activity was similar to that of piperacillin. the activities of both cefpiramide  and apalcillin were significantly reduced by the presence of several plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in a series of otherwise isogenic strains of p.  aeruginosa in comparison with their activities against a parent strain which lacks these enzymes. many strains of enterobacter cloacae were synergistically inhibited by the combination of gentamicin with either cefpiramide (5 of 10 strains) or apalcillin (6 of 10 strains). most strains of p. aeruginosa were synergistically inhibited by the combination of gentamicin with either cefpiramide (8 of 10 strains) or apalcillin (10 of 10 strains). however, cefoxitin antagonized the activity of both cefpiramide and apalcillin against most of these same strains.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == dn-9550 [(6r, 7r)-7-[(z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1h-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the activity of dn-9550 against most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens, dn-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. dn-9550 and  ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but dn-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci and streptococci. haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to dn-9550, but bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. dn-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both  escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. when dn-9550 was administered subcutaneously  to mice experimentally infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of bmy-28142, a new extended-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of bmy-28142 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and imipenem against 639 clinical isolates and a number  of in vitro-selected resistant mutants. bmy-28142 was the most potent compound against the members of the family enterobacteriaceae with a mic for 90% of the strains of 0.12 micrograms/ml. the activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of ceftazidime and imipenem. strains of staphylococci were moderately susceptible to bmy-28142 (mic required to inhibit 90% of strains, 4 micrograms/ml), but streptococcus faecalis isolates were resistant. the activity  of the five compounds was inoculum dependent for several gram-negative species. by a single-step selection procedure, resistant mutants were selected from strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and p. aeruginosa. the mutant frequencies with the cephalosporins, including bmy-28142, ranged between 10(-6) and 10(-8). bmy-28142 was the most active cephalosporin against these resistant organisms, most of them strong beta-lactamase producers. it inhibited all mutants of c. freundii and e. cloacae at 2 micrograms/ml and all mutants of p. aeruginosa at 32 micrograms/ml. imipenem on the other hand was as active on all of these resistant organisms as on the parent strains.

TI  == affinity of carumonam for penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == direct labeling experiments with [14c]-carumonam as well as competition binding assays with [14c]-benzylpenicillin and [14c]-ceftriaxone have demonstrated that penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 3 of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa has the highest affinity for carumonam (ro 17-2301, ama-1080). pbp 1a is inhibited only at significantly higher concentration whereas other pbps display poor affinity. the ic50 values for binding to pbp 3 in e. coli and e. cloacae are in the range of the mic-values (0.1-0.4 micrograms/ml), whereas those for p. aeruginosa are much lower than the mic obtained in vitro. in accordance with the pbp affinity pattern observed for carumonam, filament formation resulted after exposure to concentrations greater than 1/2 mic. although pbp 1 and 2 of staphylococcus aureus could be titrated with radioactive  carumonam, very high concentrations were required and in line with the poor affinity for all four pbps in s. aureus, this organism is resistant to carumonam.

AB  == in a group of 27 severely ill patients in an intensive care unit, 40 infections caused by gram-negative bacilli were treated with temocillin 2g twice daily by the direct intravenous route. the patients (17 men and 10 women) were aged from 35 to 93 years (mean 65.7 years) and 22 had severe underlying diseases. in addition, 10 of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit following surgery; 6 had acute renal insufficiency, 5 had acute respiratory insufficiency,  and 12 were suffering from infectious shock. the infections included septicaemia  (19), urinary tract infection (10), respiratory tract infection (4) and biliary tract infection (4). the most frequent bacterial isolate was escherichia coli (14), followed by enterobacter cloacae (5), proteus spp. (5) and klebsiella pneumoniae (4). the initial pathogens were eliminated in 34/40 infections (85%) and the corresponding clinical cure rate was 60%, with a further 27.5% of patients being improved. in the septicaemic patients, 17/19 pathogens were eradicated from the blood, while clinically, 12 patients were cured and 5 were improved. eight of the 10 urinary tract pathogens were eliminated, with 6 patients being clinically cured and a further 3 being improved. all of the initial pathogens in both biliary tract and respiratory tract infections were eradicated, accompanied by clinical success in 3 and 2 patients, respectively; the remaining patients were improved. superinfection with streptococcus group d,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus was seen in 3 patients. the emergence of resistance to temocillin occurred in an isolate of e. coli, and also possibly in an isolate of k. pneumoniae. no adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory values related to temocillin administration were observed and, although 7 patients died, none of the deaths were attributable to uncontrolled gram-negative infection.

TI  == apalcillin [pc-904]: spectrum of activity and beta-lactamase hydrolysis/inhibition.
AB  == apalcillin is a pseudomonas-active penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of piperacillin, except for the greater potency of apalcillin against acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. studies with 846 isolates representative of the common bacterial pathogens compared apalcillin to piperacillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. apalcillin and piperacillin were both  active against all 13 species of the enterobacteriaceae that were tested (mic 50s less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) but some strains were resistant to both  penicillins. apalcillin was active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. (mic 50 less than 2.0 micrograms/ml). like other penicillins,  apalcillin was not effective against beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus spp., haemophilus spp. or neisseria gonorrhoeae. rates of hydrolysis by six beta-lactamase preparations from gram-negative bacilli were determined, comparing apalcillin, piperacillin, azlocillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin and dicloxacillin to benzyl penicillin. apalcillin and ticarcillin were more resistant than piperacillin and azlocillin to hydrolysis by the pse-2 enzyme from p. aeruginosa. as did many other penicillins, apalcillin inhibited the type 1 beta-lactamase that is produced by enterobacter cloacae. the other enzymes were inhibitory only  in very high concentrations.

TI  == temocillin. in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == temocillin, a 6-alpha-methoxy penicillin derivative, was tested in vitro against  516 recent clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae. the compound exhibited good antibacterial activity, with 95% of isolates inhibited by a range 2 to 16 mg/l. further studies, against selected isolates resistant to ticarcillin, piperacillin and cefuroxime (klebsiella oxytoca, 25; enterobacter species, 34; and citrobacter species, 5), showed about half of the isolates of k. oxytoca (11/25) to be resistant to aztreonam (mic range 16-greater than or equal to 128 mg/l), but susceptible to temocillin, cefotaxime and latamoxef. in general, the resistant strains of enterobacter species tested were not susceptible to cefotaxime (mic range 16-128 mg/l), or aztreonam (mic range 1.0-64 mg/l), and many exhibited reduced susceptibility to latamoxef (mic range 2-128 mg/l). in contrast, all the  strains were susceptible to temocillin (mic range 4-16 mg/l). the bactericidal activity of temocillin was confirmed against selected aztreonam-resistant strains of k. oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae by conventional time-kill studies, and against a strain of e. cloacae in an in vitro model system designed to simulate the temocillin concentration profiles attained in extravascular fluid such as peripheral lymph. in the time-kill studies, temocillin concentrations of 16 and 32 mg/l were shown to effectively reduce the numbers of viable bacteria by 99 and 99.9%, respectively, within 12 hours. in the in vitro model system the numbers of bacteria were reduced 99.9% over the initial 4-hour period. in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics, temocillin exerted a synergistic or partially synergistic effect (sigma fic less than or equal to 0.75) against the majority of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa tested. when combined with piperacillin, cefotaxime or latamoxef, temocillin, unlike cefoxitin, exhibited no antagonism against strains of enterobacteriaceae producing inducible cephalosporinases.

TI  == an evaluation of the bacteriolytic and biochemical properties of ceftiolene (42980rp).
AB  == ceftiolene (42980rp) is a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum similar to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. the characteristics of ceftiolene have been tested in a variety of assays involving various biochemical aspects of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. the affinities of ceftiolene for penicillin-binding proteins were very comparable with those of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for escherichia coli, and generally greater than those of latamoxef (moxalactam) for the higher molecular weight pbps of e. coli. enterobacter cloacae. proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the affinity of ceftiolene for pbp1 of staphylococcus aureus was greater than those of cefotaxime or latamoxef, but comparable with these antibiotics for pbp3. the bacteriolytic activity of ceftiolene at defined concentrations against gram-negative organisms  was similar to that of ceftriaxone, and significantly better than that of the other third-generation cephalosporins tested. introduction of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases into e. coli reduced the wide variation in bacteriolytic effect of the different cephalosporins, and a significant inoculum effect was observed for the bacteriolysis. chloramphenicol was less antagonistic against ceftiolene-  or ceftriaxone-induced lysis than was observed for cefotaxime or latamoxef. growth of staph. aureus at low concentrations of ceftiolene caused the bacteria to become more sensitive to lysis by lysostaphin than organisms grown with cefotaxime or latamoxef under the same conditions. these observations confirm the necessity to use techniques other than routine mic determinations to distinguish  between antibiotics which would otherwise appear very similar.

TI  == selection of multiple antibiotic resistance by quinolones, beta-lactams, and aminoglycosides with special reference to cross-resistance between unrelated drug classes.
AB  == the ability of three quinolones, two beta-lactams, and one aminoglycoside to select resistant mutants was examined in tests with 30 isolates of commonly encountered nosocomial pathogens. ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, two new quinolone derivatives, were no more likely to select resistant mutants than amikacin, whereas nalidixic acid, an older quinolone derivative, was the most likely of the six drugs examined to select resistant mutants. mutational frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-8) were observed in most instances. in general, the  mutants were 8 to 16 times less susceptible to the drug used for selection. although most quinolone-selected mutants were cross-resistant only to other drugs within this class, certain mutants of klebsiella pneumoniae selected by nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, or norfloxacin were also less susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. this unusual pattern of multiple drug resistance was associated with changes in outer membrane proteins of the organism. multiple drug resistance was  also observed in beta-lactam-selected mutants of enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa (beta-lactams), amikacin-selected mutants of providencia stuartii and p. aeruginosa (aminoglycosides), and beta-lactam- or amikacin-selected mutants of serratia marcescens (beta-lactams plus aminoglycosides). these results underscore the need to examine carefully the frequency with which resistance to any new antibiotic develops, as well as the patterns of multiple drug resistance which may occur simultaneously.

TI  == cephalosporin antibiotics as applied in surgery of bones and joints.
AB  == new cephalosporin antibiotics will continue to be discovered as old forms are found to lose effectiveness. cephalosporins currently account for a major part of any hospital pharmacy budget. they are often used inappropriately in treatment of both community and hospital infections. cephalosporins should be used when penicillins are not effective and for particular infections. a major use of cephalosporins is in prophylaxis; cephalosporin antibiotics will not prevent infections caused by organisms that are resistant to these compounds. infections  caused by enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are resistant to even third-generation cephalosporins and the monobactams and thienamycins, have been encountered. wound infections with a deficient blood  supply provide situations in which such organisms will grow. it is hoped that proper application of each generation of cephalosporins combined with careful surgical procedures will prevent rapid development of resistance and make it possible to have these drugs as a useful part of our armamentarium for more than  just a few years.

AB  == chemiluminescence (cl) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal cl response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated the luminol-enhanced cl response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. we analyzed  the cl response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees c.  the cl response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees c. variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced cl. each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. in the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in cl: enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and zymosan. in the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pyogenes. the cl response also reflected serum opsonic activity. the effect of inactivated complement, factor b, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak cl; however, a strain of e. coli caused a variation in  peak time rather than peak height. different cl kinetics were shown for three strains of k. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or  cell wall characteristics. this study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal cl response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.

AB  == pse-2, a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase which was previously considered pseudomonas specific, was observed in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and enterobacter cloacae. all four isolates transferred pse-2 production, together with resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole, into escherichia coli j62-1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21. transfer correlated with acquisition by the transconjugants of a 65-megadalton plasmid, and this element was considered to encode pse-2 expression. the pse-2 enzyme conferred high-level carbenicillin resistance on both j62-1 and pu21 transconjugants, although the pse-2-producing providencia stuartii isolate was susceptible to carbenicillin.

TI  == bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  == the membrane filter (mf) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified endo medium at 35 degrees c for 22 h. large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (spc) technique, can interfere with the detection of  coliforms on mf. this paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific spc bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on mf. pseudomonas aeruginosa and aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. the flavobacterium sp. and bacillus sp. selected for this study from spc did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. excessive crowding of e. coli and enterobacter cloacae colonies on mf also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. even when  there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the e. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified endo medium.

TI  == femoral artery infection complicating intraaortic balloon pumping.
AB  == infection of the femoral artery (endarteritis) complicating intraaortic balloon pumping has not been reported. most reports of complications with this pump have  not emphasized wound infection. whether the balloon is inserted by open or percutaneous technique, infection remains a problem. during the past 7 years, 32  of 50 patients (64 percent) who had intraaortic balloon pump insertion survived balloon removal. in four patients, wound infection of the groin developed with involvement of the femoral artery. sepsis was due to p. aeruginosa in three patients and e. cloacae in one. all patients required variable degrees of resection of the infected femoral artery wall. one had successful arterial reconstruction with vein patch angioplasty alone after debridement of the vessel  wall. in a second patient, resection of the common femoral artery with interposition of a saphenous vein that had been reconstructed to enhance its diameter to that of the femoral artery was accomplished. dehiscence of a vein patch angioplasty occurred in the remaining two patients with resultant hemorrhage. further resection of the femoral artery was required with femoro-femoral saphenous vein grafting in one patient and iliofemoral vein grafting in another. tissue coverage of the reconstructed vessel was best accomplished using a tensor fascis lata myocutaneous flap. all patients survived  the infection without amputation.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of cefoperazone].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefoperazone (cpz) against clinical isolates including various beta-lactamase-producing strains were studied and compared with those of cefotiam (ctm). cpz had a broad spectrum against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. especially, cpz showed apparently more  potent antibacterial activities than ctm against enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, cpz was less active than ctm against staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. the stability and affinity of cpz for various types of beta-lactamase were also studied. cpz was more resistant to hydrolysis by typical cephalosporinase (csase) and cefuroximase (cxase) than ctm, but was less stable to penicillinase (pcase). cpz often showed  higher affinity to beta-lactamases than ctm. the study for the inducer-activity revealed that cpz hardly induced csase production in e. cloacae and proteus vulgaris while ctm highly induced in both strains. cpz was more active against csase-producers than ctm, especially against strains which inducibly produced the enzyme. it was speculated that this activity was responsible for the superior stability to csase and low inducer-activity for csase production.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  == the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle (16b; johnston laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. however, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. this in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16b to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16b and the 6b (conventional aerobic) bottles. the studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16b bottles. low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly.  the indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. the failure of the bactec 16b blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.

AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

TI  == in vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-pseudomonas cephalosporins.
AB  == apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone  against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against citrobacter freundii and citrobacter diversus. against klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. the activity of apalcillin against enterobacter (e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. the activity of apalcillin against proteus mirabilis was similar to  that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive proteus and providencia. only 40% of serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. it was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). there was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.

TI  == antagonism of carbenicillin and cefamandole by cefoxitin in treatment of experimental infections in mice.
AB  == the ability of cefoxitin to antagonize the in vivo efficacy of cefamandole and carbenicillin as predicted by in vitro assays was analyzed in experimental infections in mice. cefoxitin was administered in a nonprotective dose either at  the time of challenge or simultaneously with the protective drug, 1 and 3.5 h postchallenge. in mice infected with enterobacter cloacae, median 50% protective  doses of cefamandole and carbenicillin were markedly increased by cefoxitin, especially when the latter was given at the time of challenge. the antagonistic effect was also associated with increased numbers of challenge bacteria present in animal heart blood within a 6.5-h period after infection. in infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefoxitin antagonized carbenicillin; however, the effect  was less dramatic than that seen with e. cloacae. antagonism in this model was pronounced with simultaneous administration of antagonizing and protective drugs. the antagonistic effects observed in all in vivo tests were not due to the selection of stable resistance to the protective drugs, but appeared to be due to a reversible induction of beta-lactamases by cefoxitin.

TI  == [gram negative bacilli endocarditis ].
AB  == gram negative bacilli endocarditis are unfrequent. nevertheless we encountered 28 cases of them (8.8%) among 320 endocarditis of which 10 were primitive and 7 cases (10.9%) among 65 prosthetic endocarditis. bacterial species were 12 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 ps, stutzeri, 1 ps. maltophilia, 2 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 escherichia coli, 3 serratia marcescans, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1  brucella, 1 hemophilus aphrophilus, 1 fusobacterium funduliformis, 18 cases were  hospital acquired infections related to cardiac surgery (4 cases), intracardiac catheterization (5 cases), intravenous catheter (4 cases). uncontrolled infection or cardiac insufficiency underwent respectively in 14 and 18 cases. the overall mortality was 50 p. cent. the death occurred more frequently in primitive endocarditis (70%) than in secondary native endocarditis (45%) or prosthetic endocarditis (29%). it was also more frequent in pseudomonas endocarditis (59%) than with other species (36%) and more frequent when cardiac sufficiency was present (50%). 15 patients underwent surgical procedure of which 6 died (40%). the results were better if the infection was cured before surgical procedures: 5  deaths occurred when the culture of the valves remained positive (9 cases) but none when it was negative. the 5 most recent cases of prosthetic endocarditis were cured. since 1979, no death occurred among treated patients. we concluded that surgery is usually necessary but after an effective antibiotic therapy over  a 4 or 6 week period.

TI  == mode of action of azthreonam.
AB  == azthreonam (sq 26,776) is a member of a new class of monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. in escherichia coli, azthreonam caused filamentation at its lowest effective concentration (0.2 microgram/ml), a morphological effect identical to that observed with cephalothin. the penicillin-binding protein (pbp) profile indicated a very high affinity for pbp3 (complete binding at 0.1 microgram/ml), a moderate affinity for pbp1a (complete binding at 10 micrograms/ml), and poor affinities for pbp1b, pbp2, pbp4, and pbp5/6 (complete binding at greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml). accordingly, azthreonam had poor activity against streptomyces r61 dd-carboxypeptidase (50% inhibition, greater than 100 micrograms/ml) and e. coli peptidoglycan transpeptidase (50% inhibition, 100 micrograms/ml). azthreonam also showed very high affinity for pbp3 (complete binding at 0.1 microgram/ml) in proteus vulgaris, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in all four organisms, its pbp profile was similar to that observed in e. coli. it is concluded that azthreonam, although of novel structure, has a mode of action similar to that of cephalosporins, affecting specifically septation in e. coli and most likely other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == trapping of nonhydrolyzable cephalosporins by cephalosporinases in enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa as a possible resistance mechanism.
AB  == resistance to cefotaxime (cta) and ceftriaxone (ctr) in enterobacter cloacae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated in several strains which are susceptible  or resistant to these agents. all strains produced a chromosomally mediated cephalosporinase of the richmond type 1. beta-lactamases in susceptible strains were inducible, whereas resistant strains produced the enzymes constitutively. cta and ctr were very poor substrates but potent inhibitors of all enzymes. binding to, rather than hydrolysis by, beta-lactamases was assumed to be a major  reason for resistance, and combination experiments supported this assumption. dicloxacillin, which did not inhibit the growth and which was a poor inducer but  a strong inhibitor of these beta-lactamases, exerted strong synergistic activity  when combined with cta or ctr in strains which produced large amounts of beta-lactamase constitutively. cefoxitin, on the other hand, poorly active alone, but a good inducer, strongly antagonized cta or ctr in susceptible strains producing inducible enzymes. in marked contrast to cta and ctr were the findings  with cefsulodin. cefsulodin was active against cta- and ctr-resistant pseudomonas, and its activity was hardly influenced by dicloxacillin or cefoxitin. since cefsulodin was found to have a very low affinity for all cephalosporinases, these findings corroborate the assumption that binding of nonhydrolyzable cephalosporins, rather than hydrolysis by cephalosporinases, may  play an important role in resistance to these agents and other newer cephalosporins in enterobacteriaceae, as well as in other gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == rapid identification of haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (glc) of the metabolic by-products in  broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in new zealand white male rabbits. these results were correlated with the glc of csf of meningitis patients. a major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including h. influenzae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and listeria monocytogenes. succinic acid was also found in the csf of experimental meningitis and in the csf of all patients with h. influenzae and  esch. coli meningitis. this peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. it was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria meningitidis. succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in h. influenzae meningitis for at  least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. in one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by glc in the csf excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests h. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.

TI  == efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  == ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. the bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. there were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. no serious drug toxicities were observed. at a dosage regimen of 1 g  every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.

AB  == thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. pathogenic isolates included 13 serratia marcescens, 12 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 escherichia coli, 2 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia stuartii, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1 haemophilus influenzae, 1 enterococcus, and 1 staphylococcus aureus. of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. superinfection was seen in one patient. the emergence  of resistance was documented in another patient. of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. of 12 patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  == the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8  mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode  mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected  by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the  species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones  or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

AB  == a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative, 6059-s, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. twenty-five patients were treated with 10 to 274 mg/kg per day of 6059-s by intravenous administrations. the diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5  patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. the pathogens recovered were streptococcus pneumoniae (1), haemophilus influenzae (4), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), enterobacter aerogenes (1), proteus morganii (1), psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and salmonella typhimurium (1). all the  patients of bacterial infections were cured after the 6059-s therapy. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium were not eradicated after the 6059-s therapy, and the rate of bacterial disappearance was 75%. diarrhea (3), precordial pain (2, only in cases with high-dose therapy), transient elevation of got and gpt (2), and transient eosinophilia (2) were found to be associated with  the 6059-s therapy. however, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. half life of the serum 6059-s level was 1.34 +/- 0.16 hours. csf concentrations in a case with haemophilus influenzae meningitis ranged 4.0 to 9.7 mcg/ml after an intravenous injection of 34.3 to 75 mg/kg of 6059-s. from the present study, 6059-s appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections. it remains to be further determined whether 6059-s is superior to abpc in the treatment of haemophilus influenzae meningitis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365).
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime  required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to  8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited  78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics  for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae  and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [cefotaxime csf levels in children with purulent meningitis (author's transl)].
AB  == cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the c.s.f. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae,  escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. compared to the m.i.c. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the c.s.f. are much higher than the m.i.c.'s. these results are comparable to those of previous studies. cefotaxime diffuses in the c.s.f. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against  haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904 was assessed against clinical isolated of common bacteria. its activity against most enterobacteria was similar to that of  cefotaxime and moxalactam, but it was even more active than these compounds against all proteus species. it was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producers. like cefotaxime and moxalactam, or 13-9904 was approximately eightfold more active than carbenicillin against most isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and also active against highly carbenicillin-resistant isolates, but it was relatively inactive against moderately carbenicillin-resistant isolates. ro 13-9904 also resembled cefotaxime and moxalactam in that it was active, though less so than cephaloridine, against staphylococci and streptococci, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis, which were resistant to it. it was less active than cefoxitin but slightly more active than  ampicillin against both bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. ro 13-9904 was resistant to most beta-lactamases but was attacked by enzymes from b. fragilis, isolates of indole-positive proteus species, and also by a cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme from an isolate of enterobacter cloacae.

AB  == two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. the pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to autobac i (pfizer inc.) instructions. various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial  inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form  16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. in the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. these results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per  ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of cefoperazone (t-1551), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin.
AB  == cefoperazone, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it is as active as cefazolin and cefamandole against gram-positive bacteria and is more active than cefazolin and cefamandole against  such gram-negative bacilli as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and  serratia marcescens. the superiority of cefoperazone over cefazolin and cefamandole with respect to activity against p. aeruginosa by more than 200-fold  was especially remarkable. as with other beta-lactam antibiotics, there was only  a small spread between the minimum inhibitory concentrations and the minimum bactericidal concentrations of cefoperazone and a significant decrease in activity with an increase in inoculum size. activity was not altered significantly by the addition of human serum to the test medium. cefoperazone is  relatively stable to hydrolysis to beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative bacteria. relative rates of hydrolysis of cefoperazone by cephalosporinases are 7.0 to 0.01, with reference to cephaloridine hydrolysis (base, 100). cefoperazone is also more stable than penicillin g and cephaloridine to various types of penicillinases.

AB  == as a means to development of guidelines for therapeutic application to human disease, preparations of human polyvalent gamma-globulin immune to pseudomonas aeruginosa (pg) were studied in acute infections in mice. pg was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of p. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse  protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of  p. aeruginosa. pg was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. the active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the igg type and undoubltedly is directed against the o-antigen. pg was was not protective against challenge with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, or klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against serratia marcescens. in a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced p. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to p. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. the apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. it is postulated that  the successful treatment of advanced p. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.

AB  == six patients with acute gram-negative bronchopulmonary infection were treated with amikacin (15 mg/kg per day) administered intramuscularly in two equal doses  at 12-hr intervals for 10-13 days. two patients had underlying nonspecific pulmonary disease, two had advanced bronchocarcinoma, and two had extensive bronchiectasis (due to chronic aspergillosis in one patient). the pathogens were  pseudomonas aeruginosa in three patients, and haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  ozaenae, and enterobacter cloacae each in one patient. five patients recovered completely, with resolution of fever and other acute symptoms and elimination of  the causative organism from sputum cultures. a moribund patient with advanced metastatic bronchocarcinoma died two days after the treatment with amikacin had been completed; the last specimen of sputum was still positive for p. aeruginosa. tests of liver and renal function and blood counts revealed no abnormaltities. complete audiometric survey showed no hearing loss. nystagmography revealed reversible, lessened caloric response in some patients. amikacin was well absorbed from the site of intramuscular injection. levels of amikacin in serum varied among the subjects and, in some cases, for individual patients on different days.

TI  == [approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  == in this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. this system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (ph-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (uripret-g). a total of 130 cultures was investigated. the employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. they included the following species: candida albicans, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus inconstans, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium. employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.

TI  == susceptibility of clinically important gram-negative bacilli to 15 antibiotics. comparison of patterns in poland and federal republic of germany.
AB  == three hundred and sixty strains of gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae, providencia, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens), were isolated by random in poland and germany, and tested by agar dilution method for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents, including  six cephalosporin derivatives, colistin, gentamycin and tobramycin, three newer tetracyclines, ampicillin and carbenicillin, and a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. this investigation revealed existence of growing antibiotic-resistance of gram-negative bacilli to all antimicrobial agents. a detailed analysis of this problem is described and a list of agents effective in  vitro is presented. some evidence has been found concerning possible existence of geographical differences in antibiotic-susceptibility patterns of strains of gram-negative bacilli, isolated in poland and federal republic of germany.

TI  == the fate of bacteria in frozen red cells.
AB  == units of blood were intentionally contaiminated with suspensions of either aerobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, enterobacter cloacae,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, sarcina lutea, seratia marcesens, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, paracolabacterum aerogenoides (enterobacter  hafriae), mima polymorpha or acinetobacter- calcoaceticus. when inoculation was made prior to glycerolization, the subsequent glycerolization, freezing, thawing, and deglycerolization resulted in roughly a two log reduction in the number of bacteria. when inoculation was made with a final concentration of between 10(1) and 10(5) organisms per milliliter, immediately following deglycerolization or following washing without glycerolization and freezing, no increase in the number of bacteria was seen after 72 hours storage at 4 c. three of the 12 organisms studied decreased in number during 72 hours of storage. these data suggest that the current 24-hour limit on the post-thaw storage of frozen red blood cells may  be unnecessarily restrictive.

TI  == disinfection procedures of fiberscopes in endoscopy departments.
AB  == disinfection of fibre endoscopes was examined in 5 endoscopy departments during endoscopy sessions. on the endoscopes, especially in the instrument channels, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus species could be regularly found, in some cases also enterobacter cloacae and candida albicans. with the results of disinfection experiments, proposals are made to reduce the infection risk due to  insufficiently disinfected instruments in endoscopy departments.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  == in a period of two years, 865 strains of gram-negative bacilli other than pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. the commonest species were proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and enterobacter  cloacae. many strains of klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes, and bacterium anitratum were also found.a large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. the proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different  antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. a large proportion of the strains of e. coli and p. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. multiple resistance occurred less  often among strains of e. coli than among klebsiella spp, enterobacter spp, and p. mirabilis. phage and serological typing of ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.

TI  == occurrence of chloramphenicol-acetylating enzymes in various gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the occurrence of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme, similar to that found in  escherichia coli, carrying an r factor was investigated in various gram-negative  bacilli. the acetylated products of chloramphenicol were identified by chromatography and quantitatively assayed after benzene extraction. the investigated strains were of the salmonella-arizona group, the klebsiella-aerobacter group, serratia marcescens, the proteus group, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, most of which were isolated from 1947 to 1957. both chloramphenicol-sensitive and -resistant strains were included, but none of them  was able to transfer chloramphenicol resistance by conjugation. in the proteus group, a significant level of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme was found in most strains, whether they were sensitive or resistant to chloramphenicol; the resistant strains showed higher levels of the enzyme. some chloramphenicol-sensitive strains lacked this enzyme. only the sensitive strains  containing the enzyme could easily produce chloramphenicol-resistant mutants with higher enzyme activity. thus, the chloramphenicol resistance of this group can be reasonably explained on the basis of the chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme. all  of the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, and most strains showed low levels of the enzyme (which, however, did not appear sufficient to explain their resistance). all of the strains of the other groups (except one strain of enterobacter cloacae) lacked the enzyme, although most strains of the klebsiella-aerobacter group and of s. marcescens were resistant to chloramphenicol. with respect to the origin of the resistance gene of the r factor, it is noteworthy that the strains of proteus mirabilis isolated in 1947 possessed this enzyme before the discovery of chloramphenicol.

TI  == effect of naturally occurring xanthines on bacteria. i. antimicrobial action and  potentiating effect on antibiotic spectra.
AB  == the effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. the antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. the effect was both bacteriostatic and  bactericidal against susceptible organisms. the susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. the morphology of aerobacter  aerogenes and a. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. this potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.
