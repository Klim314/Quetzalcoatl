TI  == bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis decreases urinary oxalate excretion in a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria.
AB  == hyperoxaluria significantly increases the risk of calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. since several bacteria have been shown to metabolize oxalate in vitro, including probiotic bifidobacteria, we focused on the efficiency and possible mechanisms by which bifidobacteria can influence oxalate handling in vivo, especially in the intestines, and compared these results with the reported effects of oxalobacter formigenes. bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dsm 10140 and b. adolescentis atcc 15703 were administered to wild-type (wt) mice and to mice deficient in the hepatic enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (agxt(-/-), a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria) that were fed an oxalate-supplemented diet. the administration of b. animalis subsp. lactis led to a significant decrease in urinary oxalate excretion in wt and agxt(-/-) mice when compared to treatment with b. adolescentis. detection of b. animalis subsp. lactis in feces revealed that 3 weeks after oral gavage with the bacteria 64% of  wt mice, but only 37% of agxt(-/-) mice were colonized. examining intestinal oxalate fluxes showed there were no significant changes to net oxalate secretion  in colonized animals and were therefore not associated with the changes in urinary oxalate excretion. these results indicate that colonization with b. animalis subsp. lactis decreased urinary oxalate excretion by degrading dietary oxalate thus limiting its absorption across the intestine but it did not promote  enteric oxalate excretion as reported for o. formigenes. preventive or therapeutic administration of b. animalis subsp. lactis appears to have some potential to beneficially influence dietary hyperoxaluria in mice.

TI  == isomer-specific consumption of galactooligosaccharides by bifidobacterial species.
AB  == prebiotics are nondigestible substrates that stimulate the growth of beneficial microbes in the human intestine. galactooligosaccharides (gos) are food ingredients that possess prebiotic properties, in particular, promoting the growth of bifidobacteria in situ. however, precise mechanistic details of gos consumption by bifidobacteria remain poorly understood. because gos are mixtures  of polymers of different lengths and linkages, there is interest in determining which specific structures provide prebiotic effects to potentially create better  supplements. this paper presents a method comprising porous graphitic carbon separation, isotopic labeling, and mass spectrometry analysis for the structure-specific analysis of gos isomers and their bacterial consumption rate.  using this strategy, the differential bacterial consumption of gos by the bifidobacteria species bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and bifidobacterium adolescentis was determined, indicating that the use of specific gos isomers in infant formula may provide enrichment of distinct species.

TI  == cholesterol-lowering probiotics: in vitro selection and in vivo testing of bifidobacteria.
AB  == thirty-four strains of bifidobacteria belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis,  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseu-docatenulatum were assayed in vitro for the ability to assimilate cholesterol and for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) against glycocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids (gca and tdca). cholesterol assimilation was peculiar characteristic of two strains belonging to the species  b. bifidum (b. bifidum mb 107 and b. bifidum mb 109), which removed 81 and 50 mg  of cholesterol per gram of biomass, being the median of specific cholesterol absorption by bifidobacteria 19 mg/g. significant differences in bsh activities were not established among bifidobacterial species. however, the screening resulted in the selection of promising strains able to efficiently deconjugate gca and tdca. no relationship was recognized between bsh phenotype and the extent of cholesterol assimilation. on the basis of cholesterol assimilation or bshgca and bshtdca activities, b. bifidum mb 109 (dsmz 23731), b. breve mb 113 (dsmz 23732), and b. animalis subsp. lactis mb 2409 (dsmz 23733) were combined in a probiotic mixture to be fed to hypercholesterolemic rats. the administration of this probiotic formulation resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol (ldl-c), whereas it did not affect high-density cholesterol (hdl-c) and hdl-c/ldl-c ratio.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == short communication: identification and differentiation of bifidobacteria obtained from ukraine.
AB  == ten freeze-dried bifidobacterial strains used as probiotics in ukrainian dairy foods, identified by the supplier as bifidobacterium adolescentis (2), bifidobacterium bifidum (2), bifidobacterium longum (4), bifidobacterium animalis (1), and bifidobacterium infantis (1), were characterized. following rehydration  and anaerobic growth on de man, rogosa, and sharpe-cysteine medium at 37 degrees  c for 72 h, single-colony isolates were picked and evaluated using pcr primers specific for the bifidobacterium genus, for the supplier-identified species, and  for b. animalis ssp. lactis. all isolates were identified as members of the genus bifidobacterium; however, species-specific pcr revealed all 10 isolates were actually strains of b. animalis ssp. lactis. further evaluation using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was only able to separate a single strain (rt 09) from the other 9 strains evaluated. application of genome-wide allelic profiling to the ukrainian bifidobacterial strains revealed 4 distinct groups. interestingly, 6 (60%) of the isolates fell into the same cluster as that containing the common commercial probiotic strain bb-12. two of the strains (rt 02 and rt 09) were found to be in the same group as atcc 27536 and one strain (rt 08) was in the same group as the rb 7239 (a previously evaluated commercial strain). one strain, rt 04, was placed on a unique branch. these results highlight the importance of employing routine typing of bifidobacterial isolates, demonstrate the utility of single nucleotide polymorphism/insertion-deletion polymorphism-based allelic typing in b. animalis ssp. lactis strain differentiation and further point to the limited genetic variability of b. animalis ssp. lactis strains and the worldwide distribution of a small number of  commercial strains.

TI  == genetic analysis and morphological identification of pilus-like structures in members of the genus bifidobacterium.
AB  == background: cell surface pili in gram positive bacteria have been reported to orchestrate the colonization of host tissues, evasion of immunity and the development of biofilms. so far, little if any information is available on the presence of pilus-like structures in human gut commensals like bifidobacteria. results and discussion: in this report, atomic force microscopy (afm) of various  bifidobacterial strains belonging to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis revealed the existence of appendages resembling pilus-like structures. interestingly, these microorganisms harbour two to six predicted pilus gene clusters in their genome, with each organized in an operon encompassing the major pilin subunit-encoding gene (designated fima or fimp) together with one or two minor pilin subunit-encoding genes (designated as  fimb and/or fimq), and a gene encoding a sortase enzyme (stra). quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr analysis and rt-pcr experiments revealed a polycistronic mrna, encompassing the fima/p and fimb/q genes, which are differentially expressed upon cultivation of bifidobacteria on various glycans.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == intestinal bacteroides species associated with coeliac disease.
AB  == aims: to characterise the predominant species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. methods: 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease,  12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations were analysed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. results: bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis/bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p<0.05). bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p<0.01). bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p<0.01). bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. a higher lab diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and controls than in patients with active coeliac disease. weissella spp and lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected  in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls and patients with active coeliac disease. conclusions: bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lab populations in the duodenum of spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == [screening and identification of probiotic bifidobacterium from mongolian children].
AB  == objective: bifidobacterium has important physiological activity in gastrointestinal tract of human and animals, and the tolerability of acid, intestinal juice and oxgall bile salt are the key factors that influence the function of living bacteria preparation. in this study, feces of 12 healthy mongolian children were selected to isolate bifidobacterium with probiotic properties. methods: bifidobacterium was isolated from feces by selective medium  and identified by physiological biochemical test. the tolerability of acid, intestinal juice and oxgall bile salt of 11 bfidobacteria were studied and b. animalis v9 was identified further by molecular biological approach 16s rdna. results: eleven bifidobacteria isolated from feces of 12 healthy mongolian children were identified as b. adolescentis (a1, h3, g4, a8 and v10), b. longum (c6, c7 and d11), b. pseudocatenlatum (b2), b. bifidum (g5), b. animalis (v9). b. animalis v9 had the best acid tolerance with the survival rate 92.4% in artificial gastric juice at ph2.0 for 3h, whereas others had lower than 31.25%. b. animalis v9 also had good survival rate (99.7%) in artificial intestinal juice at ph8.0 for 8h after anaerobic cultured 3h in artificial gastric juice at ph2.0, and tolerated oxgall bile salt at concentration of 0.3%. b. animalis v9 was identified further by molecular biological approach 16s rdna and result showed the homologies of b. animalis v9 was 99% with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactic bb12. conclusion: b. animalis v9 had good probiotic properties to be potentiallyused in dairy products and health products.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == a bifidobacterium mixed-species microarray for high resolution discrimination between intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == a genomic dna-based microarray was constructed containing over 6000 randomly cloned genomic fragments of approximately 1-2 kb from six mammalian intestinal bifidobacterium spp. including b. adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. catenulatum, b. longum and b. pseudolongum. this bifidobacterium mixed-species (bms) microarray was used to differentiate between type strains and isolates belonging to a set of nine bifidobacterium spp. hierarchical clustering of genomic hybridization data confirmed the grouping of the bifidobacterium spp. according to the 16s rrna-based phylogenetic clusters. in addition, these genomic hybridization experiments revealed high homology between the type-strain b. animalis subsp. lactis lmg18314 and b. animalis subsp. animalis lmg10508 (79%) as well as between the type strains b. longum biotype longum lmg13197 and b. longum  biotype infantis lmg8811 (72%) - nevertheless, discrimination between these species was possible due to the high resolution output of the bms-array. in addition, it was shown that the bms-array could be used for assigning unknown bifidobacterium isolates to a species group. finally, a set of 54 diagnostic clones for bifidobacterium identification was selected and sequenced to advance the understanding of the species-related differences. remarkably, a large fraction (31%) of these was predicted to encode proteins that belong to the bifidobacterial glycobiome and another 11% had functional homology with genes involved in the protection against foreign dna. overall, the bms-microarray is a  high-resolution diagnostic tool that is able to facilitate the detection of strain- and species-specific characteristics of bifidobacteria.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

TI  == bifidobacterium microbiota and parameters of immune function in elderly subjects.
AB  == faecal and serum samples were collected over a period of 6 months from 55 institutionalized elderly subjects, who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. participants were randomized in one of the three treatment groups: intervention (two probiotic bifidobacterium longum strains: 2c  and 46), placebo and commercial control (bifidobacterium lactis bb-12). the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota was characterized by genus and species-specific pcr. serum levels of the cytokines il-10, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. each participant harboured on average approximately three different bifidobacterial species. the most frequently detected species were b. longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium bifidum. depending on the treatment, the intervention resulted in specific changes in the levels of certain bifidobacterium species, and positive correlations were found between the different species. negative correlations were observed between the levels of bifidobacterium species and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha and the regulatory cytokine il-10. the presence of faecal b. longum and bifidobacterium animalis correlated with reduced serum il-10. the anti-inflammatory tgf-beta1 levels were increased over time in all three groups, and the presence of bifidobacterium breve correlated with higher serum tgf-beta1 levels. this indicates that modulation of the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota may provide a  means of influencing inflammatory responses.

TI  == evaluation of the pcr method for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == aims: bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. although various polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods for the identification of bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. methods and results: in this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported pcr primer sets designed to amplify 16s rdna, 23s rdna, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive  dna sequences of various bifidobacterium species. conclusions: ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. longum biovar infantis and b. dentium. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest that published bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of bifidobacterium species using pcr. improvement of existing pcr methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other bifidobacterium strains, such as b. animalis, b. catenulatum, b. thermophilum and b. subtile.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bifidobacterial microbiota in the colonic mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer, diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == aim: to characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis. methods: a sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for their condition.  bacterial dna was extracted from the resected mucosal samples and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative pcr. results: bifidobacteria were found in  100% of the samples from patients with diverticulitis or ibd and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. the species b. longum and b. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by b. animalis, b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis. b. breve, b.  dentium and b. angulatum were not detected in any sample. a significantly higher  occurrence of b. longum was observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or ibd (100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, p < 0.05). similar results were obtained for b. animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, p < 0.05), while  b. adolescentis was only found in the mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). at the quantitative level, patients with colon cancer or ibd showed lower counts of total bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, p < 0.05) and of the species b. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, p < 0.05) than those with diverticulitis. conclusion: aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different intestinal diseases. this may indicate a role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

TI  == bifidobacterium species isolated from animal feces and from beef and pork meat.
AB  == bifidobacteria were isolated from 122 of 145 samples of animal feces (from cattle, swine, sheep, goats, horses, rabbits, chickens, geese, and pigeons) from  farms in france and austria and from 92 of 955 production and processing chain samples of beef and pork (obtained at slaughter, cutting, and retail). bacterial  strains were identified to species by phenotypic numerical classification based on api 50ch and id 32a tests and dna-dna hybridization. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was present in 81% (99 of 122 samples) of all bifidobacterium-positive fecal samples and predominated in samples from all animal species except those from swine from austria. in these austrian swine samples, the majority of strains were identified as bifidobacterium thermophilum  (78%), followed by b. pseudolongum (48%). the distribution of b. thermophilum and b. pseudolongum differed significantly between austrian swine and cattle samples  such as those collected along beef and pork production and processing chains. bifidobacterium animalis was isolated from swine feces, and bifidobacterium ruminantium was isolated from cow dung. six fecal isolates (from cattle, swine, rabbits, goats, and horses) were identified as belonging to bifidobacterium species of predominantly human origin: b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, and b. catenulatum. only one other species, bifidobacterium choerinum, was detected with low frequency in a pork processing chain. b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum was predominant in pig feces, whereas b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum was predominant in feces from other animal species. four strains closely related to both subspecies (58 to 61% dna reassociation) formed a distinct genomic group. pcr techniques, which are more rapid and sensitive than culture-based methods, could  be used to detect directly b. pseudolongum and b. thermophilum as indicators of fecal contamination along the meat processing chain.

TI  == determination of survival, identity and stress resistance of probiotic bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts.
AB  == aims: to determine the level of bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts in the uk, identify the species, and compare the resistance of common bifidobacterium spp. to acidity and oxidative stress. methods and results: a storage trial of bio-yoghurts was carried out to determine the level and survival of bifidobacteria. the 16s rrna gene targeted pcr was used to identify the species.  acid tolerance was determined by introducing the organisms to ph-adjusted skimmed milk and enumerating during storage at 4 degrees c. oxidative stress resistance was determined using the h(2)o(2) disc diffusion assay technique. nine of 10 bio-yoghurts contained bifidobacteria at levels >10(6) cfu g(-1) at the time of purchase. the viability of the organism decreased during storage and on expiry only five products retained viability >10(6) cfu g(-1) while two others were very close to the target population. bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis showed superior survival abilities and stress tolerance compared with bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum biotype infantis. conclusions: bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, the only bifidobacterium spp. found in bio-yoghurts, had the greatest resistance to acidity and oxidative stress. significance and impact of the study: the technological properties of b. animalis ssp. lactis make it suitable for inclusion in bio-yoghurts although its putative  health benefits need further investigation.

AB  == in order to characterize the genus bifidobacterium, ribopatterns and approximately 500 bp (escherichia coli positions 27 to 520) of 16s rrna gene sequences of 28 type strains and 64 reference strains of the genus bifidobacterium were determined. ribopatterns obtained from bifidobacterium strains were divided into nine clusters (clusters i-ix) with a similarity of 60%. cluster v, containing 17 species, was further subdivided into 22 subclusters with a similarity of 90%. in the genus bifidobacterium, four groups were shown according to miyake et al.: (i) the bifidobacterium longum infantis-longum-suis type group, (ii) the b. catenulatum-pseudocatenulatum group, (iii) the b. gallinarum-saeculare-pullorum group, and (iv) the b. coryneforme-indicum group, which showed higher than 97% similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequences in each group. using ribotyping analysis, unique ribopatterns were obtained from these species, and they could be separated by cluster analysis. ribopatterns of six b.  adolescentis strains were separated into different clusters, and also showed diversity in 16s rrna gene sequences. b. adolescentis consisted of heterogeneous  strains. the nine strains of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum were divided into five subclusters. each type strain of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum and b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum and two intermediate groups, which were suggested by yaeshima et al., consisted of individual clusters. b. animalis subsp. animalis and b. animalis subsp. lactis could not be separated by ribotyping using eco ri. we conclude that ribotyping is able to provide another characteristic of bifidobacterium strains in addition to 16s rrna gene sequence phylogenetic analysis, and this information suggests that ribotyping analysis is  a useful tool for the characterization of bifidobacterium species in combination  with other techniques for taxonomic characterization.

TI  == evaluation of amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) and species-specific pcr for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == molecular biological methods based on genus-specific pcr, species-specific pcr, and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) of two pcr amplicons (523 and 914bp) using six restriction enzymes were used to differentiate among species of bifidobacterium. the techniques were established using dna from 16 type and reference strains of bifidobacteria of 11 species. the discrimination power of 914bp amplicon digestion was higher than that of 523bp amplicon digestion. the 914bp amplicon digestion by six restrictases provided unique patterns for nine species; b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were not differentiated yet. the ncii digestion of the 914bp pcr product enabled to discriminate between each of b. animalis, b. lactis, and b. gallicum. the reference strain b. adolescentis ccm 3761 was reclassified as a member of the b.  catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum group. the above-mentioned methods were applied  for the identification of seven strains of bifidobacterium spp. collected in the  culture collection of dairy microorganisms (ccdm). the strains collected in ccdm  were differentiated to the species level. six strains were identified as b. lactis, one strain as b. adolescentis.

TI  == rapid identification of potentially probiotic bifidobacterium species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s rrna.
AB  == this study aimed at developing a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  primer set for identification of the potentially probiotic bifidobacterium species b. adolescentis, b. animalis subsp. animalis (b. animalis), b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum biovar infantis (b. infantis), b. animalis subsp. lactis b. lactis, b. longum biovar longum (b. longum) and b. pseudolongum. the primer set comprised specific and conserved primers and was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna genes and the rrna intergenic spacer region (isr) of each species. it could detect and identify type strains and isolates from pharmaceuticals or dairy products corresponding to the eight bifidobacterium species with high specificity. it was also useful for screening of the related strains from natural sources such as the gastro-intestinal tract and feces. we suggest that the assay system from this study is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of bifidobacterium species for which probiotic  strains are known.

TI  == genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from  intestinal samples of finnish adult subjects. methods and results: a total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. identification results obtained with pcr-elisa and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly  amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) gave tentative identification only to bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the b. longum isolates. the most commonly detected species were b. longum biotype longum followed by b. adolescentis and b. bifidum. in addition, b. animalis (lactis), b. angulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were found. ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also rapd revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. besides two b. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. conclusions: several species/strains of bifidobacteria  simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy finnish adults and  intestinal bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. significance and impact of the study: applicability of ribotyping with the automated riboprinter system for  identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.

TI  == interaction of bifidobacteria with the gut and their influence in the immune function.
AB  == bifidobacteria are predominant in the lumen of the large intestine and confer various health benefits on the host. they are also used in the preparation of new fermented milks (bioyogurts) or added to conventional yogurt to generate probiotic effects. the colonization of the gut by bacteria tends to be host specific due partly to the way in which bacteria adhere to the intestinal wall. using a homologous strain of bifidobacterium animalis in an experimental mouse model, we analyzed by immunofluorescence labelled-bacteria and transmission electronic microscopy the importance of the bacterial interaction with epithelial an immune cells associated to the gut, and the effect of feeding of b. animalis in the immune response. it was able to adhere and interact with both small and large intestine. in spite of this interaction with the gut, no modifications in the immune state (secretory or systemic response) were observed. a heterologous strain of bifidobacterium adolescentis from human faeces, was neither incapable of binding to the intestine, nor influence the immune system activation, when it  was administered during 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days; we believe that using a homologous strain, oral tolerance is developed even when the microorganism interacts with the immune cells associated with the intestine. however, we cannot ignore the beneficial effect of these microorganisms, especially in the prevention of intestinal infections. we think that this property exerted by bifidobacteria is more related to other mechanisms such as competitive inhibition, acid production or others, than enhancement of the immune state.

TI  == molecular microbial analysis of bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra).
AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

TI  == adhesion of bifidobacterium spp. to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == twenty-four bifidobacterium strains were examined for their ability to bind to immobilized human and bovine intestinal mucus glycoproteins. each of the tested bacteria exhibited its characteristic adhesion to human and bovine fecal mucus. no significant differences were found among the taxonomic species. among the tested bacteria, b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis, b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum adhered to human fecal mucus better than bovine fecal mucus, while the binding of b. animalis and  b. lactis was not preferential. these results suggest that the mucosal adhesive properties of bifidobacteria may be a strain dependent feature, and the mucosal binding of the human bifidobacteria may be more host specific.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == characterization of bifidobacteria by random dna amplification.
AB  == rapd conditions were optimized to generate reproducible banding patterns by testing primers, thermocyclers and overall reproducibility in repeat dna analysis and separate dna extractions. five primers were chosen on the basis of band intensity and distribution (between 2 and 10 bands) which clearly distinguished among strains of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum. the use of five single-primer reactions under optimized conditions improved the resolution and accuracy of the rapd method for  the characterization of dairy-related bifidobacteria. the results indicated that  this method was highly reproducible in repeated analysis. similarity between bifidobacteria strains was evaluated based on their rapd profiles. using a set of five primers, it was demonstrated that it may be possible to distinguish three different species of bifidobacterium (b. breve, b. bifidum and b. adolescentis),  based on similarity of the rapd profiles to known reference strains. furthermore, application of the rapd technique may also be useful and faster, than traditional systematics for placement of industrial strains into specific clusters (either b. longum/infantis or b. animalis/lactis).

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == selection of species-specific dna probes which detect strain restriction polymorphism in four bifidobacterium species.
AB  == randomly cloned fragments (in a size range 1 to 2.5 kb) of dna from bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, b. adolescentis cip 64.59t, b. bifidum cip 64.65 and b. animalis atcc 25527 were used as hybridization probes to characterize strains of these species and distinguish them from closely related bifidobacterium species. the fragments were screened for hybridization with native dna from 41 different bifidobacterium strains. for each species, a fragment hybridizing specifically with dna from strains of the same species was isolated. each fragment was then hybridized with restriction digests in order to  study the genome polymorphism. in some of the tested b. longum strains including  strain atcc 15707, the species-specific fragment l6/45 hybridized with 2 fragments instead of one as expected. sequence of the fragment revealed the presence of an orf which had an amino acid sequence similar to the site-specific  recombinases of lambda integrase family. moreover, southern analysis demonstrated that at least 3 copies of this fragment are present in the chromosome of b. longum atcc 15707 and in some other b. longum strains. the species-specific fragment a6/17 of b. adolescentis hybridized with the same restriction fragment on the eight strains of this species tested. the b. bifidum-specific fragment hybridized with different dna restriction fragments according to the strain. the  restriction fragment an1 from b. animalis atcc 25527 hybridized with the same restriction fragment from strain b. animalis atcc 27536. however, these two strains could be differentiated by another restriction pattern. thus, hybridization results highlight the genetic polymorphism which exists among bifidobacterium strains of the same species.

TI  == phenotypic differentiation of bifidobacteria of human and animal origins.
AB  == the phenotypes of 153 strains belonging or related to the genus bifidobacterium were studied. these organisms included 38 collection strains and 115 wild strains (41 strains of human origin, 56 strains of animal origin, and 18 strains obtained from rivers or sewage). our phenotypic analysis revealed seven main groups that were subdivided into 20 subgroups. seven subgroups contained no type or collection strain. among the human strains, the type strains of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and b. catenulatum fell into group i, which contained the type  strains of b. adolescentis (subgroup ib), b. dentium (subgroup ic), and b. angulatum (ungrouped). the type strain of b. breve belonged to subgroup iiia1, and the type strains of b. infantis and b. longum fell into subgroup iiib1. group vii comprised only wild strains that were isolated from human infant feces. among the animal strains, group ii consisted mainly of bifidobacteria that were isolated from pig feces and contained the type strains of b. suis (subgroup iib), b. thermophilum (subgroup iif), b. choerinum, and b. boum (ungrouped). wild strains belonging to group v were isolated from pig, calf, cow, and chicken feces; this included the type strains of b. animalis (subgroup va), b. magnum (subgroup vb), b. pseudolongum, and b. globosum (subgroup vc). the strains of human origin (groups i, iii, and vii) were well separated from the animal strains (groups ii, iv, and v). it was not surprising that the wild strains isolated from surface water or sewage were distributed in the animal groups as well as the human groups. thus, bifidobacteria can be considered to be successful indicators  of human or animal fecal pollution when they are correctly classified. the acidification patterns were not adequate to differentiate bifidobacterium species, as determined previously by mitsuoka (bifidobacteria microflora 3:11-28, 1984) and scardovi (p. 1418-1434, in p. h. a. sneath, n. s. mair, m. e. sharpe, and j. g. holt, ed., bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology, vol. 2, 1986). however, enzymatic tests furnished new taxonomic criteria for the genus.
