evidence that porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis fimbriae function in adhesion to actinomyces viscosus.
porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis adheres to gram-positive bacteria, such as actinomyces viscosus, when colonizing the tooth surface.
however, little is known of the adhesins responsible for this interaction.
a series of experiments were performed to determine whether p. gingivalis fimbriae function in its coadhesion with a. viscosus.
fimbriae typical of p. gingivalis were isolated from strain 2561 (atcc 33277) by the method of yoshimura et al.
(f. yoshimura, k. takahashi, y. nodasaka, and t. suzuki, j. bacteriol.
160:949-957, 1984) in fractions enriched with a 40-kda subunit, the fimbrillin monomer, p. gingivalis-a. viscosus coaggregation was inhibited by purified rabbit antifimbrial immunoglobulin g (igg) at dilutions eightfold higher than those of preimmune igg, providing indirect evidence implicating p. gingivalis fimbriae in coadhesion.
three types of direct binding assays further supported this observation.
(i) mixtures of isolated p. gingivalis fimbriae and a. viscosus wvu627 cells were incubated for 1 h, washed vigorously with phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2), and subjected to electrophoresis.
transblots onto nitrocellulose were probed with antifimbrial antiserum.
fimbrillin labeled positively on these blots.
no reaction occurred with the control protein, porcine serum albumin, when blots were exposed to anti-porcine serum albumin, (ii) a. viscosus cells incubated with p. gingivalis fimbriae were agglutinated only after the addition of antifimbrial antibodies.
(iii) binding curves generated from an enzyme immunoassay demonstrated concentration-dependent binding of p. gingivalis fimbriae to a. viscosus cells. from these lines of evidence, p. gingivalis fimbriae appear to be capable of binding to a. viscosus and mediating the coadhesion of these species.
