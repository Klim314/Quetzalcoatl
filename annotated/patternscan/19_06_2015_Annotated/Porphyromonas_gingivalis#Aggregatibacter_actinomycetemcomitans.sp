TI  == periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence in origins: the oral infections,  glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance study.
AB  == periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus are known to be associated. the relationship between periodontal microbiota and early diabetes risk has not been  studied. we investigated the association between periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults. origins (the oral infections,  glucose intolerance and insulin resistance study) cross sectionally enrolled 300  diabetes-free adults aged 20 to 55 y (mean +/- sd, 34 +/- 10 y; 77% female). prediabetes was defined as follows: 1) hemoglobin a1c values ranging from 5.7% to 6.4% or 2) fasting plasma glucose ranging from 100 to 125 mg/dl. in 1,188 subgingival plaque samples, 11 bacterial species were assessed at baseline, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and actinomyces naeslundii. full-mouth clinical periodontal examinations were performed, and participants were defined as having no/mild periodontitis vs. moderate/severe periodontitis per the definition of the centers for disease control and prevention / american academy of periodontology. modified poisson regression evaluated prediabetes prevalence across bacterial tertiles. prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for third vs. first tertiles are presented. all analyses were adjusted for cardiometabolic risk factors. all results presented currently arise from the baseline cross section. prediabetes prevalence was 18%, and 58% of participants had moderate/severe periodontitis. prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) summarizing associations between bacterial levels and prediabetes were as follows: a. actinomycetemcomitans, 2.48 (1.34, 4.58), p = 0.004; p. gingivalis, 3.41 (1.78, 6.58), p = 0.0003; t. denticola, 1.99 (0.992, 4.00), p = 0.052; t. forsythia, 1.95 (1.0, 3.84), p = 0.05; a. naeslundii, 0.46 (0.25, 0.85), p = 0.01. the prevalence ratio for prediabetes among participants with moderate/severe vs. no/mild periodontitis was 1.47 (0.78, 2.74), p = 0.23. higher colonization levels of specific periodontal microbiota are associated with higher prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults.

TI  == kinetic-dependent killing of oral pathogens with nitric oxide.
AB  == nitric oxide (no)-releasing silica nanoparticles were synthesized via the co-condensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate with aminosilanes and subsequent conversion of secondary amines to n-diazeniumdiolate no donors. a series of ~150  nm no-releasing particles with different no totals and release kinetics (i.e., half-lives) were achieved by altering both the identity and mol% composition of the aminosilane precursors. independent of identical 2 h no-release totals, enhanced antibacterial action was observed against the periodontopathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis with extended  no-release kinetics at ph 7.4. negligible bactericidal effect was observed against cariogenic streptococcus mutans at ph 7.4, even when using no-releasing silica particles with greater no-release totals. however, antibacterial activity  was observed against s. mutans at lower ph (6.4). this result was attributed to more rapid proton-initiated decomposition of the n-diazeniumdiolate no donors and greater no-release payloads. the data suggest a differential sensitivity to no between cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria with implications for the future development of no-releasing oral care therapeutics.

TI  == evaluation of a hydrophobic gel adhering to the gingiva in comparison with a standard water-soluble 1% chlorhexidine gel after scaling and root planing in patients with moderate chronic periodontitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic activity of a hydrophobic chlorhexidine-based gingiva-adhering gel containing herbal ingredients, compared with a commercially available 1% chlorhexidine water-soluble gel, during non-surgical therapy of moderate chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 34 subjects participated in this 6-month blinded randomized parallel controlled trial (isrctn35210084). after scaling and root planing (srp), test group received the gel, by rubbing on the gingiva, once every second day, for 14 days. the control group received the control gel twice daily. clinical parameters considered were the approximal plaque index, simplified oral hygiene index, modified gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level (primary outcome), assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months, together with the frequency of detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola (t.d.), tannerella forsythia (t.f.), and activity of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase (secondary outcomes). results: at 3 and 6 months, all clinical parameters improved significantly, without significant intergroup differences, except ohi-s, which improved at 3 months (p < 0.05). microbiological data resulted in no significant intergroup differences at baseline and 6 months. at 3 months, significant differences for p.g., t.f. and t.d. were noted. a significant reduction of neutrophil elastase after 3 and 6 months was observed (p < 0.005), without significant intergroup differences. for  myeloperoxidase, significant reductions were noted in both groups (p < 0.005 and  p < 0.05), but no significant intergroup differences. the tested product seemed to have an increased efficacy, due to longer persistence on the gingiva, with reduced application frequency. conclusions: both products had a relatively similar influence on the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic outcomes at 3 and 6 months after srp.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of citrus sinensis peel extracts against periodontopathic bacteria: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: use of plant extracts and phytochemicals with known antimicrobial properties may have great significance in therapeutic treatments. objective: to assess the in vitro antimicrobial potential and also determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of citrus sinensis peel extracts with a view of searching a novel extract as a remedy for periodontal pathogens. materials and methods: aqueous and ethanol (cold and hot) extracts prepared from peel of citrus sinensis were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity against aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, using agar well diffusion method. the lowest concentration of every extract considered as the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were determined for both test organisms. confidence level and level of significance were set at 95% and 5% respectively. results: prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis were resistant to aqueous extracts while aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited at very high cncentrations. hot ethanolic extracts showed significantly higher zone of inhibition than cold ethanolic extract. minimum inhibitory concentration of hot and cold ethanolic extracts of citrus sinensis peel ranged between 12-15 mg/ml against all three periodontal pathogens. conclusions: both extracts were found sensitive and contain compounds  with therapeutic potential. nevertheless, clinical trials on the effect of these  plants are essential before advocating large-scale therapy. key words: agar well  diffusion, antimicrobial activity, periodontal disease, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == interleukin-6 and microrna profiles induced by oral bacteria in human atheroma derived and healthy smooth muscle cells.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with possible contributions from bacterial antigens. we aimed to investigate the role of oral bacteria as inducers of inflammatory cascades in smooth muscle cells from carotid endarterectomy patients (athsmcs) and healthy controls (hsmcs). findings: inactivated streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gorgonii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used to stimulate inflammation in hsmcs and athsmcs. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha) was used as a positive control in all stimulations. interleukin-6 (il-6) levels were  determined from cell culture supernatants and microrna expression profiles from cells after 24 h of bacterial stimulation. genome wide expression (gwe) analyses  were performed after 5 h stimulation. all studied bacteria induced pro inflammatory il-6 production in both smcs. the most powerful inducer of il-6 was  a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.001). of the 84 studied mirnas, expression of 9 mirnas differed significantly (p </= 0.001) between hsmcs and athsmcs stimulated  with inactivated bacteria or tnfalpha. the data was divided into two groups: high il-6 producers (a. actinomytectemcomititans and tnfalpha) and low il-6 producers  (streptococcal strains and p. gingivalis). the expression of 4 mirnas (mir-181-5p, -186-5p, -28-5p and -155-5p) differed statistically significantly (p < 0.001) between healthy hsmcs and athsmcs in the low il-6 producer group. according to multidimensional scaling, two gene expression clusters were seen: one in hsmcs and one athsmcs. conclusions: our results suggest that inactivated oral bacteria induce inflammation that is differently regulated in healthy and atherosclerotic smcs.

TI  == periodontitis associated with plasminogen deficiency: a case report.
AB  == background: plasminogen deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is associated with aggressive periodontitis and gingival enlargement. previously  described treatments of plasminogen deficiency associated periodontitis have shown limited success. this is the first case report indicating a successful therapy approach consisting of a non-surgical supra- and subgingival debridement  in combination with an adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal regimen over an observation period of 4 years. case presentation: the intraoral examination of a 17-year-old turkish female with severe plasminogen deficiency revealed generalized increased pocket probing depths ranging from 6 to 9 mm, bleeding on probing over 30%, generalized tooth mobility, and gingival hyperplasia. alveolar bone loss ranged from 30% to 50%. clinical attachment loss corresponded to pocket probing depths. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and eikenella corrodens have been detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction. periodontal treatment consisted of full mouth disinfection and adjunctive systemic administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tid) and metronidazole (400 mg tid). a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen every three month in terms of supra- and subgingival debridement was rendered. the reported therapy has significantly improved periodontal health and arrested disease progression. intraoral examination at the end of the observation period 3.5 years after non-surgical periodontal therapy showed generalized decreased pocket probing depths ranging from 1 to 6 mm, bleeding on probing lower 30%, and  tooth mobility class i and ii. furthermore, microbiological analysis shows the absence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola after therapy. conclusion: adjunctive antibiotic treatment may alter the oral microbiome and thus, the inflammatory response of periodontal disease associated to plasminogen deficiency and diminishes the risk of pseudomembrane formation and progressive attachment loss. this case report indicates that patients with plasminogen deficiency may benefit from non-surgical periodontal treatment in combination with an adjunctive antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen.

TI  == quantitation of biofilm and planktonic life forms of coexisting periodontal species.
AB  == background: complexity of oral polymicrobial communities has prompted a need for  developing in vitro models to study behavior of coexisting bacteria. little knowledge is available of in vitro co-growth of several periodontitis-associated  species without early colonizers of dental plaque. the aim: was to determine temporal changes in the quantities of six periodontal species in an in vitro biofilm model in comparison with parallel planktonic cultures. material and methods: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus and fusobacterium nucleatum were anaerobically grown as multispecies and monospecies biofilms and parallel planktonic cultures using cell culture plates and microfuge tubes, respectively. after incubating 2, 4, 6, 8 days, biofilms and planktonic cultures  were harvested, dna extracted and the target species quantified using qpcr with species-specific 16s rdna primers. biofilm growth as monocultures was visualized  at day 2 and 8 with confocal microscopy and crystal violet staining. results: the six species were found throughout the test period in all culture conditions, except that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were not detected in multispecies planktonic cultures at day 8. in multispecies biofilm, p. gingivalis qpcr counts  (cells/ml) increased (p<0.05) from day 2-8 and were then higher (p<0.05) than those of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, whereas in monospecies biofilm,  p. gingivalis counts were lower (p<0.05) than those of the other species, except  a. actinomycetemcomitans. when multi- and monospecies biofilm cultures were compared, p. gingivalis counts were higher (p<0.05) but those of the other species, except p. intermedia, lower (p<0.05) in multispecies biofilm. comparison between planktonic and biofilm cultures showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  micra and c. rectus had higher (p<0.05) counts in planktonic cultures no matter whether grown in mono- or multispecies environment. conclusions: six periodontal  species were able to form multispecies biofilm up to 8 days in vitro without pioneer plaque bacteria. p. gingivalis seemed to prefer multispecies biofilm environment whereas p. micra and a. actinomycetemcomitans planktonic culture.

TI  == full mouth periodontal debridement with or without adjunctive metronidazole gel in smoking patients with chronic periodontitis: a pilot study.
AB  == background and objective: the evidence of effectiveness of metronidazole (mtz) as an adjunct therapy to periodontal procedure in the treatment of patients with chronic periodontitis is not conclusive. the aim of this study was to compare the effect of mtz (delivered locally as a gel or systemically as a tablet) as an adjunctive therapy with full mouth periodontal debridement (1 h of ultrasonic calculus/plaque removal) in smokers with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: this pilot study involved 30 smokers with at least six teeth with a clinical attachment loss of >/= 5 mm and probing pocket depth (ppd) of >/= 5 mm.  they were randomly assigned into one of three groups (n = 10): (i) 3 g daily of placebo gel applied topically (using a dental tray with the gel overnight) + periodontal debridement; (ii) 3 g daily of a 15% mtz benzoate gel applied topically (using a dental tray with the gel overnight) + periodontal debridement; and (iii) a daily single dose of 750 mg mtz (flagyl(r) ) + periodontal debridement. clinical parameters (visible plaque index, gingival bleeding index [gbi], relative attachment level and ppd) and quantitative analysis (by real-time polymerase chain reaction) of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia were assessed at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 mo after periodontal debridement. results: there was no statistically significant difference in the average gbi and visible plaque index  values at baseline between the groups (p >/= 0.05). there was no significant difference between groups in all parameters evaluated (p >/= 0.05). significant reductions in gbi at 3 and 6 mo were observed in all groups (p < 0.05). significant reductions in both ppd and relative attachment level at 1, 3 and 6 mo were observed in all groups (p < 0.05). significant reductions in bacterial levels at 7 and 30 d were observed in all groups (p < 0.05). conclusion: adjunctive use of mtz (gel or tablet) to periodontal debridement had similar clinical and microbiological improvement compared to treatment with placebo + periodontal debridement in smokers with chronic periodontitis up to 6 mo post-treatment. further studies are necessary to confirm the clinical relevance of these findings.

TI  == bacterial profile of aggressive periodontitis in morocco: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: aggressive periodontitis (agp) is one of the most severe forms of periodontal diseases. in morocco, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has been  strongly associated with agp, however limited knowledge is available about the implication of other periodontal pathogens in this entity. therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota in moroccan patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 50 aggressive, 13 localized and 37 generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 20 chronic periodontitis (chp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were  pooled in pre-reduced transport fluid and examined by culture. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more frequent (p = 0.004) in generalised  agp compared to chp, and porphyromonas gingivalis was less prevalent in localized agp, when compared with generalized agp (p = 0.040) or chp (p = 0.016). prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia were also frequently detected in all groups. mean proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in agp groups, when compared to chp, and generalized agp patients harbored significantly higher proportions of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, when compared to localized agp or chp. conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum were frequently detected in this moroccan population with agp. differences in frequency of detection, counts and proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. forsythia suggests the presence of distinct microbiological profiles for localized agp, generalized agp and chp patients.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == periodontal therapy effects on nitrite related to oral bacteria: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. this 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. methods: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-qs) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-fms) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (chx) (qs+chx and fms+chx), placebo (qs+placebo and fms+placebo), or no mouth rinse (qs+none and fms+none) use. real-time pcr determined total bacterial, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundi levels. salivary nitrite concentration was determined with griess reagent. data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by anova (analysis of variance), kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney, and spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). results: nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. regarding chx use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (fms+chx) and one positive correlation between p.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (qs+chx). independently of rinse type, in the fms group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. conclusions: the relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term chx use.

TI  == a. actinomycetemcomitans profile and red complex bacterial species of an afro-brazilian community: a comparative study.
AB  == purposes: the primary aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare the levels of red complex bacteria between afro-brazilian and non afro-brazilian cohort. the secondary aim was to compare the distribution of both aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype b and its jp2 strains among participants who harboured this bacterial species. methods: a total of 84 individuals were included in this study: 42 afro-descendants (mean age 35.9 +/- 13.1 years) and 42 non-afro-descendants (mean age 36.2 +/- 13.1 years) matched (1:1) by periodontal  diagnosis, age and gender. all participants received clinical examinations of periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and plaque and gingival indices. subgingival samples were taken for microbial analysis. first, genomic dna (gdna) was extracted and purified and the quantification of total number of bacterial cells, a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola was carried out by qpcr. then, a. actinomycetemcomitans strains were classified according to serotype b and jp2 profiles by conventional pcr. results: clinically, mean pd, mean cal and percentage of cal >/= 3 mm differed between groups (student's t-test p<0.05). the levels of red complex bacteria between afro-brazilian and non-afro-brazilian populations were similar. the exception was verified to a. actinomycetemcomitans  showing significantly higher levels among afro-brazilian descendants in comparison to non-afro-brazilian descendants. afro-brazilian descendants were clearly infected by more virulent serotype b and jp2 strains. conclusions: despite no statistically significant differences related to the red complex species, afro-brazilian descendants harboured higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, our findings confirm that afro-descendant populations are preferably colonised by a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b as well as jp2 strains.

TI  == quantitative proteomics reveal distinct protein regulations caused by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans within subgingival biofilms.
AB  == periodontitis is an infectious disease that causes the inflammatory destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues, caused by polymicrobial biofilm communities growing on the tooth surface. aggressive periodontitis is strongly associated with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival biofilms. nevertheless, whether and how a. actinomycetemcomitans orchestrates molecular changes within the biofilm is unclear. the aim of this work was to decipher the interactions between a. actinomycetemcomitans and other  bacterial species in a multi-species biofilm using proteomic analysis. an in vitro 10-species "subgingival" biofilm model, or its derivative that included additionally a. actinomycetemcomitans, were anaerobically cultivated on hydroxyapatite discs for 64 h. when present, a. actinomycetemcomitans formed dense intra-species clumps within the biofilm mass, and did not affect the numbers of the other species in the biofilm. liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteomic content of the biofilm lysate. a  total of 3225 and 3352 proteins were identified in the biofilm, in presence or absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, respectively. label-free quantitative proteomics revealed that 483 out of the 728 quantified bacterial proteins (excluding those of a. actinomycetemcomitans) were accordingly regulated. interestingly, all quantified proteins from prevotella intermedia were up-regulated, and most quantified proteins from campylobacter rectus, streptococcus anginosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were down-regulated in presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. enrichment of gene ontology pathway analysis showed that the regulated groups of proteins were responsible primarily  for changes in the metabolic rate, the ferric iron-binding, and the 5s rna binding capacities, on the universal biofilm level. while the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans did not affect the numeric composition or absolute protein  numbers of the other biofilm species, it caused qualitative changes in their overall protein expression profile. these molecular shifts within the biofilm warrant further investigation on their potential impact on its virulence properties, and association with periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == antibacterial photodynamic treatment of periodontopathogenic bacteria with indocyanine green and near-infrared laser light enhanced by trolox(tm).
AB  == background and objectives: it has been shown that certain vitamins can significantly enhance the effect of photodynamic anti-tumor therapy. unfortunately, there is no sufficient information available about the impact of those antioxidants on antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt). the present study is aimed at investigating the antimicrobial effect of the dye indocyanine green (icg) in the presence of trolox(tm) , a vitamin e analogue, upon irradiation with near-infrared (nir) laser light (808 nm) on the gramnegative periodontopathogenic bacteria aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.). methods: bacteria solved in pbs were incubated with icg (50-500 mug/ml) in the presence and absence of trolox(tm) (2 mm). irradiation was performed after 10 minutes of dark-incubation with nir-laser-light (25-100 j/cm(2) , 810 nm). during treatment, temperature was also recorded inside the bacterial solutions. the treated suspensions were serial diluted and plated onto blood agar plates. after anaerobe cultivation for 5 days the colony-forming units (cfu/ml) were determined. results: the antibacterial effect was icg-concentration and exposure dependent. it was found that high icg-concentrations and light fluence rates caused bacterial reduction due to hyperthermia. where low icg-concentrations (<250 mug/ml) and fluence rates only induced minor regression, additional trolox(tm) -administration significantly enhanced the photodynamic effect. while treatment of a.a. (250 mug/ml icg, 100 j/cm(2) ) without trolox(tm) caused no bacterial reduction, additional administration led to total eradication. in the presence of trolox(tm) reduction to one-fifth of the original icg-concentration (50 mug/ml) still induced total suppression of p.g. and f.n. at identical fluence (100 j/cm(2) ). treatment with icg, nir-light or trolox(tm) alone showed no remarkable bactericidal effect. application of high icg-concentrations (500 mug/ml) and exposure values (100 j/cm(2) ) caused peak temperatures of 64.53 degrees c. conclusions: the results clearly show that trolox(tm) significantly enhanced the  antibacterial effect of icg upon irradiation with nir-laser-light. additional administration of trolox(tm) may also increase the efficiency of other apdt systems.

TI  == comparison of serum amyloid a protein and c-reactive protein levels as inflammatory markers in periodontitis.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to compare serum amyloid a (saa) protein levels with high-sensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp) levels as markers of systemic inflammation in patients with chronic periodontitis. the association of  serum titers of antibodies to periodontal microbiota and saa/hs-crp levels in periodontitis patients was also studied. methods: a total of 110 individuals were included in this study. patients were assessed for levels of hs-crp and saa. nonfasting blood samples were collected from participants at the time of clinical examination. the diagnosis of adipose tissue disorders was made according to previously defined criteria. to determine saa levels, a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized. paper points were transferred to a sterile tube to obtain a pool of samples for polymerase chain reaction processing and the identification of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and tannerella forsythia. the serum level of igg1 and igg2 antibodies to p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and t. forsythia was also  determined. results: saa and hs-crp levels were higher in periodontitis patients  than in controls (p<0.05). in bivariate analysis, high levels of hs-crp (>3 mg/l) and saa (>10 mg/l) were significantly associated with chronic periodontitis (p=0.004). the spearman correlation analysis between acute-phase proteins showed  that saa positively correlated with hs-crp (r=0.218, p=0.02). in the adjusted model, chronic periodontitis was associated with high levels of saa (odds ratio [or], 5.5; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.6-18.2; p=0.005) and elevated hs-crp levels (or, 6.1, 95% ci, 1.6-23.6; p=0.008). increased levels of serum igg2 antibodies to p. gingivalis were associated with high levels of saa (or, 3.6; 95% ci, 1.4-8.5; p=0.005) and high concentrations of hs-crp (or, 4.3; 95% ci, 1.9-9.8; p<0.001). conclusions: saa and hs-crp concentrations in patients with chronic periodontitis are comparably elevated. high serum titers of antibodies to p. gingivalis and the presence of periodontal disease are independently related to high saa and hs-crp levels.

TI  == inter- and intra-test agreement of three commercially available molecular diagnostic tests for the identification of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to compare the agreement and reproducibility  of three test kits (iai pado test 4[symbol: see text]5(r), micro-ident(r), and carpegen(r) perio diagnostik) regarding the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. materials and methods: periodontal plaque samples from 20  patients suffering from severe chronic or aggressive periodontitis were split into two identical batches. samples of batch 1 were evaluated immediately. samples of batch 2 were analyzed after a storage period of 2 weeks at 4 degrees c. results: the conformity of results obtained by the evaluated test kits as well as the concordant detection rate of periodontopathogens proved to be low. the agreement of the detection rate depends on the chosen test kit. the intra-test reproducibility of the qualitative analysis of identical plaque samples was perfect only for carpegen(r) perio diagnostik. the quantitative analysis of the results expressed as n-fold difference of the test results revealed an only poor  inter-test agreement between the test systems. conclusions: results of test kits  for the identification of periodontopathogens are significantly influenced by the detection technology applied. the most advanced technology tended to give the most reliable results. clinical relevance: as microbiological test results are supposed to be used for the planning of subsequent treatment strategies, clinicians should be aware of the limitations of results obtained by the different test systems and should use the results only in conjunction with clinical data for subsequent therapeutic decisions.

TI  == anaerobic culture to detect periodontal and caries pathogens.
AB  == background: anaerobic culture has been critical in our understanding of the oral  microbiotas. highlight: studies in advanced periodontitis in the 1970's revealed  microbial complexes that associated with different clinical presentations. taxonomy studies identified species newly-observed in periodontitis as aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter (wolinella) rectus and other campylobacter species, and tannerella (bacteroides) forsythia. anaerobic culture of initial periodontitis showed overlap in the microbiota with  gingivitis, and added selenomonas noxia and filifactor alocis as putative periodontal pathogens. porphyromonas gingivalis and t. forsythia were found to be associated with initial periodontitis in adults. the dominant microbiota of dental caries differs from that of periodontitis. the major cariogenic species are acidogenic and acid tolerant species particularly streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species. anaerobic culture of severe early childhood caries revealed a widely diverse microbiota, comparable to that observed using cloning and sequencing. the pcr-based cloning approach, however, underestimated actinobacteria compared with culture. only a subset of the caries-associated microbiota was acid tolerant, with different segments of the microbiota cultured on blood agar compared to a low ph acid agar. while the major caries-associated species was s. mutans, a new species, scardovia wiggsiae, was significantly associated with early childhood caries. higher counts of s. wiggsiae were also observed in initial white spot carious lesions in adolescents. conclusion: in periodontitis and dental caries, anaerobic culture studies of advanced disease provided a comprehensive analysis of the microbiota of these infections. anaerobic culture highlighted the limitation of pcr with standard primers that underestimate detection of actinobacteria.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == recovery of putative periodontal pathogens from curette sampling at different depths of periodontal lesions: an in vivo cross-sectional clinical study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using pcr to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. the chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. a repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of  probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. results: the effect of  probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was  found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. the microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. conclusion: there is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.

TI  == short-term effect of removal of fixed orthodontic appliances on gingival health and subgingival microbiota: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to assess  and compare the microbiological and clinical parameters of patients wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance, as opposed to 10 days after the bracket had been removed following treatment. materials and methods. in total, 122 patients participated in this study; 61 of the subjects were assessed at baseline (wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance: t1) and 10 days after bracket removal (t2). the other 61 individuals had never worn an orthodontic appliance before and these subjects served as controls (ct). subgingival plaque samples were assessed for bleeding on probing (gbi) and plaque index (vpi). pcr of 16s rdna, followed by reverse species-specific hybridization for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were performed. a descriptive analysis was conducted; chi-squared, student's matched and unmatched t-tests, the point biserial correlation coefficient and the mcnemar test were used to test for differences between groups (p < 0.05). results. the gbi and vpi clinical parameters showed statistical differences (p < 0.05) between t1-t2, t1-ct and t2-ct. the prevalence of t. denticola had significantly decreased (p = 0.039) 10 days after appliance removal. at t2, a significant positive correlation was found between gbi and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.01) and between clinical parameters and p. intermedia. in patients without a fixed orthodontic appliance (t2 and ct), there  was a significant positive correlation between t. forsythia and vpi. conclusion.  local factors associated with the wearing of a fixed orthodontic appliance influence changes in subgingival plaque that leads to more inflammation and bleeding.

TI  == selected dietary (poly)phenols inhibit periodontal pathogen growth and biofilm formation.
AB  == periodontitis (pd) is a chronic infectious disease mediated by bacteria in the oral cavity. (poly)phenols (pps), ubiquitous in plant foods, possess antimicrobial activities and may be useful in the prevention and management of periodontitis. the objective of this study was to test the antibacterial effects  of selected pps on periodontal pathogens, on both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. selected pps (n = 48) were screened against streptococcus mitis (s. mitis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). the antibacterial potential of each compound was evaluated in terms  of planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (pmic) and planktonic minimum bactericidal concentration (pmbc) using standardized broth microdilution assays.  the most active pps were further tested for their effect on mono-species and multi-species biofilms using a colorimetric resazurin-based viability assay and scanning electron microscopy. of the 48 pps tested, 43 showed effective inhibition of planktonic growth of one or more test strains, of which curcumin was the most potent (pmic range = 7.8-62.5 mug ml(-1)), followed by pyrogallol (pmic range = 2.4-2500 mug ml(-1)), pyrocatechol (mic range = 4.9-312.5 mug ml(-1)) and quercetin (pmic range = 31.2-500 mug ml(-1)). at this concentration,  adhesion of curcumin and quercetin to the substrate also inhibited adhesion of s. mitis, and biofilm formation and maturation. while both curcumin and quercetin were able to alter architecture of mature multi-species biofilms, only curcumin-treated biofilms displayed a significantly reduced metabolic activity. overall, pps possess antibacterial activities against periodontopathic bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. further cellular and in vivo studies are necessary to confirm their beneficial activities and potential use in the prevention and or treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == microbial leakage at the implant/abutment connection due to implant insertion maneuvers: cross-sectional study 5 years post loading in healthy patients.
AB  == abstract the aim of this study was to test if stress on the prosthetic connection during insertion maneuvers can induce micro-warping at the implant-connection. from sept 2011 to july 20134, patients with implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were selected from all those that had received dental implant therapy in the past and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits during the study period. patients having implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were recruited. samples were obtained from inside the connection and the abutment surface (cias) using absorbent sterile paper tips. qrt-pcr was performed for total bacterial counts and loads of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), peptostreptococcus micros (pm), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), eikenella corrodens (ec), and candida albicans (ca). the anova test  was used to test for differences. nine patients (20 implants, mp group) and 5 patients (10 implants, me group) were included. regarding the red complex, tf was seen in 80% and 30% of mp and me implants respectively (p<0.001). significant differences were also found in microbial load. for td, proportions were 45% vs. 10% (p=0.022) with no significant differences at load levels. regarding the orange complex, higher prevalence values were found in mp implants, although differences were non-significant. microbial load levels for orange complex bacteria were higher for mp than me, being these differences statistically significant for fn (4.94 vs 3.09; p=0.001). finally, ec was only detected in the  mp group, and ca and aa were not found in either group. within its limitation (small sample size, retrospective analysis, indirect measurement method), the present study suggest that aa mounter not impacting on the prosthetic connection  should be used to reduce microbial contamination of implants.

TI  == the effect of il-4 gene polymorphisms on cytokine production in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy controls.
AB  == chronic periodontitis (cp) is an inflammatory disease of the teeth-supporting tissues in which genetic predisposition, dental plaque bacteria, and immune mechanisms all play important roles. the aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of il-4 gene polymorphisms in chronic periodontitis and to investigate the association between polymorphisms and cytokines production after bacterial stimulation. sixty-two subjects (47 cp patients and 15 healthy controls) with detected two polymorphisms in the il-4 gene (-590c/t and intron 3 vntr) were examined. production of cytokines (il-1alpha, il-1beta, il-4, il-5, il-6, il-10,  il-17, tnfalpha, infgamma, and vegf) was studied after in vitro stimulation of isolated peripheral blood by mitogens (pokeweed mitogen, concanavalin a), dental  plaque bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia), and heat shock protein (hsp) 70 by the luminex multiplex cytokine analysis system. the results were correlated with il-4 genotypes in patients with cp and healthy controls. the mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood of cp patients with selected il-4 polymorphisms significantly altered the production of ifngamma, il-10, il-1beta, il-1alpha, tnfalpha, and il-6 after stimulation by hsp 70 or selected bacteria (from p < 0.001 to p < 0.05). il-4 gene polymorphisms may influence the  function of mononuclear cells to produce not only interleukin-4 but also other cytokines, especially in patients with cp.

TI  == microbiological effects of periodontal therapy plus azithromycin in patients with diabetes: results from a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == current evidence suggests that periodontal infection may aggravate diabetes control. the aim of this study was to determine the changes in the frequency with which porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were detected in patients with diabetes with the use of non-surgical therapy plus azithromycin in a randomized clinical trial. one hundred and five (105) patients with diabetes and chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: subgingival mechanical therapy with azithromycin, subgingival mechanical therapy with placebo and supragingival prophylaxis with azithromycin. complete periodontal clinical examinations and detection of periodontal pathogens using polymerase chain reaction were carried out at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months after periodontal therapy. the frequency with which porphyromonas gingivalis, treponemadenticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were detected decreased at 3 months in  all groups. tannerella forsythia increased after3 months in all groups. all organisms had similar frequencies at 9 months in all groups. subgingival mechanical therapy with adjunctive azithromycin had no additional effect on the frequency with which the periodontal pathogens investigated were detected in patients with diabetes.

TI  == clinical, microbial, and immune responses observed in patients with diabetes after treatment for gingivitis: a three-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: although patients with diabetes are frequently affected by periodontitis, only a few investigations have focused on gingivitis in this at-risk population. this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial compared the response to a gingivitis treatment protocol that combined mechanical procedures and daily use of an essential oil (eo) mouthrinse between patients with and without diabetes. methods: the whole-mouth periodontal probing depth (pd), gingival index (gi), and plaque index (pi) were monitored in gingivitis cases among systemically healthy patients (n = 60) or those with diabetes (n = 60) at baseline and 3 months after treatment. levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and total bacterial  load were determined by a real-time polymerase chain reaction in intrasulci plaque samples. the volume of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) was quantified, and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) levels were determined in gcf samples. after a full-mouth ultrasonic debridement, patients were randomly assigned to an eo or a  placebo rinse for 90 days (40 ml/day). the data were analyzed through repeated-measures analysis of variance and multiple comparisons tukey tests (p <0.05). results: gi was more severe in the diabetes group. diabetes impaired gi and reduced gcf volume. pd, bacterial levels, and il-1beta improved similarly in  both systemic conditions. the adjunctive use of eo provided greater reductions of pi, gi, total bacterial load, t. forsythia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and gcf volume. conclusions: response to gingivitis treatment in patients with diabetes can slightly differ from that in patients without diabetes. daily use of an eo mouthrinse after ultrasonic debridement benefited patients with and without diabetes.

TI  == periodontal microbiology in latin america.
AB  == this review article describes the microbiota associated with periodontal disease  in latin america. this vast territory includes 22 nations, which show great ethnic diversity, with large groups of white people, black people, mestizo people and native people. widespread poverty and limited access to education and health-care services, including periodontal care, are prominent predisposing factors for destructive periodontal disease in latin america. black people and mestizo people seem to have particularly severe periodontal disease and are frequently colonized by the major periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis  and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the 'red complex' bacterial pathogens  and a. actinomycetemcomitans predominate in chronic and aggressive periodontitis, but gram-negative enteric rods and herpesviruses can also play important periodontopathic roles in latin america. the key to minimizing the risk of periodontal disease is control of the pathogens, and new low-cost periodontal treatments deserve serious consideration in latin america.

TI  == adjunctive moxifloxacin in the treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis  patients: clinical and microbiological results of a randomized, triple-blind and  placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  == aim: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of moxifloxacin (mox) in one-stage scaling and root planing (srp) in treating generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). materials  and methods: forty subjects were randomly allocated to two treatment groups. the  two treatment groups consisted of srp combined with systemically administered mox at the dosage of 400 mg once daily for 7 days or srp + placebo once daily for 7 days. subgingival plaque samples were analysed for cultivable bacteria. results:  both groups resulted in significant reduction of probing depth (pd) and clinical  attachment level (cal) compared with baseline (p < 0.0001), and this difference was maintained at 6 months from baseline in both groups. however, subjects receiving mox showed the greatest improvements cal, and pd. subjects in both groups at 6 months displayed the greatest reduction from baseline in frequency of sites with pd >/= 6 mm (p < 0.001), favouring the mox group. adjunctive antibiotic protocol reduced subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to  undetectable levels, after 3 and 6 months, and there was a significant reduction  in the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia in the mox group compared to the placebo group. conclusions: the results from this study suggest that moxifloxacin as and adjunct to one-stage full-mouth srp leads to a better clinical and microbiological advantages compared to mechanical treatment.

TI  == in-vitro activity of taurolidine on single species and a multispecies population  associated with periodontitis.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of taurolidine was compared with minocycline against microbial species associated with periodontitis (four single strains and a 12-species mixture). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), killing as well as activities on established  and forming single-species biofilms and a 12-species biofilm were determined. the mics of taurolidine against single species were always 0.31 mg/ml, the mbcs were  0.64 mg/ml. the used mixed microbiota was less sensitive to taurolidine, mic and  the mbc was 2.5 mg/ml. the strains and the mixture were completely killed by 2.5  mg/ml taurolidine, whereas 256 mug/ml minocycline reduced the bacterial counts of the mixture by 5 log10 colony forming units (cfu). coating the surface with 10 mg/ml taurolidine or 256 mug/ml minocycline prevented completely biofilm formation of porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 but not of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans y4 and the mixture. on 4.5 d old biofilms, taurolidine acted concentration dependent with a reduction by 5 log10 cfu (p. gingivalis atcc 33277) and 7 log10 cfu (a. actinomycetemcomitans y4) when applying 10 mg/ml. minocycline decreased the cfu counts by 1-2 log10 cfu independent of the used concentration. the reduction of the cfu counts in the 4.5 d old multi-species biofilms was about 3 log10 cfu after application of any minocycline concentration and after using 10 mg/ml taurolidine. taurolidine is active against species associated with periodontitis, even within biofilms. nevertheless a complete elimination of complex biofilms by taurolidine seems to be impossible and underlines the importance of a mechanical removal of biofilms prior to application of taurolidine.

TI  == regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: in periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (am) and nitric oxide (no). the aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. material and methods: regulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, veillonella atypica, streptococcus salivarius and candida  albicans was examined. am and no were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (no metabolites) griess assay respectively. cellular production of am and inducible no synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. the inter-relationship of am and no production were further investigated with macrophages. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus induced maximal levels of both am and no after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral  keratinocytes. am production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the no donor s-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible no synthase inhibitor, nomega -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. likewise, no production was increased upon exposure to am, while the am receptor antagonist am 22-52 reduced the release of no. conclusions: pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, p. gingivalis and prev. intermedia, and commensals, s. salivarius and v. atypica, as regards the upregulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes. interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. understanding the coordinated regulation of am and no production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == periodontal and peri-implant microbiota in patients with healthy and inflamed periodontal and peri-implant tissues.
AB  == objective: to compare the prevalence and levels of six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty-two chinese were included. four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [ppd >/= 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (bop) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (ppd >/=4 mm). subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr) was used to quantify six pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), treponema denticola (t.d.), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), and staphylococcus aureus (s.a.). counts were log10-transformed. results: the most commonly detected species were s. a. and f.  n., while a. a. and. p. i. had the lowest detection frequency. the detection frequencies of diseased tooth or implant sites for each of the six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. there were no statistically significant differences  for any of the species or clinical sites (p > 0.05, cochran's q test). no statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of f. nucleatum. this was more abundant in periodontitis sites (p = 0.023, friedman's 2-way anova). both periodontal and  peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor  s. aureus cells. the log10-transformed loads of s. aureus were approximately 3.5  within each of the clinical sites (p = 0.232). this was the highest of the six species analyzed. conclusions: within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of  health status. the prevalence and levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis. a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with both disease conditions, periodontitis  and peri-implantitis, but not with either gingival or mucosal health.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of pineapple extract (bromelain) on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease resulting in the destruction of periodontal tissues. various treatment modalities have been tried in the form  of mechanical therapy and surgical therapy. antimicrobial agents have been used as a monotherapy and as an adjunct with mechanical debridement. various plant extracts have been used as antibacterial agents. pineapple extract (bromelian) is one such agent. hence this study was conducted to assess the antibacterial efficacy of bromelain on both aerobic and anaerobic periodontal microorganisms. the aim was to assess the antibacterial efficacy of bromelain on both aerobic and anaerobic periodontal microorganisms. materials and methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of bromelain was tested on isolated strains of streptococcus  mutans, enterococcus fecalis aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) using serial dilution broth method. results: s. mutans showed sensitivity at the lowest concentration of 2 mg/ml as compared to e fecalis (31.25 mg/ml) while pgingivalis showed sensitivity at the lowest concentration of 4.15 mg/ml as compared to aa (16.6 mg/ml). conclusion: bromelain exerts an antibacterial effect against potent periodontal pathogens; hence, it may be used as an antibacterial agent. however, further trial has to be conducted to validate this result.

TI  == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples of italian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 italian patients with chronic periodontitis. possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. at first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (meridol(r) perio diagnostics, gaba international, switzerland). porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were investigated.  fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. bacterial load of pg, td, tf and fn showed a direct correlation to bleeding on probing (bop) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). the bacterial load was always directly correlated to probing pocket depth (ppd) (p=0.0001). among the investigated variables, ppd resulted the most important risk indicator  for periodontal pathogens. bop appeared as a risk indicator for td, tf, pg detection. few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the italian population. considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.

TI  == opposite effect of supernatants from selected periopathogens and oral lactobacilli cultures on atp levels in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == studies were performed on the effects of supernatants obtained from bacterial cultures, including cultures of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and lactobacillus acidophilus strains on atp levels in human gingival fibroblasts (hgf-1) and on their viability. atp levels were evaluated using luminescence test and cell viability was estimated using a fluorescence test. in control cultures mean levels of atp in hgf-1 amounted to 4.90+/-0.32 mln rlu. supernatants of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans cultures were found to significantly reduce atp production  in hgf-1 (mean levels of atp amounted to 3.41+/-0.33 and 3.55+/-0.3 mln rlu respectively), which was not accompanied by an increased proportion of dead fibroblasts. supernatants of p. intermedia induced no significant alterations in  atp level in hgf-1. in turn, supernatants of l. acidophilus h2o2 (+) and h2o2 (-) cultures significantly increased atp levels in hgf-1 (the mean levels amounted to 5.94+/-0.31 mln rlu and 5.88+/-0.28 mln rlu respectively). the results indicate that extracellular products of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans most probably represent mitochondria-targeted peptides, which reduce synthesis of atp  in hgf-1. in turn, extracellular products of l. acidophilus seem to represent exopolysaccharides (eps) with pro-oxidant activity, which stimulate synthesis of  atp in hgf-1.

TI  == essential oils and isolated compounds from lippia alba leaves and flowers: antimicrobial activity and osteoclast apoptosis.
AB  == in the present study, essential oils extracted from the leaves and flowers of lippia alba (mill.) n.e.br. (l. alba) were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity and their effects on osteoclasts. the periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans; atcc 43717), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum; atcc 25586) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis); atcc 33277) were used in antimicrobial activity assays for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), whereas bacteroides fragilis (b. fragilis; atcc 25285) was used as the control microorganism. osteoclast (oc) apoptosis was assessed by tunel assay and fas receptor expression was detected by immunocytochemistry. the analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that p. gingivalis had the lowest mic values, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans had the highest. l. alba essential oils were found to be toxic to human cells, although the compounds, carvone, limonene and citral, were non-toxic and induced apoptosis in the ocs. this study demonstrates that l. alba has potential biotechnological application in dentistry. in fact periodontal disease has a multifactorial etiology, and the immune response to microbial challenge leads to osteoclast activation and the resorption of the alveolar bone, resulting in tooth loss.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma and other plasma preparations against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: in addition to releasing a pool of growth factors during activation,  platelets have many features that indicate their role in the anti-infective host  defense. the antimicrobial activities of platelet-rich plasma (prp) and related plasma preparations against periodontal disease-associated bacteria were evaluated. methods: four distinct plasma fractions were extracted in the formulation used commonly in dentistry and were tested for their antibacterial properties against three periodontal bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the minimum inhibitory concentration of each plasma preparation was determined, and in vitro  time-kill assays were used to detect their abilities to inhibit bacterial growth. bacterial adhesion interference and the susceptibility of bacterial adherence by  these plasma preparations were also conducted. results: all plasma preparations can inhibit bacterial growth, with prp showing the superior activity. bacterial growth inhibition by prp occurred in the first 24 hours after application in the  time-kill assay. prp interfered with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans attachment and enhanced exfoliation of attached p. gingivalis but had no influences on f. nucleatum bacterial adherence. conclusions: prp expressed antibacterial properties, which may be attributed to platelets possessing additional antimicrobial molecules. the application of prp on periodontal surgical sites is advisable because of its regenerative potential and its antibacterial effects.

TI  == effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on short chain fatty acid levels in  gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: short chain fatty acids (scfas) play important roles in periodontal diseases. however, the concentrations of scfas in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with aggressive periodontitis are not known. the aim of this intervention study was to investigate the influences of non-surgical periodontal  therapy on levels of scfas in the gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (g-agp), and analyze the concentrations of scfas in sites with or without the detected putative periodontal pathogens. material and methods: eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected on filter paper strips from patients with g-agp (n = 20; mean age  24.5 years), before and at 2 wk, 2, 4 and 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal treatment. eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected from periodontally healthy controls (n = 20; mean age 26.2 years). concentrations of formic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and isovaleric acid from the supernatant of gingival crevicular fluid samples were measured by high performance capillary electrophoresis. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum from the precipitate of the same pretreatment samples of gingival crevicular fluids were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. results: the clinical parameters of patients with g-agp during the 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal  treatment were improved remarkably. the formic acid concentration increased significantly after treatment; the level of formic acid was lower in the p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with the negative sites. the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid reduced significantly after treatment and reached the lowest level at 2 wk post-treatment, although showed a tendency to increase after 2 mo post-treatment, and the three scfa levels were significantly higher in p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with those in the negative sites. conclusion: non-surgical periodontal treatment resulted in a significant decrease of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid levels and increase of formic acid level in gingival crevicular fluids in patients with g-agp, accompanied by improvement in clinical parameters. a marked lower level of formic acid, as well as higher levels of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with g-agp was consistent with periodontal pathogen infection.

TI  == effect of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus hd100 on multispecies oral communities.
AB  == the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on different periodontal pathogens has already been described. however, it is necessary to consider the polymicrobial nature of periodontal disease. the current study explores the predation of bdellovibrio on oral pathogens organized in multispecies communities. the effect of the predator was evaluated on in vitro six species communities with microbial culturing. additionally, the effect on ex vivo subgingival plaque and saliva samples from periodontitis patients was assessed. in the latter experiment results were examined with microbial culturing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the latter technique was used to get an overview of the whole mixed microbial population. results showed that even in more complex models, b. bacteriovorus was still able to predate on fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. however predation on prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis could not be validated in multispecies models. the effect of bdellovibrio was not restricted to the target bacteria. changes in the  overall ecology of the different models were evident. it could be concluded that  the efficiency of predation decreased when complexity of the models increased. however, b. bacteriovorus was able to attack two important oral pathogens, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, even when present in ex vivo clinical samples. these effects still have to be validated in in vivo models to see the impact of bdellovibrio on the whole bacterial ecology.

TI  == antibodies to periodontal pathogens are associated with coronary plaque remodeling but not with vulnerability or burden.
AB  == objective: previous studies have suggested positive associations between periodontal infection and cardiovascular disease. we aimed to investigate the associations of circulating antibodies against periodontal pathogens with 1-year  cardiovascular outcome, as well as the extent of coronary atherosclerosis, plaque vulnerability and lesion remodeling on intravascular ultrasound (ivus) imaging. methods: between 2008 and 2011, radiofrequency ivus imaging of a non-culprit coronary artery was performed in 581 patients who underwent coronary angiography. immunoglobulin g (igg) and a (iga) against porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were measured in plasma. results: none of the antibody levels were associated with coronary plaque burden, radiofreqeuncy-ivus-derived thin-cap fibroatheroma lesion morphology or 1-year incidence of major adverse cardiac events (mace), which included all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome and unplanned coronary revascularization. iga against a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. forsythia and p. intermedia were inversely associated with extent of positive lesion remodeling (or for highest versus lowest tertile 0.55, 95%ci 0.35-0.88, p  = 0.012; 0.53, 95%ci 0.32-0.87, p = 0.012; and 0.64, 95%ci 0.40-1.02, p = 0.061,  respectively). in diabetic patients specifically, igg against p. gingivalis tended to be associated with coronary plaque burden (p = 0.080), while iga against p. gingivalis tended to be associated with incident mace (p = 0.060). conclusion: plasma igg and iga against major periodontal pathogens were not associated with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis (with the exception of a trend in diabetics) nor with coronary plaque vulnerability. iga against periodontal pathogens were inversely associated with extent of coronary remodeling. altogether, these results do not add evidence for a substantial role  of systemic exposure to periodontal pathogens in coronary artery disease.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == variability of the dendritic cell response triggered by different serotypes of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis is toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) or tlr4 dependent.
AB  == background: different serotypes of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis have been shown to induce differential dendritic cell (dc) responses. this study investigates whether cytokine and cc-chemokine receptor (ccr) production by dcs stimulated with different serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis is toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) and/or tlr4 dependent. methods: dcs were obtained from healthy individuals and primed at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10(2) with different a. actinomycetemcomitans  or p. gingivalis serotypes in the presence or absence of anti-tlr2 or anti-tlr4 blocking antibodies. tlr2 and tlr4 expression, ccr5 and ccr6 expression, and interleukin (il)-1beta, il-10, il-12, and il-23 expression and secretion were quantified by flow cytometry, real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: when dcs were stimulated with serotype b of a. actinomycetemcomitans or serotype k1 of p. gingivalis, higher levels of tlr2 or tlr4, respectively, were detected compared to dcs stimulated with the other serotypes. similarly, higher levels of cytokines and ccrs were detected in serotype b- or serotype k1-primed dcs compared to the others, and these increased levels positively correlated with levels of tlr2 or tlr4. when tlr2 signaling was blocked using a specific anti-tlr2 monoclonal antibody, serotype b-induced cytokine and ccr expression was inhibited; when tlr4 signaling was blocked, serotype k1-induced response was inhibited. conclusions: these results demonstrate that the variability of secretion of cytokines and expression of ccrs detected in dcs stimulated with different serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis is tlr2 or tlr4 dependent, respectively.

TI  == real-time pcr quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva samples from  healthy young adults.
AB  == objective: the use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid for the evaluation of periodontal health has gained attention recently. most published real-time pcr assays focused on quantification of bacteria in subgingival plaque, not in saliva. the aims of this study were to develop a real-time pcr assay for quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva and to establish a relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and colony-forming unit (cfu). materials and methods: taqman primers/probe sets were used for the detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), and total bacteria. six periodontal pathogens and total bacteria in saliva from 24 periodontally healthy individuals  were determined. the relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and cfu was established by measuring the concentrations of extracted bacterial dna and cfu per milliliter of bacteria on agar plates. results: fn, ec, and pi were detected  in all saliva samples, while 58.5, 45.8, and 33.3% were detected for tf, pg, and  aa, respectively. numbers of ec and fn in saliva were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01). the values of dna (fg) per cfu ranged from 64 for ec to 121 for  pg. conclusion: the real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu can be used to quantitate periodontal pathogens in saliva and estimate the number of live bacteria (cfu). clinical relevance: this real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu has the potential to be an adjunct in evaluation of periodontal health status.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == nanoparticle-encapsulated chlorhexidine against oral bacterial biofilms.
AB  == background: chlorhexidine (chx) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure chx (nano-chx), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. methodology/principal findings: the release of chx from the nano-chx was characterized by uv/visible absorption spectroscopy. the antimicrobial properties of nano-chx were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. the nano-chx demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/ml against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and enterococccus faecalis. moreover, nano-chx effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as s. mutans, f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. conclusions/significance: this pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the nano-chx on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of exogenous nitric oxide on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == current treatments for periodontitis (e.g., scaling/root planing and chlorhexidine) have limited efficacy since they fail to suppress microbial biofilms satisfactorily over time, and the use of adjunctive antimicrobials can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. herein, we report the novel application of nitric oxide (no)-releasing scaffolds (i.e., dendrimers and  silica particles) as anti-periodontopathogenic agents. the effectiveness of macromolecular no release was demonstrated by a 3-log reduction in periodontopathogenic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis viability. in contrast, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis, caries-associated organisms, were substantially less sensitive to no treatment. both dendrimer- and silica-based no release exhibited substantially less toxicity to human gingival fibroblasts at concentrations necessary to eradicate periodontopathogens than did clinical concentrations of chlorhexidine.  these results suggest the potential utility of macromolecular no-release scaffolds as a novel platform for the development of periodontal disease therapeutics.

TI  == an in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: the impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. the aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. the  selected species used represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. the number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative pcr (qpcr). as outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. results: the bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. significance: while the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of  inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.

TI  == igg sera levels against a subset of periodontopathogens and severity of disease in aggressive periodontitis patients: a cross-sectional study of selected pocket  sites.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the association among serum immunoglobulin g (igg) responses to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) serotypes a, b and c, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf) and clinical parameters in aggressive  periodontitis (ap) subjects. associations between periodontal pathogens and clinical and immunological parameters were also evaluated. methods: thirty-eight  subjects diagnosed with generalized ap (gap) and localized ap (lap) were included. ten healthy controls were also evaluated. clinical parameters were assessed and percentages of subgingival levels of aa, pg and tf (beyond bacterial load), were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. serum igg antibody levels against aa, pg and tf were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: percentages of aa, pg and tf were significantly higher in ap than in controls. the response to aa serotype c was higher in lap subjects than in controls. there were no differences in microbial composition or  antibodies responses between gap and lap, except for igg response to tf. pg levels were correlated with probing depth (pd), bop and cal in gap but not in lap subjects. tf levels correlated with pd and cal in gap subjects. in gap, the infection levels of aa and pg correlated with the corresponding igg levels to aa  serotype c and pg. conclusion: given the evidences that igg response in ap patients correlated with bacterial infection level in gap, but not in lap, and that lap patients lack a response to tf, despite harbouring this species, our data suggest a difference in host immune defence between these two forms of aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == periodontopathogens and human beta-defensin-2 expression in gingival crevicular fluid from patients with periodontal disease in guangxi, china.
AB  == background and objective: periodontal diseases are often induced by periodontopathogens, which are always exposed to certain innate immune factors in gingival crevicular fluid, including human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2). this study aims to investigate the relationship among periodontopathogens, clinical parameters and hbd-2 expression. material and methods: thirty-two healthy controls, 42 patients with chronic gingivitis and 95 patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited in guangxi, china. bleeding index, probing depth and clinical attachment level were measured for all teeth including mesiobuccal, buccal, disobuccal, mesiolingual, lingual, disolingual six sites of all patient.  gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from the study sites. the prevalence and copy numbers (cn) of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia and total bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid were quantified by real-time pcr. the hbd-2 concentration in gingival crevicular fluid was measured  by elisa. results: both the prevalence and the cn of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls and patients with chronic gingivitis; however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of p. intermedia among the three study groups, and the highest cn was found in patients with chronic gingivitis, rather than in patients with chronic periodontitis. the loads of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. denticola and total bacteria were positively  related to probing depth, bleeding index and clinical attachment level. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid was higher in patients with chronic gingivitis and in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls. in addition, the hbd-2 concentration was positively related to the cn of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and total bacteria, as well as to bleeding index and probing depth. conclusion: the prevalence, composition and cn of periodontopathogens were closely related to the severity of periodontal disease,  and the red complex was related to the severity of clinical symptoms of periodontal diseases. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontal disease sites was higher than that in gingival crevicular fluid  from healthy sites, which suggests that hbd-2 expression might be up-regulated by periodontopathogens.

TI  == changes in oral microflora after full-mouth tooth extraction: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == aim: the aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of full-mouth tooth extraction on the oral microflora, with emphasis on the presence and load of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. material and  methods: adult patients (n = 30), with moderate to advanced periodontitis and scheduled for full-mouth tooth extraction, were consecutively selected. prior to  and 1 and 3 months after full-mouth tooth extraction saliva, tongue, buccal and gingival mucosa and subgingival plaque/prosthesis samples were obtained. aerobic  and anaerobic culture techniques and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) were employed for the detection of oral pathogens. results: full-mouth tooth extraction resulted in reduction below detection level of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis in 15 of 16 and 8 of 16 previously positive patients using culture techniques and qpcr, respectively. those patients remaining qpcr positive showed a significant reduction in load of these bacteria. conclusion: full-mouth tooth extraction significantly changes the oral microflora. these changes include reduction of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, frequently to levels below detection threshold. in some patients, a.  actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis can persist in the edentulous oral cavity up to 3 months after full-mouth tooth extraction.

TI  == chronic periodontitis genome-wide association studies: gene-centric and gene set  enrichment analyses.
AB  == recent genome-wide association studies (gwas) of chronic periodontitis (cp) offer rich data sources for the investigation of candidate genes, functional elements,  and pathways. we used gwas data of cp (n = 4,504) and periodontal pathogen colonization (n = 1,020) from a cohort of adult americans of european descent participating in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study and employed a magenta approach (i.e., meta-analysis gene set enrichment of variant associations) to obtain gene-centric and gene set association results corrected for gene size, number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and local linkage disequilibrium characteristics based on the human genome build 18 (national center for biotechnology information build 36). we used the gene ontology, ingenuity, kegg, panther, reactome, and biocarta databases for gene set enrichment analyses. six genes showed evidence of statistically significant association: 4 with severe cp (nin, p = 1.6 x 10(-7); abhd12b, p = 3.6 x 10(-7);  whamm, p = 1.7 x 10(-6); ap3b2, p = 2.2 x 10(-6)) and 2 with high periodontal pathogen colonization (red complex-kcnk1, p = 3.4 x 10(-7); porphyromonas gingivalis-dab2ip, p = 1.0 x 10(-6)). top-ranked genes for moderate cp were hgd (p = 1.4 x 10(-5)), znf675 (p = 1.5 x 10(-5)), tnfrsf10c (p = 2.0 x 10(-5)), and  emr1 (p = 2.0 x 10(-5)). loci containing nin, emr1, kcnk1, and dab2ip had showed  suggestive evidence of association in the earlier single-nucleotide polymorphism-based analyses, whereas whamm and ap2b2 emerged as novel candidates. the top gene sets included severe cp ("endoplasmic reticulum membrane," "cytochrome p450," "microsome," and "oxidation reduction") and moderate cp ("regulation of gene expression," "zinc ion binding," "bmp signaling pathway," and "ruffle"). gene-centric analyses offer a promising avenue for efficient interrogation of large-scale gwas data. these results highlight genes in previously identified loci and new candidate genes and pathways possibly associated with cp, which will need to be validated via replication and mechanistic studies.

TI  == rare case of generalised aggressive periodontitis in the primary dentition.
AB  == background: generalised aggressive periodontitis (ap) in the prepubescent age is  an exceptionally rare disease in the primary dentition of otherwise healthy children. characteristics of ap are gingival inflammation, deep periodontal pockets, bone loss, tooth mobility and even tooth loss. the most common way of treating this disease is the extraction of all the involved primary teeth. case report: a 4-year-old girl presented with signs of severe gingival inflammation. clinical examination revealed deep pockets, increased tooth mobility and bone loss. microbiological testing revealed the presence of a typical periopathogenic  flora consisting of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and the typical members of the red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola). the patient underwent tooth extraction of all primary teeth except the primary canines, followed by thorough root debridement and treatment with systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin plus metronidazole). follow-up: regular clinical and microbiological examinations over 4 years showed no signs of recurrence of a periodontitis, even in the erupted permanent teeth. conclusion: early diagnosis and consequent early treatment of aggressive periodontitis can stop the disease and therefore avoid the development of a periodontal disease in  the permanent dentition. a close collaboration between specialists of different disciplines is required for a favourable outcome.

TI  == hyperlipidemia causes changes in inflammatory responses to periodontal pathogen challenge: implications in acute and chronic infections.
AB  == objective: in this study, the effect of hyperlipidemia on immune responses to periodontal bacterial infections was investigated. methods: sixty male new zealand white rabbits were equally assigned to normal diet (nd) and high-fat diet (hfd) for 6 weeks. every six rabbits with nd or hfd were orally inoculated with live aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis three times a week for 8 weeks. also every six rabbits with nd or hfd rabbits were injected intravenously with a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis lps. periodontal disease severity was quantified by macroscopic and radiographical evaluation. serum cytokines were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. in vitro, peripheral mononuclear cells were collected and stimulated with lps. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the changes in gene expression of macrophages. results: in the early stages of infection, hfd rabbits were exposed to oral infection and systemic infection developed a weak inflammatory response to the reduced cytokine expression compared with nd rabbits. however, hfd rabbits exhibited higher inflammatory cytokine expression during long-term infections. moreover, the pronounced changes in inflammatory cytokine expression elicited a significantly increase in bone loss in hfd rabbits with oral infection. peripheral macrophages harvested from hfd rabbits and exposed to lps exhibited reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared with those from nd rabbits in vitro. conclusion: these data indicated that hyperlipidemia interfered with immune responses differently. the mechanism is possibly associated with immune paralysis in the acute phase and accumulation of inflammatory mediators in the chronic period.

TI  == development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  == background: inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. we therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model  to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (rsv) and gold standard  chlorhexidine (chx) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: an in vitro multi-species biofilm containing s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a  disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in okf6-tert2. cytotoxicity studies were performed using rsv and chx. multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were  treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. results: chx was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. rsv did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. in co-culture, chx-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine il-8 at both mrna and protein level. rsv-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of il-8 protein, but not mrna. conclusions: chx possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. rsv does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to  supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. this study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use  of a biofilm co-culture model.

TI  == periodontal pathogens and atherosclerosis: implications of inflammation and oxidative modification of ldl.
AB  == inflammation is well accepted to play a crucial role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions, and recent studies have demonstrated an association between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease. porphyromonas gingivalis  and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, causative agents of destructive chronic inflammation in the periodontium, can accelerate atheroma deposition in animal models. emerging evidence suggests that vaccination against virulence factors of these pathogens and anti-inflammatory therapy may confer disease resistance. in this review, we focus on the role of inflammatory mechanisms and oxidative modification in the formation and activation of atherosclerotic plaques accelerated by p. gingivalis or a. actinomycetemcomitans in an apoe-deficient mouse model and high-fat-diet-fed mice. furthermore, we examine whether mucosal vaccination with a periodontal pathogen or the anti-inflammatory activity of catechins can reduce periodontal pathogen-accelerated atherosclerosis.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaque.
AB  == background: there has been increasing attention paid in recent years to the possibility that oral bacterial infection, particularly periodontal disease may influence the initiation and or progression of systemic diseases. these studies confirm the observation that heart disease is the most commonly found systemic condition in patients with periodontal disease. moreover, the literature has also highlighted substantial evidence indicating the presence of gram-negative periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaques. aim: this study intends to investigate the possible association between periodontal health and coronary artery disease by evaluating periodontal status, association between the periodontal plaque and coronary atheromatous plaques for presence of micro-organisms such as, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia. materials and methods: a case-control study was designed with seven patients who had undergone  coronary endarterectomy for cardiovascular disease and 28 controls. the periodontal examination for cases was performed 1 day before vascular surgery and the controls were clinically examined. the atheromatous plaque sample collected during endarterectomy and the intraoral plaque samples were subjected to polymerase chain reaction for identification of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia. results: the presence of periodontal  bacteria dna in coronary atheromatous plaques and sub-gingival plaque samples of  the same patients was confirmed by this study. conclusion a correlation was established between putative bacteria contributing to atheromatous plaques and species associated with periodontal disease. one particularly important study to  be carried out is the investigation of a possible clinically meaningful reduction in coronary heart disease resulting from the prevention or treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == the interaction of implant luting cements and oral bacteria linked to peri-implant disease: an in vitro analysis of planktonic and biofilm growth - a preliminary study.
AB  == background: there is little consensus on the most appropriate cement to use when  restoring a cement-retained, implant-supported restoration. one consideration should be the interaction of pathogenic oral bacteria with restorative cements. purpose: to determine how oral bacteria associated with peri-implant disease grow in the presence of implant cements. materials and methods: five test cements with varying composition (zinc oxide-eugenol [tbo], eugenol-free zinc oxide [tbne], zinc orthophosphate [fl], and two resin cements [pic and ml]) were used to fabricate specimen disks. the disks were submerged in bacterial suspensions of either aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, or porphyromonas gingivalis. planktonic bacterial growth within the test media was measured by determining the optical density of the cultures (od600 ). positive controls (media and bacteria without cement disks) and negative controls (media alone) were similarly evaluated. the mean and standard deviations (sd) were calculated for planktonic growth from three separate experiments. anova statistical analysis with post hoc tukey tests was performed where differences existed (p < .05). selected cement disks (tbo and ml) were further examined for bacterial biofilm growth. surface bacteria were removed and grown on agar media,  and colony-forming units (cfus) were quantified. results: planktonic growth for both a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis was significantly inhibited (p <  .05) when grown in the presence of cement disks consisting of tbne, pic, fl, and  tbo. in contrast, neither of these bacteria displayed growth inhibition in the presence of ml cement disks. f. nucleatum growth was also significantly inhibited by pic, fl. and tbo (p < .05), but not by ml and tbne cement disks. cfu counts for the biofilm study for tbo gave minimal and, in some instances, no bacterial adherence and growth, in contrast to ml, which supported substantially greater bacterial biofilm growth. conclusion: cements display differing abilities to inhibit both planktonic and biofilm bacterial growth. cements with the ability to reduce planktonic or biofilm growth of the test bacteria may be advantageous in reducing peri-implant disease. understanding the microbial growth-inhibiting characteristics of different cement types should be considered important in the selection criteria.

TI  == inhibitory activity of myrtus communis oil on some clinically isolated oral pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to determine the antimicrobial activities of myrtus communis oil (mco) on some oral pathogens. material and methods: thirty strains of streptococcus mutans, aggregatibacteractinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and 20 strains of streptococcus pyogenes and candida albicans isolated from patients with dental caries, periodontal diseases, pharyngitis and oral lesions associated with artificial dentures were used for the antimicrobial activity of mco. the oil was prepared by hydrodistillation procedures using a clevenger apparatus. agar disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods were performed on various concentrations of mco (3.9-1,000 microg/ml) using all the pathogens isolated. results: all isolates were sensitive to mco at 125-1,000 microg/ml by agar disk diffusion producing inhibition zones of 8.1-41.25 mm in diameter. all of the s. pyogenes, s. mutans and c. albicans strains were sensitive to 62.5 microg/ml while 70% (21/30) of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 66.6% (20/30) of p. gingivalis were resistant to these concentrations. all s. pyogenes and s. mutans strains were sensitive to 31.25 microg/ml. all s. pyogenes strains were sensitive to 15.6 and 7.8 microg/ml of mco. none of the clinical isolates in this study were sensitive to 3.9 microg/ml or to a lower concentration of oil. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of mco for s. pyogenes, s. mutans, c. albicans, a.actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were  29.68 +/- 4.8, 31.25 +/- 0, 46.9 +/- 16, 62.5 +/- 0 and 62.5 +/- 0 microg/ml, respectively. conclusions: data obtained in this study revealed a strong antimicrobial activity of mco on the tested oral pathogens, and mco could therefore be useful in the prevention of the related oral infections.

TI  == internal bacterial colonization of implants: association with peri-implant bone loss.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present longitudinal study was to investigate bacterial colonization of the internal implant cavity and to evaluate a possible  association with peri-implant bone loss. methods: a total of 264 paper point samples were harvested from the intra-implant cavity of 66 implants in 26 patients immediately following implant insertion and after 3, 4, and 12 months. samples were evaluated for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola,  and tannerella forsythia as well as total bacterial counts by real-time pcr. bone loss was evaluated on standardized radiographs up to 25 months after implant insertion. for the statistical analysis of the data, mixed effects models were fitted. results: there was an increase in the frequency of detection as well as in the mean counts of the selected bacteria over time. the evaluation of the target bacteria revealed a significant association of pr. intermedia at 4 and 12  months with peri-implant bone loss at 25 months (4 months: p = 0.009; 12 months:  p = 0.021). conclusions: the present study could demonstrate a progressive colonization by periodontopathogenic bacteria in the internal cavities of two-piece implants. the results suggest that internal colonization with pr. intermedia was associated with peri-implant bone loss.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher  levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens of the mandibular third molar pericoronitis by using real time pcr.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the mandibular third molar pericoronitis flora by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: the quantitative values of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi) and tannerella forsythia (tf) were evaluated in comparison with the healthy third molar flora by using real time pcr. results: aa, cr, pg, and pi were not statistically significant but numerically higher than the pericoronitis group. in contrast to samples from control subjects, statistically significant higher numbers of tf were detected in samples from pericoronitis patients. the study revealed the strong relation between risk of pericoronitis and the presence of tf. individuals who have tf in  their samples present with an almost eight times relative risk of pericoronitis as the individuals with an absence of tf in their samples. conclusion: tf plays an important role in the development of clinical symptoms related to pericoronitis.

TI  == subgingival bacteria in ghanaian adolescents with or without progression of attachment loss.
AB  == objective: this study describes subgingival bacterial profiles associated with clinical periodontal status in ghanaian adolescents with or without progression of attachment loss. materials and methods: among 500 adolescents included in a cohort study, 397 returned 2 years later for a periodontal re-examination, including full-mouth cal measurements. at follow-up, a subgroup of 98 adolescents was also subjected to bacterial sampling with paper points at four periodontal sites (mesial aspect of 11, 26, 31, and 46) and analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique against dna-probes from nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species. results: the 98 ghanaian adolescents  examined in the present study were similar to the entire group examined at the 2-year follow-up with respect to age, gender, and cal >/=3 mm. a high detection frequency of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia (>99%) using checkerboard analysis was found, while for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  the detection frequency was <50%. a strong correlation was found at the individual level between the presence of p. intermedia and the total cal change,  and p. intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis were strongly correlated with a change in cal and probing pocket depth (ppd) at the sampled sites. in a linear regression model, a significant discriminating factor for the total cal change in the dentition during the 2-year follow-up period was obtained for p. intermedia and public school. conclusion: this study indicates that subgingival bacterial species other than a. actinomycetemcomitans, for example, p. intermedia, have a significant association with periodontal breakdown (change in cal) in ghanaian adolescents with progression of periodontal attachment loss.

TI  == relationship between expression of human gingival beta-defensins and levels of periodontopathogens in subgingival plaque.
AB  == background and objective: human beta-defensins (hbds) are a group of antimicrobial peptides important in epithelial innate immunity, and their differential expression is associated with periodontal diseases. the aim of this  study was to explore relationships among hbds, total subgingival bacteria and periodontopathogens in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: the periodontal clinical parameters of 29 healthy subjects and 25 patients with chronic periodontitis were recorded. the relative expression of hbd1, hbd2 and hbd3 genes in gingival biopsies was measured using real-time pcr. the numbers of total bacteria and of treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque were quantified by real-time pcr. data were analyzed using the mann-whitney u-test and spearman's rank correlation test. results: no significant differences in expression of the hbd genes were found between the group of healthy subjects and  the group of patients with chronic periodontitis. total bacteria and t. denticola were detected in all participants. f. nucleatum and t. forsythia were detected in all patients with chronic periodontitis and in 86.21% and 51.72%, respectively, of healthy volunteers. p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in 24.14% and 17.24%, respectively, of the healthy group and in 84.00% and 12.00%, respectively, of the chronic periodontitis group. the prevalence of all bacteria, except a. actinomycetemcomitans, was significantly higher in the group  of patients with chronic periodontitis than in the group of healthy subjects (p < 0.05). a significant, negative correlation was observed between total bacteria and hbd-2 (r = -0.384, p = 0.011). upon analyzing the data in different groups, total bacteria and hbd-2 were significantly correlated (r = -0.492, p = 0.026) only in the group of healthy subjects. conclusion: the negative correlations between hbd-2 and total bacteria, especially in the group of healthy subjects, indicate that hbds may play an important role by limiting an increase of bacterial load at the initial stage of periodontitis.

TI  == high incidence of periodontitis in japanese patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.
AB  == periodontitis is known to be a risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa). however, the influence of periodontitis on aaa in japanese patients has not yet been elucidated. the aim of this clinical investigation was to assess the relationship between periodontal bacterial burden in aaa patients.we studied 12 aaa patients and 24 age- and sex-matched non-aaa cardiovascular patients. we examined periodontitis and the presence of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia in oral samples using polymerase chain reaction assays.we found that the aaa patients had deeper pocket depth compared to the non-aaa patients (3.53 +/- 0.38 mm versus 2.67 +/- 0.17 mm, p < 0.05). however, the populations of periodontal bacteria were comparable between the two groups. periodontitis may have a greater effect on aneurysm progression compared to other cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == systemic exposure to a common periodontal pathogen and missing teeth are associated with metabolic syndrome.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic infection of tooth-supporting tissues leading to tooth loss. two of the major periodontal pathogens are aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. clinically diagnosed periodontitis has been associated with metabolic syndrome (mets). the aim of the  study was to investigate the association of serum antibody levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis and the number of missing teeth with mets. the population was the pais subcohort of the finrisk '97 study (n = 1,354). the subjects were men aged 45-74 years, and they participated in this cardiovascular risk factor survey in finland. a total of 534 (39 %) subjects had  mets defined according to the guidelines of the international diabetes federation. serum antibody levels against the pathogens were measured by multiserotype elisa. a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody levels and the number of missing teeth were significantly higher in subjects with a large waist circumference or with low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. the number  of missing teeth was also higher among subjects with a high serum triglyceride concentration or high plasma glucose concentration. seropositivity for a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly associated with mets with an odds ratio (or) 1.42 (95 % confidence interval 1.09-1.85, p = 0.009). more than four missing teeth and complete edentulousness were also significantly associated with mets with ors 1.69 (1.26-2.27, p < 0.001) and 1.93 (1.30-2.86, p = 0.001), respectively. missing teeth and systemic exposure to a. actinomycetemcomitans were associated with several components of mets. infection with this common pathogen or the host response against it is associated with the presence of mets.

TI  == a periodontitis-associated multispecies model of an oral biofilm.
AB  == purpose: while single-species biofilms have been studied extensively, we know notably little regarding multispecies biofilms and their interactions. the purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an in vitro multispecies dental biofilm model that aimed to mimic the environment of chronic periodontitis. methods: streptococcus gordonii kn1, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc23726, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc33384, and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc33277 were used for this experiment. the biofilms were grown on 12-well plates with a round glass slip (12 mm in diameter) with a supply of fresh medium. four different single-species biofilms and multispecies biofilms with the four bacterial strains listed above were prepared. the biofilms were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (clsm) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for four different planktonic single-species and multispecies bacteria were determined. the mics of doxycycline and chlorhexidine for four different single-species biofilms and a multispecies biofilm were also determined. results: the clsm and sem examination revealed that the growth pattern of the multispecies biofilm was similar to those of single-species biofilms. however, the multispecies biofilm became thicker than the single-species biofilms, and networks between bacteria were formed. the mics  of doxycycline and chlorhexidine were higher in the biofilm state than in the planktonic bacteria. the mic of doxycycline for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, or a. actinomycetemcomitans. the mic of chlorhexidine for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. conclusions: to mimic the natural dental biofilm, a multispecies biofilm composed of four bacterial species was grown. the 24-hour multispecies biofilm may be useful as a laboratory dental biofilm model system.

TI  == periodontitis in cardiovascular disease patients with or without marfan syndrome--a possible role of prevotella intermedia.
AB  == background: although periodontitis is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (cvd), the influence of periodontitis on marfan syndrome (mfs) with cvd is unclear. the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between periodontal bacterial burden and msf with cvd. methods and results: the subjects were patients with mfs with cvd (n = 47); age and gender matched non-mfs cvd patients  (n = 48) were employed as controls. full-mouth clinical measurements, including number of teeth, probing of pocket depth (pd), bleeding on probing (bop) and community periodontal index (cpi) were recorded. we also evaluated the existence  of three periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia using polymerase chain reaction  assays. serum antibody titers against the pathogens were also measured. we revealed that mfs with cvd patients had periodontitis more frequently than the age and gender matched non-mfs cvd control subjects. mfs with cvd patients had significantly severer periodontitis, fewer remaining teeth and deeper pd compared to the non-mfs cvd controls. furthermore, the serum antibody titer level against  prevotella intermedia was significantly lower in mfs plus cvd patients compared to the non-mfs cvd patients. conclusion: periodontitis may influence the pathophysiology of cardiovascular complications in mfs patients. a specific periodontal pathogen might be a crucial therapeutic target to prevent cvd development.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == incidence of periodontitis in japanese patients with cardiovascular diseases: a comparison between abdominal aortic aneurysm and arrhythmia.
AB  == although there is a link between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd),  the influence of periodontitis on cvd is unclear. the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between periodontal bacterial burden and cvd. we studied  142 patients with tachyarrhythmia (ta) and 25 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa). we examined periodontitis and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia in the patients' saliva and subgingival plaque using pcr. we also measured serum antibody titers against the pathogens using elisa. we found that the patients with aaa had fewer remaining teeth (14.6 +/- 2.0 vs. 20.9 +/- 0.7, p < 0.05) and  deeper pocket depth (3.01 +/- 0.26 vs. 2.52 +/- 0.05 mm, p < 0.05) compared to the ta patients. the existence of each periodontal bacterium in their saliva or subgingival plaque and serum antibody titers was comparable between the two groups. periodontitis may have a larger affect on aneurysm progression compared to arrhythmia.

TI  == genetic characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == periodontal disease is caused by a group of bacteria that utilize a variety of strategies and molecular mechanisms to evade or overcome host defenses. recent research has uncovered new evidence illuminating interesting aspects of the virulence of these bacteria and their genomic variability. this paper summarizes  some of the strategies utilized by the major species - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis - implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. whole-genome sequencing of 14 diverse a. actinomycetemcomitans strains has revealed variations in their genetic content (ranging between 0.4% and 19.5%) and organization. strikingly, isolates from human periodontal sites showed no genomic changes during persistent colonization. t. forsythia manipulates the cytokine responses of macrophages and monocytes through its surface glycosylation. studies have revealed that bacterial surface-expressed o-linked glycans modulate t-cell responses during periodontal inflammation. periodontal pathogens belonging to the "red complex" consortium express neuraminidases, which enables them to scavenge sialic acid from host glycoconjugates. analysis of recent data has demonstrated that the cleaved sialic acid acts as an important nutrient for bacterial growth and a molecule for the decoration of bacteria surfaces to help evade the host immune attack. in addition, bacterial entry into host cells is also an important  prerequisite for the lifestyle of periodontal pathogens such as p. gingivalis. studies have shown that, after its entry into the cell, this bacterium uses multiple sorting pathways destined for autophagy, lysosomes, or recycling pathways. in addition, p. gingivalis releases outer membrane vesicles which enter cells via endocytosis and cause cellular functional impairment.

TI  == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

TI  == an in-vitro evaluation of the efficacy of garlic extract as an antimicrobial agent on periodontal pathogens: a microbiological study.
AB  == with the rise in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, there is considerable interest in the development of other classes of antimicrobials for the control of infection. garlic (allium sativum linn.) has been used as medicine since ancient  times and has long been known to have antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. this study was undertaken to assess the inhibitory effect of garlic on porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, to assess  the time-kill curve of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans, and to determine the antiproteolytic activity of garlic on p. gingivalis. ethanolic garlic extract (ege) and aqueous garlic extract (age) were prepared and the inhibitory effects of these extracts for two periodontal pathogens (p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans) were tested. antiproteolytic activity on protease of p. gingivalis was determined. 25 microliter (mul), 50 mul, and 75 mul of age showed 16 mm, 20 mm, and 25 mm zone of inhibition, respectively, on p. gingivalis. the age showed greater bacteriostatic activity against the p. gingivalis with minimum inhibitory concentration determined at 16.6 mul/ml. the time-kill assay of age and ege were compared for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. age showed better antiproteolytic activity on total protease of p. gingivalis compared to the ege. thus, the study concludes the antimicrobial activity of garlic extract against periodontal pathogens, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans. its action against p. gingivalis includes inhibition of total protease activity, and this raises the possibility that garlic may have therapeutic use for periodontitis and possibly other oral infections.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection  (test group 3). samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out for total bacterial count and for 10 microorganisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and candida albicans. the response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. the relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. results: regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. statistical significance was  only reached for treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria  but only for peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. test  groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. conclusions: outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. however, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis gingipain is involved in the detachment and aggregation  of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans biofilm.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are major periodontal pathogens that cause several types of periodontal disease. our previous study suggested that p. gingivalis gingipains secreted in the subgingival environment are related to the detachment of a.actinomycetemcomitans  biofilms. however, it remains unclear whether arginine-specific cysteine proteinase (rgp) and lysine-specific proteinase (kgp) play different roles in the detachment of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm. the aim of this study was to investigate possible disruptive roles of kgp and rgp in the aggregation and attachment of a. actinomycetemcomitans. while p. gingivalis atcc33277 culture supernatant has an ability to decrease autoaggregation and coaggregation of a. actinomycetemcomitans cells, neither the boiled culture supernatant of atcc33277  nor the culture supernatant of kdp136 showed this ability. the addition of kyt-1  and kyt-36, specific inhibitors of rgp and kgp, respectively, showed no influence on the ability of p. gingivalis culture supernatant. the result of gelatin zymography suggested that other proteases processed by gingipains mediated the decrease of a. actinomycetemcomitans aggregations. we also examined the biofilm-destructive effect of gingipains by assessing the detachment of a. actinomycetemcomitans from polystyrene surfaces. scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that a. actinomycetemcomitans cells were detached by p. gingivalis kgp. the quantity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in biofilm was decreased in co-culture with p. gingivalis. however, this was not found after the addition  of kyt-36. these findings suggest that kgp is a critical component for the detachment and decrease of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms.

AB  == there is neither a single clinical, microbiological, histopathological or genetic test, nor combinations of them, to discriminate aggressive periodontitis (agp) from chronic periodontitis (cp) patients. we aimed to estimate probability density functions of clinical and immunologic datasets derived from periodontitis patients and construct artificial neural networks (anns) to correctly classify patients into agp or cp class. the fit of probability distributions on the datasets was tested by the akaike information criterion (aic). anns were trained  by cross entropy (ce) values estimated between probabilities of showing certain levels of immunologic parameters and a reference mode probability proposed by kernel density estimation (kde). the weight decay regularization parameter of the anns was determined by 10-fold cross-validation. possible evidence for 2 clusters of patients on cross-sectional and longitudinal bone loss measurements were revealed by kde. two to 7 clusters were shown on datasets of cd4/cd8 ratio, cd3,  monocyte, eosinophil, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, il-1, il-2, il-4, inf-gamma and tnf-alpha level from monocytes, antibody levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) and p.gingivalis (p.g.). anns gave 90%-98% accuracy  in classifying patients into either agp or cp. the best overall prediction was given by an ann with ce of monocyte, eosinophil, neutrophil counts and cd4/cd8 ratio as inputs. anns can be powerful in classifying periodontitis patients into  agp or cp, when fed by ce values based on kde. therefore anns can be employed for accurate diagnosis of agp or cp by using relatively simple and conveniently obtained parameters, like leukocyte counts in peripheral blood. this will allow clinicians to better adapt specific treatment protocols for their agp and cp patients.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of levofloxacin in the treatment of chronic  periodontitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  == aim: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effect of systemic levofloxacin (lfx) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: sixty-five patients with cp were randomly divided into a test (n = 33, srp and lfx 500 mg, once daily [o.d.]) and a control group (n = 32, srp and placebo, o.d.). plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), percentage of sites with bleeding  on probing (%bop), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal) were recorded at baseline, 10 days, and 1-, 3-, and 6-month intervals. the percentage  of sites positive for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were recorded at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. results: patients receiving lfx showed statistically-significant improvements in mean pd and cal. the intergroup  difference in pi, gi, and%bop was not significant at any interval. there was a reduction in the percentage of sites positive for periodontopathic bacteria over  the duration of the study in both groups, and a statistically-significant reduction in the number of sites positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans in the lfx group (p < 0.001). conclusion: levofloxacin was found to significantly improve the clinical and microbiological parameters in cp individuals.

TI  == photodynamic therapy during supportive periodontal care: clinical, microbiologic, immunoinflammatory, and patient-centered performance in a split-mouth randomized  clinical trial.
AB  == background: this study investigates the effect of photodynamic therapy (pdt) as monotherapy during supportive periodontal therapy. methods: a split-mouth, randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with chronic periodontitis  (n = 22) presenting at least three residual pockets (probing depth [pd] >/=5 mm with bleeding on probing [bop]). the selected sites randomly received the following: 1) pdt; 2) photosensitizer (ps); or 3) scaling and root planing (srp). at baseline and 3 and 6 months, clinical, microbiologic (real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses), cytokine pattern (multiplexed bead immunoassay), and patient-centered (regarding morbidity) evaluations were performed. results: all therapies promoted similar improvements in clinical parameters throughout the study (p <0.05), except that bop was not reduced in the ps protocol (p >0.05). lower levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were observed in the pdt and srp protocols at 3 months when compared with the ps protocol (p <0.05). an inferior frequency detection of porphyromonas gingivalis was observed in the pdt  protocol at 3 and 6 months and in the srp protocol at 6 months from baseline (p <0.05). in addition, pdt protocol presented inferior frequency of p. gingivalis at 3 months when compared with the other therapies (p <0.05). only patients in the pdt protocol exhibited augmented levels of anti-inflammatory interleukin (il)-4 and reduced proinflammatory il-1beta and il-6 throughout the study (p <0.05). intergroup analyses showed reduced il-10 and increased interferon-gamma and il-1beta levels in the ps protocol when compared with the other therapies during follow-ups (p <0.05). no differences in morbidity were observed between the therapies (p >0.05), although the need for anesthesia was higher in srp-treated sites (p <0.05). conclusion: pdt as an exclusive therapy may be considered a non-invasive alternative for treating residual pockets, offering advantages in the modulation of cytokines.

TI  == [dissertations 25 years after date 37. susceptibility to periodontal diseases].
AB  == in the eighties of the former century it was observed that individuals had different modes of development of periodontitis, largely for unknown reasons. it  was assumed that periodontal disease developed as a result of the presence of virulent micro-organisms in combination with an inadequate host response. the concept of this (im)balance in host parasite interactions developed further, in part because of new research techniques. with respect to oral bacteria it was shown that periodontal pathogens like aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are risk factors for periodontitis. furthermore, genetic polymorphisms (snp's) have been shown to modulate the host response against the periopathogens. medical and lifestyle factors, e.g. diabetes mellitus, smoking, psychological stress and, to a minor extent, also hormonal changes can have an impact on the progression of periodontitis. all this information contributes to determining the individual risk profile of a patient for developing periodontitis and for estimating the prognosis of periodontal treatment and maintenance care on an individual basis.

TI  == prevelance of periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival biofilm and atherosclerotic plaques of patients undergoing coronary revascularization surgery.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to detect the presence of specific periodontopathogenic bacteria in the coronary plaque of patients with coronary artery disease and to find out the significant association between the periodontal status and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the coronary plaque. materials and methods: the study population consisted of 51 patients with chronic generalized periodontitis undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. periodontal parameters were recorded and deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from the subgingival plaque and coronary atherosclerotic plaque samples of the same patients. polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the part of 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) gene to detect the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), porphyromonas gingivali (pg), porphyromonas gingivalis (fima) gene and treponema denticola (td). results: aa, tf, pg, pg (fima) gene and td were detected in 0%, 31.4%, 45.1% 39.2% and 51% of atherosclerotic plaque samples, respectively. tf was detected in 19.6%, pg in  39.2%, pg (fima) gene in 33.3% and td in 35.3% of both, subgingival plaque and atherosclerotic plaque samples. periodontal parameters correlated with the presence of bacteria in coronary plaque. aa could not be detected in coronary plaque samples. conclusions: the study confirmed the detection of red complex bacteria in coronary plaque samples and these bacteria correlated with the severity of periodontal destruction.

TI  == application of a diode laser in the reduction of targeted periodontal pathogens.
AB  == introduction: periodontal disease belongs to a group of diseases with more than one cause, it is a disease of a multifactorial etiology. although bacteria are the main cause of the disease, immunoinflammatory reaction of the host is responsible for the majority of destructive changes in periodontal tissue. the main issue in the evaluation of the success of periodontal therapy is the pluralism of the bacteria and their dynamic changes during the duration, on the one hand, and the possible inaccuracy of classical microbiological analysis in determination of the dominant role of a microorganism, or the success of its reduction or elimination, on the other. thanks to advances of microbiology and technological development, it is possible to make an assessment of specific microorganisms in a large number of samples of sub-gingival plaque with extreme precision, using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and method of polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the development of laser technology and the discovery of its significant antimicrobial effects have introduced and presented this treatment modality as a possible auxiliary method of periodontitis treatment. materials and methods: the sample for the study estimating the efficiency of application of diode lasers in the reduction of periodontal pockets consisted of  1164 periodontal pockets in 24 subjects of both sexes. for laser irradiation of periodontal pockets a diode laser was used, a low-power laser (smilepro 980, biolitec, germany), working in a mode precisely tuned for treatment of periodontal pockets. all subjects underwent: general anamnesis, periodontal status, and orthopantogram radiograph analysis. following a standard periodontal  preparation, a sample of subgingival plaque was collected for molecular-biological analysis (real-time pcr method) prior to laser irradiation of periodontal pockets, immediately following the irradiation, and during the control examination 3 months after irradiation. results: the results of the molecular-biological analysis of target periodontal pathogens actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) isolated from periodontal pockets prior to laser irradiation, immediately after laser irradiation, and at the control examination after 3 months were processed statistically (using real-time pcr method). the results showed that there was a statistically significant decrease in ct values for the tested bacteria immediately after treatment and the control examination, compared with the level  of ct values for the same bacteria before treatment. conclusions: based on the obtained results, we concluded that diode laser irradiation reduces the number of active periodontal pathogens. we believe that the use of diode lasers, as a supplementary method in the treatment of periodontal disease, is extremely useful and efficient, and can be recommended as part of standard clinical practice.

TI  == subgingival plaque sampling after combined mechanical and antibiotic nonsurgical  periodontal therapy.
AB  == aim: this study aimed to make a comparison of two sampling strategies of subgingival plaque after combined mechanical-antibiotic periodontal therapy. methods: thirty patients (18 female) suffering from aggressive (n = 12) or generalised severe chronic (n = 18) periodontitis were included. aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans had been detected subgingivally in all prior to anti-infective therapy (at) and combined mechanical-antibiotic at had been rendered. after at clinical examinations were performed and subgingival plaque was sampled from the same four sites as prior to at (aspre) as well as from the four deepest sites after at (deep). per patient two pooled samples (aspre/deep) were generated and analysed for a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola using a commercial 16s rrna test. results: aspre failed to detect a. actinomycetemcomitans, deep detected a. actinomycetemcomitans only in two patients (7 %). only for t. forsythia deep (53 %) provided higher detection frequencies than aspre (27 %; p = 0.005). detection frequencies of p. gingivalis and t. denticola ranged from 47 to 53 %. conclusion: after combined mechanical-antibiotic at sampling the deepest sites revealed higher detection rates. combined mechanical-antibiotic at suppresses a. actinomycetemcomitans to a higher extent than p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola.

TI  == subgingival periodontal pathogens associated with chronic periodontitis in yemenis.
AB  == background: subgingival microbial profile associated with periodontitis has been  reported to significantly differ by geographical location. the purpose of this study was to assess the association between a panel of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens and chronic periodontitis among yemenis. methods: subgingival dna samples were obtained from diseased and healthy sites of 20 non-smoking, moderate to severe chronic periodontitis subjects. absolute counts (bacterial dna copies per sample) and relative counts (% total bacteria) of seven periopathogenic species/genera representative of the red and orange complexes were determined using taqman q-pcr assays. results: the q-pcr assays showed excellent linearity (r2 > 0.99) and a sensitivity of 100 copies/sample. the detection rate was 100% for all tested species/genera except for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans that were detected at 97.5% and 67.5%, respectively. the median log absolute counts were in the range of 2.41-6.53 copies per sample while median relative counts were in the range of 0.001-0.77%, both being highest for fusobacteria and lowest for a. actinomycetemcomitans. significant interspecies correlations were observed. adjusting for multiple comparisons (p</=0.0063), only t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. micra maintained significant association with periodontal destruction. the latter species, however, showed the strongest association and was found in higher proportions at the periodontitis sites across all subjects (3.39 median fold increase). no significant differences were observed for p. gingivalis. conclusions: p. micra rather than p. gingivalis  appears as a keystone pathogen in this yemeni sample. however, these findings need to be validated in a larger-scale study before they can be claimed to represent ethnic variations in pathogens' association with periodontitis.

TI  == quantification of periodontal pathogens in vascular, blood, and subgingival samples from patients with peripheral arterial disease or abdominal aortic aneurysms.
AB  == background: the aim of this investigation is to quantify periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, and tannerella forsythia) in vascular, blood, and subgingival samples. as a secondary objective, two molecular bacterial identification methods (nested polymerase chain reaction [pcr] and quantitative pcr [qpcr]) are compared. methods: seventy consecutive patients provided a vascular lesion, a blood sample, and 36 subgingival samples. bacterial dna was extracted, and qpcr was used to determine the prevalence and amounts of the target pathogens in each sample. nested pcr was performed only in the samples from vascular lesions. periodontal examination was performed in 42 patients. mann-whitney u or chi(2) tests were used to compare microbiologic results according to periodontal diagnosis. results: all targeted periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, or c. rectus) were detected in subgingival samples, with a prevalence rate of 72.2%, 47.2%, 74.3%, and 82.9%, respectively. in 7.1% and 11.4% of vascular and blood samples, bacterial dna was detected. one patient  was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans in the three types of samples. no differences were found in the levels of targeted bacteria when comparing patients with and without periodontitis. prevalence rates obtained with nested pcr were significantly higher than those obtained with qpcr. conclusions: the presence of  a. actinomycetemcomitans was demonstrated in vascular, blood, and subgingival samples in one of 36 patients. these results, although with a very low frequency, may support the hypothesis of a translocation of periodontal pathogens from subgingival microbiota to the bloodstream and then to atheromatous plaques in carotid or other peripheral arteries. nested pcr is not an adequate method for identifying dna of periodontal pathogens in low quantities because of the high number of false-negative results.

AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == in vitro-activity of oily calcium hydroxide suspension on microorganisms as well  as on human alveolar osteoblasts and periodontal ligament fibroblasts.
AB  == background: findings from animal and human studies have indicated that an oily calcium hydroxide suspension (ochs) may improve early wound healing in the treatment of periodontitis. calcium hydroxide as the main component is well known for its antimicrobial activity, however at present the effect of ochs on the influence of periodontal wound healing/regeneration is still very limited. the purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of ochs on periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as on the attachment and proliferation of osteoblasts and periodontal ligament fibroblasts. methods: human alveolar osteoblasts (hao) and periodontal ligament (pdl) fibroblasts were cultured on 3 concentrations of ochs (2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg). adhesion and proliferation were counted up to 48 h and mineralization was assayed after 1 and 2 weeks. furthermore potential growth inhibitory activity on microorganisms associated with periodontal disease (e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) as well as the influence of periodontopathogens and ochs on the hao and pdl fibroblasts counts were determined. results: more than a 2-fold increase in adherent hao cells was observed at 4 h following application of ochs when compared to the control group  (p = 0.007 for 2.5 mg). proliferation of hao cells at 48 h was stimulated by moderate concentrations (2.5 mg; 5 mg) of ochs (each p < 0.001), whereas a high concentration (7.5 mg) of ochs was inhibitory (p = 0.009). mineralization was observed only for hao cells treated with ochs. ochs did not exert any positive effect on attachment or proliferation of pdl fibroblasts. although ochs did not have an antibacterial effect, it did positively influence attachment and proliferation of hao cells and pdl fibroblasts in the presence of periodontopathogens. conclusions: the present data suggests that ochs promotes osteoblast attachment, proliferation and mineralization in a concentration-dependent manner and results are maintained in the presence of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == photodynamic antimicrobial effect of safranine o on an ex vivo periodontal biofilm.
AB  == background and objective: the increasing resistance of oral pathogens against antibiotic measures urgently requires new therapeutic strategies. in this context, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) may play a crucial part in the future. the aim of the present study was to compare the antibacterial efficiency  of apdt using the photosensitizer safranine o with that of chlorhexidine (0.2% chx) on an ex vivo biofilm. methods: first the antibacterial activity of both measures against planktonic cultures of streptococcus gordonii atcc 33399, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 33384 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 was observed. then a patient specific ex vivo biofilm was established  from plaque and saliva samples of patients (n = 19) with chronic periodontitis. the antibacterial effects of apdt and of 0.2% chx were determined on the ex vivo  biofilms cultivated for 24 and 72 hours. after cultivation of the treated samples on blood agar (2 days) the results were quantified by counting the colony forming units (cfu/ml). results: photodynamic treatment with safranine o showed a distinct antibacterial effect on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. whereas s. gordonii was suppressed completely by apdt, treatment with 0.2% chx caused only a partial reduction. in the ex vivo biofilm model (24-hour biofilm), apdt caused a  significantly higher bacterial killing than treatment with 0.2% chx. compared to  the untreated control, there was no significant difference on the 72-hour biofilm for both methods. conclusions: the results show that oral-pathogenic species in planktonic solution can be suppressed significantly by apdt with safranine o. especially for bacteria in a 24-hour ex vivo biofilm, this method is more effective than treatment with 0.2% chx. both antibacterial treatments did not show any significant effect on the biofilm cultivated for 72 hours.

TI  == serum c-reactive protein and immunoglobulin g antibodies to periodontal pathogens may be effect modifiers of periodontitis and hyperglycemia.
AB  == background: serum c-reactive protein (crp) is elevated in both periodontitis and  type 2 diabetes mellitus through inflammation. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis have been found in periodontal pockets in patients with diabetes. this study examines effect modification by examining the extent to which the associations between periodontitis and hyperglycemia were different by levels of serum crp and periodontal pathogens. methods: blood samples with plasma were evaluated for immunoglobulin g antibodies, crp, and fasting glucose from 5,731 participants >/= 20 years old receiving oral examinations and providing other health-related data from the national health and nutrition examination survey iii. the study participants were classified into quartiles of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the first quartile was the reference. logistic regression models with survey procedures were used to explore the roles of inflammation levels from serum crp and periodontal pathogens on the relations with periodontitis, including pd, cal, and hyperglycemia, and their joint associations with interaction terms. results: stronger associations between pd and diabetes existed in people having elevated crp and titers for p. gingivalis; odds ratios comparing extreme quartiles of pd were 1.31 and 3.40 in the groups with low and high crp, respectively, and 1.28 and 2.96 in groups with low and high titers for p. gingivalis, respectively. the joint association patterns were similar for cal and diabetes. conclusions: the strengths of association between periodontitis and diabetes were stronger in people having elevated serum crp and p. gingivalis titers. this may suggest that chronic inflammatory conditions could increase the  impact of periodontitis on hyperglycemic status.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == biology and pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus in periodontal disease.
AB  == human periodontitis is associated with a wide range of bacteria and viruses and with complex innate and adaptive immune responses. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses are major suspected pathogens of periodontitis, and a combined herpesvirus-bacterial periodontal infection can potentially explain major clinical features of the disease. cytomegalovirus infects periodontal macrophages and t-cells and elicits a release of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. these proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in the host defense against the virus, but they  also have the potential to induce alveolar bone resorption and loss of periodontal ligament. gingival fibroblasts infected with cytomegalovirus also exhibit diminished collagen production and release of an increased level of matrix metalloproteinases. this article reviews innate and adaptive immunity to cytomegalovirus and suggests that immune responses towards cytomegalovirus can play roles in controlling, as well as in exacerbating, destructive periodontal disease.

TI  == oral prophylaxis and its effects on halitosis-associated and inflammatory parameters in patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: a controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of oral prophylaxis on halitosis-associated, immunological and microbiological parameters. methods: thirty subjects were included in this controlled clinical trial (patients with generalized chronic periodontitis and controls without clinical attachment loss; each n = 15). before oral prophylaxis and 14 days after (including tongue cleaning) volatile sulphur compounds (vsc), organoleptic scores and a tongue coating index were evaluated. the levels of il-1beta, il-8, il-10 and mmp-8 were measured in gcf, and also major periodontal pathogens were detected. data were statistically analysed using anova and paired t-test. results: supragingival plaque and calculus removal with combined tongue cleaning  was able to reduce significantly (p < 0.05) the vsc values in both groups (no significant differences between both groups). two weeks after periodontal debridement, the vsc values were observed in the periodontitis group, but not in  the control group, similar to the baseline values. the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). only a repeated prophylaxis session in the periodontitis group was able to reduce vsc values significantly in comparison with baseline (p < 0.05). organoleptic scores (10 and 30 cm) were significantly different (p < 0.05) between both groups before and after the treatment. periodontal pathogens and host-derived markers were not significantly  affected by a single prophylaxis session. conclusions: oral prophylaxis may result in a significant decrease in vsc values. however, in periodontal diseases, a more complex treatment seems to be necessary.

TI  == antibiogram pattern of oral microflora in periodontic children of age group 6 to  12 years: a clinicomicrobiological study.
AB  == aim: the study was carried out to see the diversity of oral microflora and its antibiotic sensitivity test in children of age group 6 to 12 years was carried. materials and methods: total 50 patients of age group 6 to 12 years were analyzed for their oral microflora and then checked for the antibiotic susceptibility test. the samples that were collected were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. once dispersed samples were taken and gram staining was done, also they were spread on to a number of freshly prepared agar plates and incubated to allow cells to form microbial colony. results: the result showed microflora common in all types, gram-positive facultative anaerobic rods and cocci. in normal children gram-positive facultative anaerobic and fermenting cocci were predominant where as in children with caries growth of microbiota that were gram-negative and positive, capnophilic, motile and anaerobic rods and cocci belonging to members of genera s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans was seen. conclusion: by the present study it has been concluded that the number of bacteria determined by microscopic counts was twice as high in caries patients as in healthy sites, and  also recommended that amoxicillin, ampicillin and amikacin are the most effective antibacterial drugs for the treatment of dental caries.

TI  == adhesion and biofilm formation by periodontopathogenic bacteria on different commercial brackets.
AB  == aim: to compare early bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation of common and uncommon periodontal pathogens on a variety of commercial brackets in vitro. materials and methods: in vitro adhesion and biofilm formation of 4 bacterial strains on 15 different commercial brackets, in standard culture mediums with and without addition of either serum or human saliva was evaluated by quantitative real time pcr after extraction of bacterial dna. results: materials significantly influenced bacterial adhesiveness in a species-specific way. titanium and gold brackets constantly yielded the lowest values with all tested bacteria and in all tested conditions. bracket materials and medium of growth significantly influenced biofilm formation. conclusion: materials and environmental conditions  significantly influence biofilm formation by periodontal pathogens at the surface of brackets. whenever possible brackets should be kept far from the gingival margin and if this is not possible, brackets made of gold, titanium, and ceramic  should be preferentially used.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == high incidence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans infection in patients with cerebral infarction and diabetic renal failure: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: recent epidemiological studies suggest that periodontitis is a major  risk factor for renal failure and cerebral infarction. the aim of this study was  to evaluate the association among periodontitis, renal failure, and cerebral infarction, focusing on microbiological and immunological features. methods: twenty-one patients treated with hemodialysis (hd) were enrolled in this study. they were 8 with diabetic nephropathy and 13 with non-diabetic nephropathy. blood examination, periodontal examination, brain magnetic resonance image (mri), and dental radiography were performed on all patients. subgingival plaque, saliva, and blood samples were analyzed for the periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), and prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results: we found that the patients with diabetic nephropathy had  more a. actinomycetemcomitans compared with non-diabetic nephropathy (p = 0.038)  in dental plaque. furthermore, the patients with diabetic nephropathy showed a significantly higher incidence of cerebral infarction compared with those with non-diabetic nephropathy (p = 0.029). clinical oral and radiographic scores tended to be higher among patients in the diabetic nephropathy group than in the  non-diabetic nephropathy group. conclusions: periodontal pathogens, particularly  a. actinomycetemcomitans, may play a role, at least a part, in the development of cerebral infarction in japanese hd patients with diabetic nephropathy.

TI  == mir-584 expressed in human gingival epithelial cells is induced by porphyromonas  gingivalis stimulation and regulates interleukin-8 production via lactoferrin receptor.
AB  == background: micrornas (mirnas) are short, non-coding rnas that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. differential mirna expression in innate and acquired immunity has been shown to regulate immune cell development and function. mirna expression has been demonstrated to affect pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. as such, this study explores the role of mirna in the context of pathophysiology  of destructive periodontitis. specifically, this investigation profiles the differentially expressed mirna of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg)-stimulated human  gingival epithelial cells (hgecs). methods: the specific mirnas differentially expressed in pg-stimulated oba-9, immortalized hgecs, were analyzed using microarray. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and western blotting were performed to confirm the level of mirna expression and determine target production of mirna in oba-9. the production of interleukin (il)-8 was measured to determine the bioactivity of target protein regulated by mirna. results: mir-584, which targets lactoferrin receptor (lfr), was 3.39-fold upregulated by pg stimulation. this upregulation of mir-584 was confirmed by real-time pcr. pg stimulation resulted in the suppression of lfr at mrna and protein levels. the transfection of the mir inhibitor for mir-584 in oba-9 recovered pg-induced suppression of lfr. the addition of human lactoferrin (hlf) had a suppressive effect on il-8 production in pg-stimulated oba-9. however, hlf also decreased il-8 production strongly in pg-stimulated oba-9 in the presence of the mir inhibitor for mir-584. conclusion: these findings suggest that the upregulation of mir-584 by pg in oba-9 inhibits the anti-inflammatory effects of hlf via the suppression of lfr.

TI  == anaerobic co-culture of mesenchymal stem cells and anaerobic pathogens - a new in vitro model system.
AB  == background: human mesenchymal stem cells (hmscs) are multipotent by nature and are originally isolated from bone marrow. in light of a future application of hmscs in the oral cavity, a body compartment with varying oxygen partial pressures and an omnipresence of different bacterial species i.e. periodontitis pathogens, we performed this study to gain information about the behavior of hmsc in an anaerobic system and the response in interaction with oral bacterial pathogens. methodology/principal findings: we established a model system with oral pathogenic bacterial species and eukaryotic cells cultured in anaerobic conditions. the facultative anaerobe bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were studied.  their effects on hmscs and primary as well as permanent gingival epithelial cells (ca9-22, hgpec) were comparatively analyzed. we show that hmscs cope with anoxic  conditions, since 40% vital cells remain after 72 h of anaerobic culture. the ca9-22 and hgpec cells are significantly more sensitive to lack of oxygen. all bacterial species reveal a comparatively low adherence to and internalization into hmscs (0.2% and 0.01% of the initial inoculum, respectively). in comparison, the ca9-22 and hgpec cells present better targets for bacterial adherence and internalization. the production of the pro-inflammatory chemokine il-8 is higher  in both gingival epithelial cell lines compared to hmscs and fusobacterium nucleatum induce a time-dependent cytokine secretion in both cell lines. porphyromonas gingivalis is less effective in stimulating secretion of il-8 in the co-cultivation experiments. conclusions/significance: hmscs are suitable for  use in anoxic regions of the oral cavity. the interaction with local pathogenic bacteria does not result in massive pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. the test system established in this study allowed further investigation of parameters prior to set up of oral hmsc in vivo studies.

TI  == anabolic steroids affect human periodontal health and microbiota.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to evaluate periodontal microbiological differences between systemically healthy nonsmoker males taking anabolic androgenic steroids  (aass) and non-aas users and to find associations between disease severity and aas use. methods: ninety-two men practicing bodybuilding were included in the study. they were divided into aas users and a matched control nonuser group and subgrouped based on their most severe periodontal condition. pooled subgingival samples from each individual were cultured to evaluate specific periodontopathogen infection. results: aas users had significantly higher prevalence of severe periodontitis. aas users had greater gingival inflammation and clinical attachment loss of >/= 3 mm than nonusers (odds ratio (or) = 2.4; p  = 0.09; 95 % confidence interval (ci) 0.8-6.4). aas users were 4.9 times more likely to be infected with prevotella intermedia than aas nonusers (or = 4.9; p = 0.003; 95 % ci 1.6-14.7). the or of presenting subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was 8.2 times higher in aas users (or = 8.2; p = 0.03; 95 % ci 0.9-70.8). aas users were 5.6 times more likely to present subgingival candida spp. than nonusers (or = 5.6; p = 0.02; 95 % ci 1.1-27.1). aas users were 14.8 times more likely to present subgingival candida parapsilosis than nonusers (or = 14.8; p < 0.0001; 95 % ci 3.1-69.2). the likelihood of aas users presenting subgingival candida tropicalis was 4.3 times higher than nonusers (or = 4.3; p =  0.03; 95 % ci 1.1-16.9). a. actinomycetemcomitans was mostly isolated in individuals with severe periodontitis and was associated with subgingival porphyromonas gingivalis, p. intermedia, and candida spp. conclusions: aas use may increase the risk for severe periodontitis and may cause a subgingival selection of certain candida species. specific periodontopathogens, such as candida dubliniensis and candida albicans, seem to be negatively affected by aas  use. the higher risk for disease progression in aas users may be explained by the significantly higher proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and candida species as compared to controls. clinical significance: data on the influence of aas on subgingival periodontopathogens and disease progression are scarce. higher proportions of specific periodontopathogens are plausible in aas users. aas users had a higher prevalence of severe periodontitis, gingival inflammation, and clinical attachment loss. men taking aas are at greater risk of periodontitis and specific periodontopathogen infection.

TI  == antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin on bacteria associated with periodontitis  within a biofilm.
AB  == the activity of moxifloxacin was compared with ofloxacin and doxycycline against  bacteria associated with periodontitis within a biofilm (single strain and mixed  population) in vitro. mics and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of moxifloxacin, ofloxacin and doxycyline were determined against single strains and mixed populations in a planktonic state. single-species biofilms of two porphyromonas gingivalis and two aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains and a multispecies biofilm consisting of 12 species were formed for 3 days. the minimal biofilm eradication concentrations (mbecs) were determined after exposing the biofilms to the antibacterials (0.002-512 microg ml(-1)) for 18 h, addition of nutrient broth for 3 days and subsequent subcultivation. photographs were taken using confocal laser-scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.  the mics and mbcs did not differ between ofloxacin and moxifloxacin against a. actinomycetemcomitans, whilst moxifloxacin was more active than the other tested  antibacterials against anaerobes and the mixed population. the single-species biofilms were eradicated by moderate concentrations of the antibacterials, and the lowest mbecs were always found for moxifloxacin (2-8 microg ml(-1)). mbecs against the multispecies biofilms were 128, >512 and >512 microg ml(-1) for moxifloxacin, ofloxacin and doxycycline, respectively. in summary, moxifloxacin in a topical formulation may have potential as an adjunct to mechanical removal of the biofilms.

TI  == acquisition of oral microbes and associated systemic responses of newborn nonhuman primates.
AB  == the acquisition and development of the complex oral microbiome remain ill defined. while selected species of oral bacteria have been examined in relation to their initial colonization in neonates, a more detailed understanding of the dynamics of the microbiome has been developed only in adults. the current investigation used a nonhuman primate model to document the kinetics of colonization of the oral cavities of newborns and infants by a range of oral commensals and pathogens. differences in colonization were evaluated in newborns  from mothers who were maintained on an oral hygiene regimen pre- and postparturition with those displaying naturally acquired gingivitis/periodontitis. the results demonstrate distinct profiles of acquisition of selected oral bacteria, with the transmission of targeted pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, being passed on primarily from mothers with gingivitis/periodontitis. this colonization resulted in defined patterns of systemic antibody responses in the infants. the significant relative risk measures for infection with the pathogens, as well as the relationship of oral infection and blood serum antibody levels, were consistent with those of the newborns from mothers with gingivitis/periodontitis. these findings indicate that the early acquisition of potentially pathogenic oral bacterial species might impact the development of mucosal responses in the gingiva and may provide an enhanced risk for the development of periodontitis later in life.

TI  == prevention of inflammation-mediated bone loss in murine and canine periodontal disease via recruitment of regulatory lymphocytes.
AB  == the hallmark of periodontal disease is the progressive destruction of gingival soft tissue and alveolar bone, which is initiated by inflammation in response to  an invasive and persistent bacterial insult. in recent years, it has become apparent that this tissue destruction is associated with a decrease in local regulatory processes, including a decrease of forkhead box p3-expressing regulatory lymphocytes. accordingly, we developed a controlled release system capable of generating a steady release of a known chemoattractant for regulatory  lymphocytes, c-c motif chemokine ligand 22 (ccl22), composed of a degradable polymer with a proven track record of clinical translation, poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid. we have previously shown that this sustained presentation of ccl22 from a point source effectively recruits regulatory t cells (tregs) to the site of injection. following administration of the treg-recruiting formulation to the gingivae in murine experimental periodontitis, we observed increases in hallmark treg-associated anti-inflammatory molecules, a decrease of  proinflammatory cytokines, and a marked reduction in alveolar bone resorption. furthermore, application of the treg-recruiting formulation (fabricated with human ccl22) in ligature-induced periodontitis in beagle dogs leads to reduced clinical measures of inflammation and less alveolar bone loss under severe inflammatory conditions in the presence of a diverse periodontopathogen milieu.

TI  == microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples compared to that of whole saliva in patients with periodontitis.
AB  == background: the detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. the collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. however, recently, salivary analysis  has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis  because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. the aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with cp and 33 patients with agp. twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. results: all bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as well as actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus/showae, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, eubacterium nodatum, and campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types  of periodontitis. there were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between agp and cp. conclusion: salivary analysis  might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for  microbiologic analysis in both agp and cp.

TI  == oral community interactions of filifactor alocis in vitro.
AB  == filifactor alocis is a gram positive anaerobe that is emerging as an important periodontal pathogen. in the oral cavity f. alocis colonizes polymicrobial biofilm communities; however, little is known regarding the nature of the interactions between f. alocis and other oral biofilm bacteria. here we investigate the community interactions of two strains of f. alocis with streptococcus gordonii, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, organisms with differing pathogenic potential in the oral cavity. in an in vitro community development model, s. gordonii was antagonistic to the accumulation of f. alocis into a dual species community. in contrast, f. nucleatum and the type strain of f. alocis formed a synergistic partnership. accumulation of a low passage isolate of f. alocis was also enhanced by f. nucleatum. in three species communities of s. gordonii, f. nucleatum and f. alocis, the antagonistic effects of s. gordonii superseded the synergistic effects of f. nucleatum toward f. alocis. the interaction between a.  actinomycetemcomitans and f. alocis was strain specific and a. actinomycetemcomitans could either stimulate f. alocis accumulation or have no effect depending on the strain. p. gingivalis and f. alocis formed heterotypic communities with the amount of p. gingivalis greater than in the absence of f. alocis. however, while p. gingivalis benefited from the relationship, levels of f. alocis in the dual species community were lower compared to f. alocis alone. the inhibitory effect of p. gingivalis toward f. alocis was dependent, at least partially, on the presence of the mfa1 fimbrial subunit. in addition, ai-2 production by p. gingivalis helped maintain levels of f. alocis. collectively, these results show that the pattern of f. alocis colonization will be dictated by the spatial composition of microbial microenvironments, and that the organism may preferentially accumulate at sites rich in f. nucleatum.

TI  == micrornas responsive to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis lps modulate expression of genes regulating innate immunity in human macrophages.
AB  == micrornas (mirnas) are a class of small, noncoding rnas that regulate post-transcriptional expression of their respective target genes and are responsive to various stimuli, including lps. here we examined the early (4 h) mirna responses of thp1-differentiated macrophages challenged with lps derived from the periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis or environmentally-modified lps obtained from p. gingivalis grown in cigarette smoke extract. predicted mirna-gene target interactions for lps-responsive mir-29b and let-7f were confirmed using dual-luciferase assays and by transfection experiments using mirna mimics and inhibitors. convergent and divergent mirna profiles were observed in treated samples where differences in mirna levels related to the type, concentration and  incubation times of lps challenge. dual-luciferase experiments revealed mir-29b targeting of interleukin-6 receptoralpha (il-6ralpha) and ifn-gamma inducible protein 30 and let-7f targeting of suppressor of cytokine signaling 4 and thrombospondin-1. transfection experiments confirmed mir-29b and let-7f modulation of il-6ralpha and socs4 protein expression levels, respectively. thus, we have demonstrated convergent/divergent mirna responses to wild type lps and its environmentally-modified lps, and demonstrate mirna targeting of key genes linked to inflammation and immunity. our data indicate that these lps-responsive  mirnas may play a key role in fine-tuning the host response to periodontal pathogens.

TI  == detection of putative periodontopathic bacteria in type 1 diabetic and healthy children: a comparative study.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to compare and assess the risk of periodontitis due to the presence of four putative periodontopathic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) in type 1 diabetic and healthy children. materials and methods: fifty type 1 diabetic and 50 healthy children in the age group of 7-14 years were recruited for the study. subgingival plaque samples collected from permanent first molars were subjected to polymerase chain reaction assay to detect 16s rrna gene of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola and a. actinomycetemcomitans. the data were analyzed using fisher exact test. the p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. results: the prevalence of subgingival periodontal pathogens in diabetic and healthy children was 2% and 4%  for p. gingivalis, 34% and 34% for t. denticola, 20% and 18% for a. actinomycetemcomitans and for t. forsythia, 4% and 34%, respectively. significant statistical difference was not observed with regard to the prevalence of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and a. actinomycetemcomitans among type 1 diabetic and  healthy children (p = 1.00). conversely, t. forsythia was less prevalent in diabetic children compared to healthy children. conclusion: statistical significance was not observed for the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in  type 1 diabetic subjects. the results of the present study thus reveal the absence of risk of periodontitis by these bacterial species in type 1 diabetic subjects.

TI  == effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy on periodontally infected tooth sockets in rats.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) in alveolar treatment of areas with induced periodontitis. thirty male wistar rats were subjected to ligature-induced periodontal disease (pd) in the first left inferior molars, while the right side  molars did not receive ligatures. after 7 days of pd evolution, ligatures were removed from the left side, and the first left and right mandibular molars were extracted. afterwards, animals were divided into groups according to the following treatments: control (c)--no treatment; mechanical debridement (md)--mechanical debridement and irrigation with saline solution; and apdt--mechanical debridement, irrigation with toluidine blue o (tbo), and 1 min of laser irradiation (gaalas, 660 nm, 30 mw, 32 j/cm(2), 60 s). ligatures were removed and samples of the alveolar content after extraction and after each treatment were collected for microbial processing by real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola. data were submitted to statistical analysis by multiple comparison tests (mcnemar test; p < 0.05). t. denticola was not found in the collected samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were found in ligature samples. tooth socket samples without periodontitis induction presented lesser microbial charge than samples with induced periodontitis (p < 0.05). apdt significantly reduced a. actinomycetemcomitans levels on the left side (p < 0.05). it was concluded that apdt was an effective antimicrobial treatment for tooth sockets in areas affected by induced periodontitis.

TI  == molecular microbiological evaluation of subgingival biofilm sampling by paper point and curette.
AB  == the present clinical study aimed to investigate if there are differences in microbiological outcomes dependent on the subgingival biofilm collection method.  subgingival biofilm samples were collected from the four deepest pockets (>5 mm)  of 17 patients with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and 33 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), first by paper point and thereafter by curette. samples obtained with the same method were pooled together from each patient and forwarded for molecular microbiological analysis by a commercially available assay (iai pado test 4.5) that estimates total bacterial load and levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. data analysis included frequency of detection, quantification and correlation of detection levels between the two sampling methods. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola were detected in >90% of the samples, and their detection levels exhibited a strong correlation between sampling methods. the detection consistency of a. actinomycetemcomitans was 56% between the two sampling methods. a. actinomycetemcomitans was more readily detected by paper point compared with curette collection with a stronger  correlation between the two methods in agp. subgingival biofilm sampling by curette or paper point does not yield differences in the detection of the three 'red complex' species. however, a. actinomycetemcomitans was more consistently detected by means of paper point collection, which can be crucial in the decision to administer antibiotics as an adjunctive periodontal treatment.

TI  == green tea extract as a local drug therapy on periodontitis patients with diabetes mellitus: a randomized case-control study.
AB  == background: the green tea extract is a naturally occurring product having beneficial effects that counteract with the pathobiological features of periodontitis and diabetes mellitus. hence, the present study was aimed at incorporation of green tea extract into hydroxylpropyl methylcellulose and investigates its efficacy in chronic periodontitis patients associated with and without diabetes mellitus. materials and methods: for the in vitro study, formulation of green tea strips and placebo strips, and analysis of drug release  pattern from the green tea strips at different time intervals were performed. for the in vivo study, 50 patients (20-65 years), including 25 systemically healthy patients with chronic periodontitis (group 1) and 25 diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis (group 2) were enrolled. in each patient, test and control  sites were identified for the placement of green tea and placebo strips, respectively. gingival index (gi), probing pocket depth (ppd), and clinical attachment level (cal) were examined at baseline, first, second, third, and fourth weeks. microbiological analysis for porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was performed at baseline and fourth week.  results: the in vitro study showed 10.67% green tea release at 30 min; thereafter, a slow release was noted till 120 min. in vivo study: both groups showed significant reduction in gi scores at the test sites. group 1 showed significant (p < 0.001) ppd reduction at different time intervals at the test sites. however, group 2 showed significant reduction from baseline (5.30 +/- 0.70) to fourth week (3.5 +/- 0.97). statistically significant gain in cal at the test sites was observed both in group 1 (1.33 mm) and group 2 (1.43 mm). the prevalence of p. gingivalis in group 1 test sites was significantly reduced from  baseline (75%) to fourth week (25%). conclusions: local drug delivery using green tea extract could be used as an adjunct in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

TI  == occurrence of red complex microorganisms and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in patients with diabetes.
AB  == aim: the aim of the present study was to analyze the occurrence of porphyromonas  gingivalis (p. gingivalis), tannerella forsythia (t. forsythia), treponema denticola (t. denticola), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) in patients with diabetes. methods: periodontal and diabetic parameters and subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 60 patients with diabetes and 62 patients without diabetes. by using polymerase chain reaction, the prevalence of red complex microorganisms (p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola) and a. actinomycetemcomitans were determined. descriptive and non-parametric statistical analyses between groups were performed (kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney u-test, and fisher's exact test). results: patients with diabetes presented significantly higher periodontal attachment loss levels compared to patients without diabetes. red complex microorganisms were detected in lower frequencies in patients with diabetes. the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans was higher in patients with diabetes and periodontitis compared to systemically-healthy patients without periodontitis (p < 0.05). p. gingivalis was associated with periodontitis in non-diabetic patients (p < 0.05), whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with periodontitis in diabetic patients (p < 0.05). conclusions: the findings of the present study indicate that there might be differences in the subgingival microbiota between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. in addition, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were associated with periodontitis in patients without diabetes and patients with diabetes, respectively.

TI  == quantification of key periodontal pathogens in insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic  and non-diabetic patients with generalized chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is a common problem in patients with diabetes mellitus (dm), however, differences in the putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with dm compared to non-dm subjects are still inconclusive. the red complex, which includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, encompasses the most important pathogens in adult periodontal disease. the aim of the present study was to compare cell numbers of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, t.  forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in gingival sulcus of healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis sites of non-diabetes mellitus (ndm), controlled and poorly controlled insulin-dependent dm (cdm and pdm) patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were collected from 19 cdm, 19 pdm and 19 ndm patients. taqman real time-pcr was used to determine bacterial cell number. at subject level, the quantity of red complex bacteria was significantly higher in pdm than those of ndm and positively correlated with hba1c. at site level (total 342 sites), cell numbers of t. denticola and t. forsythia in healthy sites of cdm and pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm. in gingivitis sites, the numbers of p. gingivalis in cdm and pdm and t. forsythia in pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm while in periodontitis sites, higher quantity of p. gingivalis in pdm was observed. our study indicated that poor glycemic control is associated with increasing cell numbers of red complex bacteria in subgingival biofilm.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

TI  == effects of chitosan particles in periodontal pathogens and gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == chitosan is a naturally derived polymer with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory  properties. however, studies evaluating the role of chitosan in the control of periodontal pathogens and the responses of fibroblasts to inflammatory stimuli are lacking. in the present study, we analyzed whether chitosan particles may inhibit the growth of periodontal pathogens and modulate the inflammatory response in human gingival fibroblasts. chitosan particles were generated through ionic gelation. they inhibited the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans at 5 mg/ml. conversely, il-1beta strongly stimulated pge2 protein levels in gingival fibroblasts, and chitosan inhibited this response at 50 microg/ml. il-1beta-stimulated pge2 production was dependent  on the jnk pathway, and chitosan strongly inhibited this response. il-1beta stimulated nf-kappab activation, another signaling pathway involved in pge2 production. however, chitosan particles were unable to modify nf-kappab signaling. the present study shows that chitosan exerts a predominantly anti-inflammatory activity by modulating pge2 levels through the jnk pathway, which may be useful in the prevention or treatment of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == effect of photoactivated disinfection with a light-emitting diode on bacterial species and biofilms associated with periodontitis and peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: to determine the effect of photoactivated disinfection (pad) using toluidine blue and a light-emitting diode (led) in the red spectrum (wave length  at 625-635 nm) on species associated with periodontitis and peri-implantitis and  bacteria within a periodontopathic biofilm. methods: sixteen single microbial species including 2 porphyromonas gingivalis and 2 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and a multispecies mixture consisting of 12 species suspended in saline without and with 25% human serum were exposed to pad. moreover, single-species biofilms consisting of 2 p. gingivalis and 2 a. actinomycetemcomitans strains and a multi-species biofilm on 24-well-plates, grown on titanium discs and in artificial periodontal pockets were exposed to pad with and without pretreatment with 0.25% hydrogen peroxide. changes in the viability were determined by counting the colony forming units (cfu). results: pad reduced the cfu counts in saline by 1.42 log(1)(0) after led application for  30s and by 1.99 log(1)(0) after led application for 60s compared with negative controls (each p<0.001). serum did not inhibit the efficacy of pad. pad reduced statistically significantly (p<0.05) the cfu counts of the p. gingivalis biofilms. the viability of the a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms and the multi-species biofilms was statistically significantly decreased when pad was applied after a pretreatment with 0.25% hydrogen peroxide. the biofilm formed in  artificial pockets was more sensitive to pad with and without pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide compared with those formed on titanium discs. conclusions: pad  using a led was effective against periodontopathic bacterial species and reduced  viability in biofilms but was not able to completely destroy complex biofilms. the use of pad following pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide resulted in an additional increase in the antimicrobial activity which may represent a new alternative to treat periodontal and peri-implant infections thus warranting further testing in clinical studies.

TI  == clinical evaluation of salivary periodontal pathogen levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in patients before dental implant treatment.
AB  == objective: periodontal pathogens in dental plaque are the main causative agents of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. detection of the presence of such periodontal pathogens early would serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the periodontal pathogen levels in saliva were correlated with the periodontal status of patients receiving implant treatment. materials and methods: a total of 291 patients visiting tokyo dental college chiba hospital were divided into four groups: a no-periodontitis (np) group, a mild-periodontitis (mip) group, a moderate-periodontitis (mop) group, and a severe-periodontitis (sp) group. the levels of the following five periodontal pathogens in saliva were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: the levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were significantly higher in mop group than in np  group (p < 0.05). the levels of all periodontal pathogens tested except a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in sp group than in np group (p < 0.05). conclusion: the detection levels of the periodontal pathogens targeted in  saliva samples were correlated with the periodontal status. this suggests that using saliva to screen for periodontopathic bacteria offers an easier-to-use clinical tool than the paper point method in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis.

TI  == periodontopathogen profile of healthy and oral lichen planus patients with gingivitis or periodontitis.
AB  == oral lichen planus (olp) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently detected in oral tissues. the aim of our study was to identify the prevalence of  the detection of periodontopathogenic microorganisms (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in olp patients and to compare with  this prevalence of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in healthy non-olp patients. our study included 27 (18 chronic periodontitis (olpp) and 9 gingivitis (olpg)) patients diagnosed with olp along with 26 (13 chronic periodontitis (hp)  and 13 gingivitis (hg)) healthy non-olp patients. the multiplex polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization method (micro-ident) was used for identifying periodontopathogenic microorganisms present in subgingival plaque samples. the percentages of detection for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples taken from olp patients (olpg and olpp) were 18.5%, 85.1%, 81.4%, 88.8% and 74%, respectively. meanwhile, in the non-olp patients (hg and hp), these values were 7.6%, 50%, 46.1%, 73% and 57.7%, respectively. thus, comparing the non-olp groups with the olp groups, the periodontopathogens' percentages of detection in the olp groups were higher than those in the non-olp groups. according to our study results, olp patients have higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola than non-olp patients. we argue that the high percentages in patients with olp may help identify the importance of periodontopathogenic microorganisms  in the progress of periodontal diseases of olp.

TI  == a randomized controlled clinical trial on the clinical and microbiological efficacy of systemic satranidazole in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: the present clinical trial was designed to investigate the effectiveness of systemic satranidazole (sz) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. methods: sixty-six subjects presenting with at least twelve teeth with probing depth (pd) > or = 4 mm were selected. thirty-three subjects were randomly assigned to full-mouth srp  + placebo (group 1) and 33 subjects were assigned to full-mouth srp + sz (group 2). the clinical outcomes evaluated were plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi),  clinical attachment level (cal) and pd at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. also, microbial analysis of dental plaque using polymerase chain reaction was done at baseline, 3 and 6 months to estimate the number of sites harboring periodontopathogens. results: sixty subjects were evaluated up to 6 months. at 6  months, group 2 showed greater mean reduction (3.84 +/- 1.31 mm) in pd as compared to group 1 (1.42 +/- 1.01 mm; p < 0.05) and there was a greater mean cal gain (3.22 +/- 1.01 mm) in group 2 as compared to group 1 (1.15 +/- 1.49 mm; p <  0.05). these subjects also showed significant reductions in the number of certain periodontopathogens, such as tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: the systemic use of sz, when used as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy in subjects with periodontitis, achieves significantly better clinical and microbiological results than scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == oxidative stress and antibody levels to periodontal bacteria in adults: the nagasaki islands study.
AB  == objective: periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the tissues supporting the teeth and is caused by subgingival plaque. systemic increases in reactive oxygen species are involved in pathogenesis of periodontitis. this study addressed the relationship between levels of serum oxidative stress and antibodies against putative periodontopathic bacteria and their association with  periodontal conditions, in a community-based study. subjects and methods: serum samples were measured for reactive oxygen metabolite (rom) levels and anti-oxidant capacity. the serum levels of immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and eikenella corrodens (ec) were determined by elisa. results: the participants with greater clinical attachment loss had higher serum rom levels and igg antibody titers to pg. serum rom levels were positively  correlated with antibody titers to pg, pi, and ec. when the participants with greater probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss were used as the dependent variables, high rom levels showed a statistically significant associations in multivariate logistic analyses; the adjusted odds ratios were 2.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.0-8.5) and 6.0 (95% confidence interval = 2.0-17.6), respectively. conclusions: it was concluded that an increased oxidative stress may be detrimental to periodontitis in japanese community-dwelling adults.

TI  == phototoxic effect of blue light on the planktonic and biofilm state of anaerobic  periodontal pathogens.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to compare the phototoxic effects of blue  light exposure on periodontal pathogens in both planktonic and biofilm cultures.  methods: strains of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis, in planktonic or biofilm states, were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400.520 nm. a quartz-tungsten-halogen  lamp at a power density of 500 mw/cm(2) was used for the light source. each sample was exposed to 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 seconds of each bacterial strain in  the planktonic or biofilm state. confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm) was used to observe the distribution of live/dead bacterial cells in biofilms. after  light exposure, the bacterial killing rates were calculated from colony forming unit (cfu) counts. results: clsm images that were obtained from biofilms showed a mixture of dead and live bacterial cells extending to a depth of 30-45 microm. obvious differences in the live-to-dead bacterial cell ratio were found in p. gingivalis biofilm according to light exposure time. in the planktonic state, almost all bacteria were killed with 60 seconds of light exposure to f. nucleatum (99.1%) and with 15 seconds to p. gingivalis (100%). in the biofilm state, however, only the cfu of p. gingivalis demonstrated a decreasing tendency with increasing light exposure time, and there was a lower efficacy of phototoxicity to p. gingivalis as biofilm than in the planktonic state. conclusions: blue light exposure using a dental halogen curing unit is effective in reducing periodontal  pathogens in the planktonic state. it is recommended that an adjunctive exogenous photosensitizer be used and that pathogens be exposed to visible light for clinical antimicrobial periodontal therapy.

TI  == periodontopathogen and epstein-barr virus-associated periapical periodontitis may be the source of retrograde infectious peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a role in periodontitis and  peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. periapical periodontitis (pp) lesions can predict future apical peri-implantitis complications. purpose: this pilot study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial coinfection in symptomatic (sp) and asymptomatic (ap) pp and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination in patients receiving implants. materials and methods: polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification was performed on pp granulation tissue  (gt) from 33 sp and ap patients and compared with unstimulated whole saliva. quantitative pcr evaluated epstein-barr virus (ebv) and cytomegalovirus copy counts. results: sp gt had higher proportions of periodontopathogens. symptomatic patients were 3.7 times more likely to be infected with ebv than ap (p = .07; 95% ci: 0.8-16.2). sp were 2.9, 2.1, 3.6, and 1.6 times more likely to be infected with treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the odds ratio of ebv infecting pp lesions was two times higher in those positive for the virus  in saliva. saliva tannerella forsythia-positive patients were 15 times more likely to present this pathogen in pp lesions (p = .038). saliva ebv-positive individuals were 7 and 3.5 times more likely to yield gt contamination with t. forsythia and t. denticola, respectively. ebv copy counts were significantly higher in sp (p < .01). conclusions: a causal association between ebv, specific bacterial anaerobic infection, and symptomatic pp is likely. ebv high prevalence  underscores the viral etiological importance. salivary ebv contamination is likely to be associated with viral and bacterial gt infection. saliva pcr analysis can be a good predictor of gt specific infection and help establish antimicrobial therapy. if confirmed by prospective longitudinal clinical trials,  antiviral therapy could possibly benefit sp and nonresponsive to treatment individuals and help prevent potential peri-implant infectious complications.

TI  == no evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  == background and objective: there is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (tcs)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to tcs toothpaste. therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to tcs in toothpaste selects for tcs-resistant bacteria within the oral  biofilm. material and methods: dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. participants had been randomly assigned to use tcs (3000 mug/ml tcs) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n  = 22). diluted plaque samples were plated on to wilkins-chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and tcs (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees c under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing and tcs minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined for each isolate. results: at 3000 mug/ml tcs no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. the mics of tcs for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/ml in both groups. species common to both groups had similar mics. veillonella parvula and campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar mics in both groups. conclusion: the use of tcs-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in mic of tcs of oral bacterial isolates.

TI  == soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (strem-1) in gingival crevicular fluid: association with clinical and microbiologic parameters.
AB  == background: soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (strem-1) belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in amplification of the inflammatory response to bacterial infection. this cross-sectional study aims to  investigate the levels of strem-1 in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) of individuals without periodontitis and with chronic periodontitis (cp) or generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and their association with the levels of key periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. methods: gcf and subgingival  plaque samples were obtained from healthy sites of participants without periodontitis (n = 20) and periodontitis sites of patients with cp (n = 22) and gagp (n = 20). strem-1 levels in gcf were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans levels in subgingival plaque were analyzed  by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: strem-1 levels in gcf were higher in cp and gagp than healthy sites by 3.6- and 4.4-fold, respectively, with no significant differences between the two forms of periodontitis. moreover, strem-1 levels in gcf were positively correlated with site-specific clinical periodontal parameters and levels of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, but not a. actinomycetemcomitans, in subgingival plaque. conclusion: increased gcf levels of strem-1 at diseased sites and their positive correlation with clinical and microbiologic parameters strengthen the association of this inflammatory marker with periodontitis.

TI  == the microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  == background: oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants  and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. materials and methods: twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. the samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures.  in order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. the colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. alterations in the  presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using  analysis of variance (anova) with tukey's test post hoc. results: the average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. the bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. conclusion: the anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number  of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.

TI  == combining salivary pathogen and serum antibody levels improves their diagnostic ability in detection of periodontitis.
AB  == background: initiation and progression of periodontitis correlates with increased quantities of periodontitis-associated bacteria in periodontal biofilms. in the present study, the aim is to measure aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis amounts in saliva and their antibody (immunoglobulin [ig]a and igg) levels in serum and evaluate their diagnostic abilities, together  or alone, in chronic periodontitis. methods: the study population comprised 230 finnish dentate adults: 84 with generalized chronic periodontitis (gcp), 65 with  localized chronic periodontitis (lcp), and 81 controls without periodontitis. general and oral health information was obtained by questionnaires, interviews, and clinical and radiographic examinations. salivary and serum samples were analyzed by quantitative single copy gene-based real-time polymerase chain reaction and multiserotype enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. results: pathogen carriers suffered mostly from gcp and seldom from lcp. a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis quantities in saliva were strongly associated with corresponding serum iga and igg values (p <0.001) and with severity of disease (p <0.001). p. gingivalis exhibited more straightforward associations among salivary bacterial burdens, corresponding antibody formation,  and periodontitis severity than a. actinomycetemcomitans. the combination of information on age, sex, smoking, and p. gingivalis results provided an area under the curve of 0.817 (95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.87, p <0.001) for gcp. conclusion: the combination of saliva p. gingivalis quantity with pathogen-specific host response may be used to diagnose periodontitis with high accuracy.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens in amniotic fluid and the role of periodontal disease in pre-term birth and low birth weight.
AB  == background: pre-term birth and/or low birth weight (ptlbw) is a serious problem in developing countries. the absence of known risk factors in approximately 50% of ptlbw cases has resulted in a continued search for other causes. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of periodontitis on pregnancy outcomes. methods: samples were taken from 50 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis. polymerase chain reaction was performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained during amniocentesis and on subgingival plaque samples to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia,  campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens. plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were evaluated.  medical records were obtained after birth. results: social and demographic variables were similar among the gingivitis (g), localized periodontitis (lp) and generalized periodontitis (gp) groups. four subjects gave birth to ptlbw neonates. campylobacter rectus, t. forsythia, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were detected in the amniotic fluid and subgingival plaque samples of three patients who gave birth to ptlbw neonates. the amniotic fluid sample from the fourth patient was not positive for any of the tested pathogens. conclusion: these findings suggest that the transmission of some periodontal pathogens from the oral cavity of the mother may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. the results contribute to an understanding of the association between periodontal disease and ptlbw, but further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == magnolol ameliorates ligature-induced periodontitis in rats and osteoclastogenesis: in vivo and in vitro study.
AB  == periodontal disease characterized by alveolar bone resorption and bacterial pathogen-evoked inflammatory response has been believed to have an important impact on human oral health. the aim of this study was to evaluate whether magnolol, a main constituent of magnolia officinalis, could inhibit the pathological features in ligature-induced periodontitis in rats and osteoclastogenesis. the sterile, 3-0 (diameter; 0.2 mm) black braided silk thread, was placed around the cervix of the upper second molars bilaterally and knotted medially to induce periodontitis. the morphological changes around the ligated molars and alveolar bone were examined by micro-ct. the distances between the amelocemental junction and the alveolar crest of the upper second molars bilaterally were measured to evaluate the alveolar bone loss. administration of magnolol (100 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly inhibited alveolar bone resorption, the  number of osteoclasts on bony surface, and protein expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor- kappa b ligand (rankl), a key mediator promoting osteoclast differentiation, in ligated rats. moreover, the ligature-induced neutrophil infiltration, expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-1 and mmp-9, superoxide formation, and nuclear factor- kappa b activation in inflamed gingival tissues were all attenuated by magnolol. in the in vitro study, magnolol also inhibited the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  that are key pathogens initiating periodontal disease. furthermore, magnolol dose dependently reduced rankl-induced osteoclast differentiation from raw264.7 macrophages, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (trap) activity of differentiated cells accompanied by a significant attenuation of resorption pit area caused by osteoclasts. collectively, we demonstrated for the first time that magnolol significantly ameliorates the alveolar bone loss in ligature-induced experimental periodontitis by suppressing periodontopathic microorganism accumulation, nf- kappa b-mediated inflammatory mediator synthesis, rankl formation, and osteoclastogenesis. these activities support that magnolol is a potential agent to treat periodontal disease.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans associates with the risk of coronary artery disease.
AB  == aim: we investigated the association between angiographically verified coronary artery disease (cad) and subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. materials and methods: the cross-sectional study population (n = 445) comprised 171 (38.4%) patients with stable cad, 158 (35.5%) with acute coronary syndrome (acs) and 116  (26.1%) with no significant cad (no cad). all patients participated in clinical and radiological oral health examinations. pooled subgingival bacterial samples were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assays. results: in all study groups, the presence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola indicated a  significant (p </= 0.001) linear association with the extent of alveolar bone loss (abl), but a. actinomycetemcomitans did not (p = 0.074). with a threshold level of bacterial cells 1 x 10(5) a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent in the stable cad group (42.1%) compared to the no cad group (30.2%) (p = 0.040). in a multi-adjusted logistic regression analysis using this  threshold, a. actinomycetemcomitans positivity associated with stable cad (or 1.83, 95% ci 1.00-3.35, p = 0.049), but its level or levels of other bacteria did not. conclusions: the presence of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans associates with an almost twofold risk of stable cad independently of alveolar bone loss.

TI  == peptides: beta-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds as highly effective antimicrobial and anti-epithelial proliferation agents.
AB  == background: the use of antimicrobial peptides (amps) as therapeutic agents for periodontal infections has great advantages, such as broad spectrum of action, low toxicity, and limited bacterial resistance. however, their practical use is limited because of the large amount of peptide required to exercise the microbicidal function. methods: lyetxi, ll37f, and kr12 cationic peptides were prepared with beta-cyclodextrin (betacd) at 1:1 molar ratios. the susceptibility  of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum were assessed in anaerobic conditions. cytotoxicity assays were performed using osteoblast and caco-2 epithelial cells, and hemolytic activity was assessed on rabbit erythrocytes at an absorbance of 414 nm. parameters of surface roughness and electrical charge were established by atomic  force microscopy and zeta (zeta) potential, respectively. results: amp/betacds drastically decreased the peptide concentration required for activity against the bacteria tested. moreover, amps associated with betacd were able to modify cell-surface parameters, such as roughness and zeta potential. on the other hand, amp/betacd did not alter the degree of hemolysis induced by the pure amps. the effective concentration at half-maximum values of the peptides and compounds on osteoblasts were greater than the concentrations required to achieve inhibition of bacterial growth in all the species tested. amp/betacds inhibited the proliferation of caco-2 epithelial cells in a more efficient manner than amps alone. conclusion: amp/betacd compounds more effectively inhibit periodontopathogenic bacteria than amps alone, with the additional ability of inhibiting the proliferation of epithelial cells at concentrations that are non-cytotoxic for osteoblasts and erythrocytes.

TI  == subgingival bacterial burden in relation to clinical and radiographic periodontal parameters.
AB  == background: this cross-sectional study characterizes the association between subgingival bacterial profile and periodontal parameters in patients assigned to  coronary angiography because of cardiologic problems, which may affect the oral microbiota. methods: pooled subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 477 dentate individuals during the oral examinations, along with periodontal probing  depth (pd) and assessments of bleeding on probing (bop) and radiographic alveolar bone loss (abl). the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay was used to determine the levels of 29 oral bacteria, which were divided into three bacterial complexes. results: all bacterial combinations from the etiologic bacterial group and each species from the red complex were significantly associated (p <0.001) with grade of abl. the prevalence of the etiologic bacterial group and the level  of each species were also associated strongly with the proportion of sites with pd 4 to 5 mm and >/= 6 mm, bop, and abl, except aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. levels of gram-negative oral bacteria correlated significantly with those of gram-positive species (r = 0.840, p <0.001). in multiple logistic regression analysis, the prevalence of the etiologic bacterial  group, levels of gram-negative bacteria and treponema denticola, and the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola associated significantly  with abl, whereas other bacterial complexes and levels of gram-positive species did not. conclusions: although levels of gram-negative and -positive species paralleled periodontal parameters, only the species considered etiologic were associated with abl.

TI  == assessment of viable periodontal pathogens by reverse transcription quantitative  polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: molecular biological methods for the detection of periodontitis-associated bacteria based on dna amplification have many advantages over classical culture techniques. however, when it comes to assessing immediate  therapeutic success, e.g. reduction of viable bacteria, dna-based polymerase chain reaction is unsuitable because it does not distinguish between live and dead bacteria. our objective was to establish a simple rna-based method that is easily set up and allows reliable assessment of the live bacterial load. material and methods: we compared conventional quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr), propidium monoazide-qpcr and reverse transcription qpcr (rt-qpcr) for the detection of periodontal pathogens after antibiotic treatment in vitro. applicability was tested using clinical samples of subgingival plaque obtained from patients at different treatment stages. results: the bacterial load was remarkably stable over prolonged periods when assessed by conventional qpcr, while both propidium monoazide intercalation as well as cdna quantitation showed  a decline according to decreasing numbers of viable bacteria after antibiotic treatment. clinical samples of subgingival plaque were directly subjected to dnase i treatment and rt without previous extraction or purification steps. while the results of the dna- and rna-based methods are comparable in untreated patients, the classical qpcr frequently detected substantial bacterial load in treated patients where rt-qpcr no longer indicates the presence of those pathogens. the disagreement rates ranged between 4 and 20% in first visit patients and 8-50% in the group of currently treated patients. conclusion: we propose to use rna-based detection methods to verify the successful eradication of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == the anti-phospholipid antibody-dependent and independent effects of periodontopathic bacteria on threatened preterm labor and preterm birth.
AB  == purpose: periodontal disease is considered to be a risk factor for threatened preterm labor (tpl) and preterm birth (pb), but pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. we hypothesized that infection with periodontopathic bacteria may enhance thrombosis through molecular mimicry with tlrvyk peptides on beta-2 glycoprotein i, a target molecule in anti-phospholipid syndrome. this study aimed to examine the effects of periodontitis on tpl and pb. methods: ninety-five pregnant women (47 tpl and 48 healthy subjects) participated. periodontal clinical parameters and periodontopathic bacteria were examined. molecular mimicry between tlrvyk peptides and homologous peptides on the periodontopathic bacteria was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the respective peptides (sirvyk on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tlriyt on porphyromonus gingivalis, and tlalyk on treponema denticola). serum high-sensitivity c-reactive protein, anti-tlrvyk and anti-sirvyk igg antibodies were measured using elisa. results: among the rabbit antibodies specific for the bacterial homologous peptides, only anti-sirvyk igg antibody reacted with tlrvyk peptides. multivariable analysis showed that anti-sirvyk igg antibody was significantly associated with diagnosis of tpl. of 95 births, 14 (14.7 %) delivered preterm. the preterm birth rate was higher in the anti-sirvyk igg antibody >median group than in the </=median group. of the 47 tpl subjects 13 had pb, and ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that past smoking, presence of p. gingivalis and anti-sirvyk igg antibody were significantly correlated with pb. conclusions: infection with p. gingivalis and the antibody response to sirvyk might be associated with tpl and pb.

TI  == activation of invariant nk t cells in periodontitis lesions.
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most prevalent human inflammatory diseases. the major clinical phenotypes of this polymicrobial, biofilm-mediated disease are chronic and aggressive periodontitis, the latter being characterized by a rapid course of destruction that is generally attributed to an altered immune-inflammatory response against periodontal pathogens. still, the biological basis for the pathophysiological distinction of the two disease categories has not been well documented yet. type i nkt cells are a lymphocyte subset with important roles in  regulating immune responses to either tolerance or immunity, including immune responses against bacterial pathogens. in this study, we delineate the mechanisms of nkt cell activation in periodontal infections. we show an infiltration of type i nkt cells in aggressive, but not chronic, periodontitis lesions in vivo. murine dendritic cells infected with aggressive periodontitis-associated aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans triggered a type i ifn response followed by type i nkt cell activation. in contrast, infection with porphyromonas gingivalis, a principal pathogen in chronic periodontitis, did not induce nkt cell activation. this difference could be explained by the absence of a type i ifn response to p. gingivalis infection. we found these ifns to be critical for nkt cell activation. our study provides a conceivable biological distinction between the two periodontitis subforms and identifies factors required for the activation of the  immune system in response to periodontal bacteria.

TI  == bacterial adhesion and colonization differences between zirconia and titanium implant abutments: an in vivo human study.
AB  == purpose: several parameters have been described for determining the success or failure of dental implants. the surface properties of transgingival implant components have had a great impact on the long-term success of dental implants. the purpose of this study was to compare the tendency of two periodontal pathogens to adhere to and colonize zirconia abutments and titanium alloys both in hard surfaces and soft tissues. methods: twelve patients participated in this  study. three months after implant placement, the abutments were connected. five weeks following the abutment connections, the abutments were removed, probing depth measurements were recorded, and gingival biopsies were performed. the abutments and gingival biopsies taken from the buccal gingiva were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction to compare the dna copy numbers of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and total bacteria. the surface free energy of the abutments was calculated using the sessile water drop method before replacement. data analyses used the mann whitney u-test, and p-values below 0.05 find statistical significance. results: the present study showed no statistically significant differences between the dna copy numbers of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and total bacteria for both the titanium and zirconia abutments and the biopsies taken from their buccal gingiva. the differences between the free surface energy of the abutments had no  influence on the microbiological findings. conclusions: zirconia surfaces have comparable properties to titanium alloy surfaces and may be suitable and safe materials for the long-term success of dental implants.

AB  == purpose: the effect of gingival coverage by removable partial dentures (rpds) on  bacterial accumulation has not been sufficiently established. the aim of this study was to evaluate the periodontal and microbiologic reactions to mandibular major connectors. it was hypothesized that the use of a lingual plate increases the risk of periodontal disease. materials and methods: fourteen subjects (mean age: 69.0 years) received oral hygiene instructions and ultrasonic debridement prior to examination. each subject received an experimental rpd incorporating either a lingual bar or lingual plate for the first 8 weeks and was then switched to the other option for the next 8 weeks. clinical parameters (plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, and tooth mobility) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the periodontal pocket in the test site to measure the colonization of periodontal pathogens after the use of each denture.  results: the mean probing depth was significantly greater after use of the lingual plate compared to the lingual bar (p < .05), whereas the type of connector did not affect the levels of any of the microbial species. all subjects that exhibited at least one bacterial species showed smaller numbers of microorganisms at the second examination than at the first. conclusions: the lingual cervical coverage did not precipitate the accumulation of anaerobic microorganisms, although it could potentially induce gingival inflammation. the results suggest that a lingual plate can be used as safely as a lingual bar if oral and denture hygiene are carefully monitored.

TI  == aetiology, microbiology and therapy of periapical lesions around oral implants: a retrospective analysis.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was: (i) to evaluate whether an endodontic pathology on the extracted tooth or adjacent teeth of an implant site has an influence on the emergence of a periapical lesion, (ii) to retrospectively analyse the outcome of different treatment strategies, (iii) to determine which bacteria were present in periapical lesions. methods: the endodontic status of the tooth at the implant site and the adjacent teeth was explored and linked to the periapical status of the implant. for all the lesions treated since 2000, their survival was assessed. finally, microbial samples (culturing) from the periapical lesions, were analysed. results: if an endodontic treatment or a periapical lesion at the apex of a tooth is present, a periapical lesion around the implant can be detected in 8.2% up to 13.6% (or 7.2). for periapical pathology at the adjacent teeth, the percentage rises to 25% (or 8.0). the best treatment option could not be found. bacteria were found in 9/21 lesions. the most prominent species was p. gingivalis. conclusions: when an endodontic pathology is present on the extracted or neighbouring teeth, it is significantly  more likely that a periapical lesion will develop around a future implant.

TI  == role of the nk cell-activating receptor cracc in periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is a highly prevalent, biofilm-mediated chronic inflammatory disease that results in the loss of the tooth-supporting tissues. it features two major clinical entities: chronic periodontitis, which is more common, and aggressive periodontitis, which usually has an early onset and a rapid progression. natural killer (nk) cells are a distinct subgroup of lymphocytes that play a major role in the ability of the innate immune system to steer immune responses. nk cells are abundant in periodontitis lesions, and nk cell activation has been causally linked to periodontal tissue destruction. however, the exact mechanisms of their activation and their role in the pathophysiology of periodontitis are elusive. here, we show that the predominant nk cell-activating  molecule in periodontitis is cd2-like receptor activating cytotoxic cells (cracc). we show that cracc induction was significantly more pronounced in aggressive than chronic periodontitis and correlated positively with periodontal  disease severity, subgingival levels of specific periodontal pathogens, and nk cell activation in vivo. we delineate how aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  an oral pathogen that is causally associated with aggressive periodontitis, indirectly induces cracc on nk cells via activation of dendritic cells and subsequent interleukin 12 (il-12) signaling. in contrast, we demonstrate that fimbriae from porphyromonas gingivalis, a principal pathogen in chronic periodontitis, actively attenuate cracc induction on nk cells. our data suggest an involvement of cracc-mediated nk cell activation in periodontal tissue destruction and point to a plausible distinction in the pathobiology of aggressive and chronic periodontitis that may help explain the accelerated tissue destruction in aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == adjunctive effect of chlorhexidine antiseptics in mechanical periodontal treatment: first results of a preliminary case series.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present case series was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of a single session of mechanical and manual scaling and  root planing (srp) combined with the use of two different chlorhexidine formulations in the treatment for generalized chronic periodontitis. methods: ten patients affected by chronic periodontal disease with periodontal probing depth (ppd) >/= 5 mm were treated with srp plus local chlorhexidine. in each patient, similar teeth, treated with srp with the adjunctive use of chlorhexidine digluconate and dihydrochloride or chlorhexidine gluconate, respectively, were selected and assigned to a test and a control group. in both groups, ppd, bleeding on probing (bop) parameters, total bacterial counts (tbc) and quality of periodontal bacteria at time 0 and 6 weeks after treatment were measured. results: ppd significantly decreased over time both in the test and in the control group; however, no significant differences between the two groups were observed. bop and tbc were significantly lower in the test than in the control group 6 weeks after treatment. in the post-treatment revaluation, a significant decrease both in the treatment and in the control group, for each of the single periodontal pathogens, was observed. conclusion: in this study--a preliminary case series with small sample size and short follow-up--the adjunctive use of chlorhexidine (chx) to srp resulted in clinical and microbiological benefits in the treatment for generalized chronic periodontitis. a chx gel formulation consisting of chx digluconate and chx dihydrochloride seems to lead some additional benefits over srp plus chx gluconate in the short term. additional investigations are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this antiseptic therapy.

TI  == association of serum anti-periodontal pathogen antibody with ischemic stroke.
AB  == background: periodontitis increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and ischemic stroke. in this study, we evaluated whether serum antibody levels against individual periodontal pathogens are significantly associated with ischemic stroke subtypes and their risk factors. methods: patients with acute ischemic stroke (n = 132; 74 male and 58 female, 71.3 +/- 10.7 years) and patients with no previous stroke (n = 77; 38 male and 39 female, 70.7 +/- 9.5 years) were consecutively enrolled in this study. stroke subtype was evaluated based on the trial of org 10172 in acute stroke treatment classification. serum was obtained from each patient after obtaining their consent to participate in the study. the levels of serum antibodies against aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and prevotella intermedia (pi) were evaluated by elisa. serum high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp) levels were measured by nephelometry. results: serum hs-crp levels were significantly associated with acute ischemic stroke even after controlling for acute ischemic stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and bulb/  internal carotid artery (ica) atherosclerosis which were statistically selected (coefficient 0.245, 95% ci 0.142-0.347, p < 0.0001). the serum-antibody level of  pi was significantly higher in atherothrombotic-stroke patients than in patients  with no previous stroke (p = 0.0035). detectable serum anti-pg antibody was significantly associated with atrial fibrillation (overall chi(2) = 35.5, r(2) =  0.18, n = 209, p < 0.0001; anti-pg antibody: or 4.36, 95% ci 1.71-12.10, p = 0.0017), and detectable serum anti-pi antibody was significantly associated with  bulb/ica atherosclerosis after controlling for the statistically selected associated factors (overall chi(2) = 46.1, r(2) = 0.18, n = 209, p < 0.0001; anti-pg antibody: or 16.58, 95% ci 3.96-78.93, p < 0.0001). the levels of serum anti-pi antibody were significantly associated with atherothrombotic stroke with  the statistically selected associated factors excluding bulb/ica atherosclerosis  (overall chi(2) = 77.0, r(2) = 0.44, n = 129, p < 0.0001; anti-pi antibody: or 23.6, 95% ci 2.65-298.2, p = 0.008). however, when we included bulb/ica atherosclerosis in this model, the levels of serum anti-pi antibody were no longer significantly associated with atherothrombotic stroke (overall chi(2) = 98.0, r(2) = 0.56, n = 129, p < 0.0001; anti-pi antibody: p = 0.107). conclusions: our results suggest that anti-pg antibody is associated with atrial  fibrillation and that anti-pi antibody is associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis. in addition, anti-pi antibody may be associated with atherothrombotic stroke through its association with carotid artery atherosclerosis. thus, periodontitis may lead to serious systemic diseases.

TI  == optimization of quantitative polymerase chain reactions for detection and quantification of eight periodontal bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to optimize quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for 8 major periodontal pathogens, i.e. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tanerella forsythia and  treponema denticola, and of the caries pathogen streptococcus mutans. results: eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using blast analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at primer binding sites (using mfold). the most specific and efficiently binding primer pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qpcr-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility.  for the selected primer pairs, one for each species, the specificity was confirmed by assessing amplification of dna extracts from isolates of closely related species. for these primer pairs, the intercycler portability was evaluated on 3 different thermal cyclers (the applied biosystems 7300, the bio-rad iq5 and the roche light cycler 480). for all assays on the different cyclers, a good correlation of the standard series was obtained (i.e. r2 >/= 0.98), but quantification limits varied among cyclers. the overall best quantification limit was obtained by using a 2 mul sample in a final volume of 10 mul on the light cycler 480. conclusions: in conclusion, the proposed assays allow to quantify the bacterial loads of s. mutans, 6 periodontal pathogenic species and the genus fusobacterium.this can be of use in assessing periodontal risk, determination of the optimal periodontal therapy and evaluation of this treatment.

TI  == influence of periodontal status and periodontopathogens on levels of oral human beta-defensin-2 in saliva.
AB  == background: expression patterns of human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) mrna or hbd-2 protein concentration and periodontal diseases have been a focus of scientific research. this study compares the salivary levels of hbd-2 protein concentration  of healthy patients and patients with gingivitis and chronic periodontitis (cp) and correlates these levels with the presence of periodontopathogens. methods: a  total of 89 patients were enrolled in this study: 31 periodontally healthy, 27 with gingivitis, and 31 with cp. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and  clinical attachment level were measured. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated qualitatively by conventional polymerase chain reaction. hbd-2 quantification in  saliva was performed using an immune enzymatic assay. frequency of periodontopathogens and hbd-2 protein concentration was assessed. association between hbd-2 protein concentration (>/=100 pg/ml) and the simultaneous presence  of one to two, three to four, or five to six periodontopathogens was tested. results: although periodontally healthy individuals and patients with gingivitis  showed similar hbd-2 levels, the cp group displayed an increased level of hbd-2.  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and t. denticola were more prevalent  in cp; however, their mere presence was not related to the increased levels of hbd-2 (pearson correlation and multinomial logistic regression model). conclusions: salivary hbd-2 protein concentration was higher in patients with cp  compared with healthy individuals or patients with gingivitis. these different protein concentrations were not related to the frequency of periodontopathogens.  clinical inflammatory profile had a higher impact on salivary hbd-2 levels than bacteria.

TI  == protective effect of topical cordia verbenacea in a rat periodontitis model: immune-inflammatory, antibacterial and morphometric assays.
AB  == background: this study evaluated the effects of c. verbenacea essential oil topically administered in a rat periodontitis model. methods: periodontitis was induced on rats in one of the mandibular first molars assigned to receive a ligature. animals were randomly divided into two groups: a) non-treatment group (nt) (n = 18): animals received 1ml of vehicle; b) c. verbenacea group (c.v.) (n  = 18): animals received 5mg/kg of essential oils isolated from c. verbenacea. the therapies were administered topically 3 times daily for 11 days. then, the specimens were processed for morphometric analysis of bone loss. the ligatures were used for microbiological assessment of the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis using pcr. the gingival tissue was collected to elisa assay of interleukin (il)-1alpha  and il-10 levels. results: bone loss was inhibited by c. verbenacea when compared to the nt group (p < 0.05). a decrease in the levels of il-1alpha and increase in the il-10 amounts was observed in the c.v. group as compared to nt group (p < 0.05). a lower frequency of p. gingivalis was found in c.v. group (p < 0.05). conclusion: c. verbenacea essential oil topically administered diminished alveolar bone resorption, promoting a positive local imbalance in the pro/anti-inflammatory system and reducing the frequency of detection of p. gingivalis.

TI  == frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB  == objectives: this study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. design of study: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). results: the pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). except for p. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). the frequency of p.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). in periodontal samples, t. forsythia and t. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). the frequencies of c. rectus and t. forsythia  were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). the frequency of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). conclusions: bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. there was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.

TI  == possible translocation of periodontal pathogens into the lymph nodes draining the oral cavity.
AB  == numerous publications have reported the presence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in peripheral and central vascular lesions. however, it is unclear how this bacterial translocation occurs. the objective of this study was to investigate whether periodontopathic bacteria are translocated to lymph nodes proximal to the oral cavity. obtaining lymph node samples is not ethically feasible unless they are excised as part of the surgical management of patients with cancer. this study analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph nodes, histologically negative for cancer cell invasion, that were excised from 66 patients with histories of head and neck cancer. real-time pcr was performed to amplify the 16s ribosomal dna fragments from porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. the relationship between bacterial detection and cancer severity, gender, and the use of anti-cancer therapy was examined by fisher's exact test. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. intermedia were present in 17%, 8%, and 8% of the samples of submandibular and submental lymph nodes, respectively. there were  no significant relationships between bacterial detection and the cancer disease status, patient gender or use of anticancer therapy. according to these data, it  appears that the translocation of periodontopathic bacteria may occur via lymphatic drainage, irrespective of the cancer disease status, gender or anticancer therapy.

TI  == cleavage of igg1 in gingival crevicular fluid is associated with the presence of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objectives: immunoglobulin (ig) g1 plays an important role in the  adaptive immune response. kgp, a lysine-specific cysteine protease from porphyromonas gingivalis, specifically hydrolyses igg1 heavy chains. the purpose  of this study was to examine whether cleavage of igg1 occurs in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in vivo, and whether there is any association with the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathogens. material and  methods: gcf was obtained from nine patients with aggressive periodontitis, nine  with chronic periodontitis and five periodontally healthy individuals. the bacterial loads of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella  forsythia were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the presence  and cleavage of igg1 and igg2 were determined using western blotting. kgp levels  were measured by elisa. results: cleaved igg1 was identified in the gcf from 67%  of patients with aggressive periodontitis and in 44% of patients with chronic periodontitis. by contrast, no cleaved igg1 was detectable in healthy controls. no degradation of igg2 was detected in any of the samples, regardless of health status. porphyromonas gingivalis was found in high numbers in all samples in which cleavage of igg1 was detected (p < 0.001 compared with samples with no igg  cleavage). furthermore, high numbers of tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were also present in these samples. the level of kgp in the gcf correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis (r = 0.425, p < 0.01). the presence of kgp (range 0.07-10.98 ng/ml) was associated with proteolytic fragments of igg1 (p < 0.001). however, cleaved igg1 was also detected in samples with no detectable kgp. conclusion: in patients with periodontitis, cleavage of igg1 occurs in vivo and may suppress antibody-dependent antibacterial activity in subgingival biofilms especially those colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == effects of biphenyl sulfonylamino methyl bisphosphonic acids on porphyromonas gingivalis and cytokine secretion by oral epithelial cells.
AB  == bisphosphonate drugs are well known to inhibit osteoclastic activity and have been proposed for the management of bone diseases, including periodontitis which  is associated with alveolar bone destruction. in this study, we evaluated the effects of four arylsulfonamide bisphosphonates on growth of the periodontopathogenic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis as well as their capacity to reduce cytokine secretion by lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated oral epithelial cells. the growth of p. gingivalis was inhibited by (4'-chloro-biphenyl-4-sulfonylamino)methyl-1,1- bisphosphonic acid while the three other arylsulfonamide bisphosphonates ((4-methoxy-phenylsulfonylamino)methyl-1,1- bisphosphonic acid, (4-nitro-phenylsulfonylamino)methyl-1,1-bisphosphonic acid, and (biphenyl-4-sulfonylamino) methyl-1,1-bisphosphonic acid) had no effect. growth inhibition was more pronounced under an iron-restricted condition. all four arylsulfonamide bisphosphonates decreased the production of the pro-inflammatory  cytokines il-6 and il-8 by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lps-stimulated oral epithelial cells. in conclusion, we uncovered additional properties of bisphosphonates that may be beneficial for the treatment of periodontal diseases. in particular, (4'-chlorobiphenyl- 4-sulfonylamino)methyl-1,1-bisphosphonic acid  combines the already disclosed antiresoptive activity with antiinflammatory and antibacterial properties.

TI  == reduction of salivary arginine catabolic activity through periodontal therapy.
AB  == objective: salivary enzymes may be used to diagnose periodontal conditions. salivary arginase activity (saa) is related to susceptibility to bacterial infection. therefore, the aim of this controlled interventional study was to determine the saa before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. method and materials: eighty-nine subjects were selected: 31 periodontally healthy patients  (controls), 27 gingivitis patients, and 31 chronic periodontitis patients. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were monitored. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction.  salivary total protein level and saa were also established by spectrophotometry.  clinical and arginase data were analyzed using the wilcoxon, mann-withney, and kruskal-wallis tests (p < .05). for microbial data, the chi-square test was used. the pearson correlation test was also used between each parameter evaluated. results: after therapy, due to a significant reduction in saa, the values observed for the gingivitis and periodontitis groups were similar to those found  in the healthy group. interestingly, after therapy, saa followed the same positive pattern showed by the overall improvement of clinical parameters (gingivitis and periodontitis groups mean values, pre- > posttherapy) and by the  reduction of target pathogens (gingivitis group t forsythia, pre- > posttherapy;  periodontitis group p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia, pre- > posttherapy). conclusion: based on the reduction of saa after therapy, in  accordance with the expected reduction in clinical and microbiologic parameters,  it was concluded that saa has the potential to serve as a reliable method to access to the therapeutic response of chronic periodontitis subjects treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy.

TI  == variables of host response in saliva of patients with periodontitis: a pilot study.
AB  == objective: periodontitis is an infection that results from an imbalance between periodontopathic microorganisms and the local and systemic host defense. this study analyzed saliva samples of patients with periodontitis for several biomarkers of host response. method and materials: saliva was collected from 13 patients with chronic periodontitis, seven patients with aggressive periodontitis, and 13 periodontally healthy control subjects. diverse markers of  host response representing innate and adaptive immune response as well as antioxidative variables were determined. results: patients with aggressive periodontitis had significantly higher values of lipid peroxidation and cathepsin c activity in saliva. the highest activities of neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, and superoxide dismutase were measured in chronic periodontitis patients. levels of antimicrobial peptides hnps 1-3 were significantly highest in chronic periodontitis patients than in aggressive periodontitis or control subjects. immunoglobulin g levels directed against aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were highest in aggressive periodontitis patients, while those directed against porphyromonas gingivalis were highest in chronic periodontitis patients. immunoglobulin a levels directed against these periodontopathogens did not differ among the groups. conclusion: chronic periodontitis patients showed higher levels of markers primarily associated with combating infection. the levels of markers known mainly for tissue damage were higher in aggressive periodontitis patients.  neutrophil-related markers may be able to identify and differentiate patients with periodontitis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis displays a competitive advantage over aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in co-cultured biofilm.
AB  == background and objective: biofilm formation occurs through the events of cooperative growth and competitive survival among multiple species. porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are important periodontal pathogens. the aim of this study was to demonstrate competitive or cooperative interactions between these two species in co-cultured biofilm. material and methods: p. gingivalis strains and gingipain mutants were cultured with or without a. actinomycetemcomitans. biofilms formed on glass surfaces were analyzed by crystal violet staining and colony counting. preformed a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms were treated with p. gingivalis culture supernatants. growth and proteolytic activities of gingipains were also determined. results: monocultured p. gingivalis strains exhibited a range of biofilm-formation abilities and proteolytic activities. the atcc33277 strain, noted for its high biofilm-formation ability and proteolytic activity, was found  to be dominant in biofilm co-cultured with a. actinomycetemcomitans. in a time-resolved assay, a. actinomycetemcomitans was primarily the dominant colonizer on a glass surface and subsequently detached in the presence of increasing numbers of atcc33277. detachment of preformed a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm was observed by incubation with culture supernatants from highly proteolytic strains. conclusion: these results suggest that p. gingivalis possesses a competitive advantage over a. actinomycetemcomitans. as the required  biofilm-formation abilities and proteolytic activities vary among p. gingivalis strains, the diversity of the competitive advantage is likely to affect disease recurrence during periodontal maintenance.

TI  == assessment of the plasma/serum igg test to screen for periodontitis.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a silent infectious disease prevalent worldwide and affects lifestyle-related diseases. therefore, efficient screening of patients is essential for general health. this study was performed to evaluate prospectively  the diagnostic utility of a blood igg antibody titer test against periodontal pathogens. oral examination was performed, and igg titers against periodontal pathogens were measured by elisa in 1,387 individuals. the cut-off value of the igg titer was determined in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and changes in periodontal clinical parameters and igg titers by periodontal treatment were evaluated. the relationships between igg titers and severity of periodontitis were analyzed. the best cut-off value of igg titer against porphyromonas gingivalis for screening periodontitis was 1.682. both clinical parameters and igg titers decreased significantly under periodontal treatment. igg titers of periodontitis patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls, especially in those with sites of probing pocket depth over 4 mm. multiplied cut-off values were useful to select patients with severe periodontitis. a blood igg antibody titer test for porphyromonas gingivalis is useful to screen hitherto chronic periodontitis patients.

TI  == detection and enumeration of periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival biofilm of pregnant women.
AB  == the aim of this study was to use the fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) technique to test the hypothesis of qualitative and quantitative differences of 8 periodontopathogens between pregnant and non-pregnant women. this cross-sectional study included 20 pregnant women in their second trimester of pregnancy and 20 non-pregnant women. probing depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and presence of calculus were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected and the fish technique identified the presence and numbers of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the mann-whitney u-test was applied to compare the data between the two groups. the mean age, ethnicity, marital status, education, and economic level in both groups were similar. the clinical parameters showed no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women. the numbers of subgingival periodontopathogens were not found to be significantly different between groups, despite the higher mean counts of p. intermedia in pregnant women. colonization patterns of the different bacteria  most commonly associated with periodontal disease were not different in the subgingival plaque of pregnant and non-pregnant women.

TI  == induction of toll-like receptor expression by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background: toll-like receptors (tlrs) play pivotal roles in host immune responses and have been suggested to be involved in the development of many infectious diseases. in this study, the mrna expression levels of tlr2, tlr4, and tlr9 and their relationship with periodontopathic bacteria in periodontal tissue  are examined. furthermore, the mechanism of tlr induction by porphyromonas gingivalis is investigated in human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs). methods: gingival tissue and subgingival plaque samples were collected from 19 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) and 16 control individuals without periodontitis. gene expression levels in the tissues and in hgfs were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). the numbers of periodontopathic bacteria were determined by quantitative real-time pcr. results: the expression levels of tlr2 and tlr9 were significantly higher in the tissues of patients with cp compared to the tissues of control individuals. the mrna levels of tlr2 and tlr9, but not tlr4, were positively correlated with the number of p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque. p. gingivalis sonicated extract, p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, p. gingivalis dna, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(tnf-alpha) could significantly upregulate the mrna expression of tlr2 in hgfs. furthermore,  p. gingivalis-mediated tlr2 expression was suppressed by tnf-alpha antibody. conclusions: this study suggests that p. gingivalis infection induces tlr2 and tlr9 upregulation in patients with cp. p. gingivalis-induced tlr2 expression in hgfs is partially dependent on tnf-alpha and may lead to sensitization of hgfs to bacterial components encountered in the periodontal microenvironment.

TI  == a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on the clinical and microbial  effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used by patients in supportive periodontal care.
AB  == aim: this 3-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study evaluated the  clinical and microbial effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control by patients in supportive periodontal care. material and methods: fifty patients were randomly allocated to an essential oil group (listerine((r)) coolmint; johnson & johnson, new brunswick, nj, usa) or placebo group to rinse twice per day as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control. at baseline and after 3 months, plaque index (pi), gingivitis index (gi), probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing (bop) and clinical attachment level were registered. subgingival plaque samples were collected for the detection and quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium genus and streptococcus mutans by means of real-time pcr (qpcr). patient's compliance, satisfaction and side effects were registered. results: twenty-three patients in the essential oil group (mean age:  57) and 21 in the placebo group (mean age: 55) with acceptable oral hygiene at intake (mean pi <1.5 on a scale of 5) adhered to the study protocol. gingivitis index, pi and bop significantly reduced over time (p </= 0.029); however, between group analyses revealed no significant differences. there was no significant change over time neither in detection frequency nor load for any of the microbiota. daily rinsing with an essential oil rinse was found safe and perceived beneficial by the patients. conclusion: patients in supportive periodontal care who are fairly compliant with oral hygiene may not benefit from  additional mouth rinsing using an essential oil solution.

TI  == quantification of periodontopathic bacteria in saliva using the invader assay.
AB  == when quantifying periodontopathic bacteria, it is important to use a convenient method that does not produce false negative results. the invader assay is a convenient method because it does not involve gene amplification. the purpose of  this study was to evaluate the validity of the invader assay to quantify periodontopathic bacteria. the invader technology was applied in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola). the invader assay produced a linear quantitative detection range over concentrations spanning seven exponential values, with a detection limit of 10(3.7) copies/tube and intra-day and inter-day variance of 0.1% to 4.7% and 0.1% to 3.4%, respectively, in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria. we compared the results of the invader assay with those of real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) performed for quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria in 22 patients with periodontitis. among the invader-detectable bacterial strains of each species, significant correlations were observed in the counts of concerned bacterial species between these two methods, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.757 to 0.996. this study validated repeatability and reproducibility of the invader assay in quantifying periodontopathic bacteria and demonstrated consistent agreement between the invader assay and real-time pcr in  quantifying periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7 +/- 7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8 +/- 8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == analysis of viable vs. dead aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis using selective quantitative real-time pcr with propidium monoazide.
AB  == background and objectives: one of the major disadvantages of dna-based microbial  diagnostics is their inability to differentiate dna between viable and dead microorganisms, which could be important when studying etiologically relevant pathogens. the aim of this investigation was to optimize a method for the selective detection and quantification of only viable aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis cells by combining quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and propidium monoazide (pma). material and methods: three different concentrations of pma (10, 50 or 100 mum) were added to suspensions of 10(6) (cfu)/ml of viable/dead a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis cells. after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the tested bacteria. pma was further tested with different mixtures containing varying ratios of viable and dead cells. the efficacy of pma to detect viable/dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: for these specific bacterial pathogens, 100 mum pma resulted in a significant reduction of qpcr amplification with dead cells (10(6) cfu/ml), while with viable cells no significant inhibition was detected. pma was also effective in detecting selectively viable cells by qpcr detection, when mixtures of varying ratios of viable and dead bacteria were used. conclusions: this study demonstrated the efficiency of pma for differentiating viable and dead a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis cells. this method of  pma-qpcr may be useful for monitoring new antimicrobial strategies and for assessing the pathogenic potential of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis  in different oral conditions when using molecular diagnostic methods.

TI  == association of cd14-260 polymorphisms, red-complex periodontopathogens and gingival crevicular fluid cytokine levels with cyclosporine a-induced gingival overgrowth in renal transplant patients.
AB  == backgroud and objective: genetic factors may influence the colonization of pathogenic bacteria, therefore increasing the risk for the initiation and development of periodontal disease. the present study was carried out to investigate the association of cd14-260 polymorphisms, subgingival microbiota, and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) cytokine levels with cyclosporine a (csa)-induced gingival overgrowth (go) in renal transplant patients. material and methods: a total of 204 patients were dichotomized into two groups: 124 with go and 80 without go. the cd14-260 polymorphisms were measured using an allele-specific pcr method. the levels of periodontal pathogens were determined by real-time pcr of subgingival samples. gcf levels of il-1beta and scd14 were detected by elisa. results: the frequency of cd14-260 genotype ct + tt was found  to be similar in both groups. patients with go presented increased prevalence of  pg, td, and tf (red complex) and significantly higher levels of interleukin -1beta than those without go. patients with go carrying ct + tt genotypes were found to have higher frequencies of pg, td, and tf than those carrying the cc genotype. furthermore, in the presence of red complex, ct + tt genotypes were associated with higher interleukin -1beta levels and severe go. multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the severity of go is not dependent on age, gender and pharmacological variables, being only associated with cd14-260 genotype and red complex periodontopathogens. conclusion: no association between  cd14-260 polymorphisms and the prevalence of go was revealed in renal transplant  patients administered csa. however, cd14-260 ct + tt genotypes are associated with the prevalence of red complex periodontopathogens in patients with go, and may thus play some role in the development of severe csa-induced go.

TI  == bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial  dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. the quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion  method. results: using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall  showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. conclusion: it was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility profiles of oral pathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is a bacterial disease that can be treated with systemic antibiotics. the aim of this study was to establish the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of five periodontal pathogens to six commonly used antibiotics in periodontics. a total of 247 periodontal bacterial isolates were tested for susceptibility to the six antibiotics using the etest method. mic(50) and mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) were calculated. both european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) and clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) breakpoints were used in the study to interpret results. beta-lactamase production was tested when amoxicillin resistance was found. mic(90) values of the anaerobic bacteria were all well below breakpoint values, except for three isolates of prevotella intermedia and one isolate of fusobacterium nucleatum that were resistant to amoxicillin (clsi breakpoints); these isolates were beta-lactamase-positive. two isolates of the capnophilic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans appeared to be amoxicillin-resistant but failed to show beta-lactamase activity. comparison with a previous study from the netherlands showed minor differences in susceptibility profiles, but the mic(90) values of a. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin and tetracycline were higher. geographical differences in the susceptibility profiles of porphyromonas gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans between european countries  were noted. comparison of european susceptibility profiles with that of a south american country (colombia) revealed a much higher resistance in the latter. owing to these differences in susceptibility profiles, it is of concern to regularly perform surveillance studies on antibiotic resistance.

TI  == prediagnostic plasma antibody levels to periodontopathic bacteria and risk of coronary heart disease.
AB  == many epidemiological studies have indicated that periodontitis is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease (chd). we examined whether plasma antibody levels to 3 major periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia predicted the risk of chd events. a nested case-control research design (case: n = 191, control: n = 382),  by matching gender, age, study area, date of blood collection, and time since last meal at blood collection, was employed in a large cohort of japanese community residents.antibody levels of periodontopathic bacteria were associated  with risk of chd after adjusting for bmi, smoking status, alcohol intake, history of hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, exercise during leisure time, and  perceived mental stress. the association was different by age subgroup. for subjects aged 40-55 years, the medium (31.7-184.9 u/ml) or high tertile plasma antibody level (> 184.9 u/ml) of a. actinomycetemcomitans showed higher risk of chd (medium: or = 3.72; 95% ci = 1.20-11.56, high: or = 4.64; 95% ci = 1.52-14.18) than the low tertile level (< 31.7 u/ml). the ors of chd incidence became higher with an increase in igg level of a. actinomycetemcomitans (p for trend = 0.007). for subjects aged 56-69 years, the high tertile level (> 414.1 u/ml) of p. intermedia was associated with higher risk of chd (or = 2.65; 95% ci  = 1.18-5.94) in a dose-response fashion (p for trend = 0.007). the possible role  of periodontopathic bacteria as a risk factor for chd incidence was suggested by  the results of this study by the elevated antibody level to these bacteria with the increased risk of chd.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides and nitric oxide production by neutrophils from periodontitis subjects.
AB  == neutrophils play an important role in periodontitis by producing nitric oxide (no) and antimicrobial peptides, molecules with microbicidal activity via oxygen-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. it is unknown whether variation in the production of antimicrobial peptides such as ll-37, human neutrophil peptides (hnp) 1-3, and no by neutrophils influences the pathogenesis  of periodontal diseases. we compared the production of these peptides and no by lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated neutrophils isolated from healthy subjects and from patients with periodontitis. peripheral blood neutrophils were cultured  with or without aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-lps (aa-lps), porphyromonas gingivalis-lps (pg-lps) and escherichia coli-lps (ec-lps). qrt-pcr was used to determine quantities of hnp 1-3 and ll-37 mrna in neutrophils. amounts of hnp 1-3 and ll-37 proteins in the cell culture supernatants were also determined by elisa. in addition, no levels in neutrophil culture supernatants were quantitated by the griess reaction. neutrophils from periodontitis patients cultured with aa-lps, pg-lps and ec-lps expressed higher hnp 1-3 mrna than neutrophils from healthy subjects. ll-37 mrna expression was higher in neutrophils from patients stimulated with aa-lps. neutrophils from periodontitis patients produced significantly higher ll-37 protein levels than neutrophils from healthy subjects  when stimulated with pg-lps and ec-lps, but no difference was observed in hnp 1-3 production. neutrophils from periodontitis patients cultured or not with pg-lps and ec-lps produced significantly lower no levels than neutrophils from healthy subjects. the significant differences in the production of ll-37 and no between neutrophils from healthy and periodontitis subjects indicate that production of these molecules might influence individual susceptibility to important periodontal pathogens.

AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == clinical and microbiological parameters in patients with self-ligating and conventional brackets during early phase of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of different bracket designs (conventional brackets and self-ligating brackets) on periodontal clinical parameters and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. material and methods: the following  inclusion criteria were used: requirement of orthodontic treatment plan starting  with alignment and leveling, good general health, healthy periodontium, no antibiotic therapy in the previous 6 months before the beginning of the study, and no smoking. the study sample totaled 38 patients (13 male, 25 female; mean age, 14.6 +/- 2.0 years). patients were divided into two groups with random distribution of brackets. recording of clinical parameters was done before the placement of the orthodontic appliance (t0) and at 6 weeks (t1), 12 weeks (t2), and 18 weeks (t3) after full bonding of orthodontic appliances. periodontal pathogens of subgingival microflora were detected at t3 using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test (micro-dent test) that contains probes for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: there was a statistically significant higher prevalence of a actinomycetemcomitans in patients with conventional brackets than in patients with self-ligating brackets, but there was no statistically significant difference for other putative periodontal pathogens. the two different types of brackets did not show statistically significant differences in periodontal clinical parameters. conclusion: bracket design does not seem to have a strong influence on periodontal clinical parameters and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque.  the correlation between some periodontal pathogens and clinical periodontal parameters was weak.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens among patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the periodontal pathogens that form the red complex (tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in  patients with chronic periodontitis. the sample consisted of 29 patients with a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of chronic periodontitis based on the criteria of the american academy of periodontology (3). samples for microbiological analysis were collected from the four sites of greatest probing depth in each patient, totaling 116 samples. these samples were processed using conventional polymerase chain reaction, which achieved the following positive results: 46.6% for p. gingivalis, 41.4% for t. forsythia, 33.6% for t. denticola  and 27.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more  prevalent (p < 0.05) in periodontal pockets >/= 8 mm. the combinations t. forsythia + p. gingivalis (23.2%) and t. forsythia + p. gingivalis + t. denticola (20.0%) were more frequent in sites with a probing depth >/= 8 mm. associations with the simultaneous presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans + p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans + t. forsythia, p. gingivalis + t. forsythia and t. forsythia + t. denticola were statistically significant (p < 0.05). it was concluded that the red complex pathogens are related to chronic periodontitis, presenting a higher occurrence in deep periodontal pockets. moreover, the simultaneous presence of these bacteria in deep sites suggests a symbiotic relationship between these virulent species, favoring, in this way, a further progression of periodontal disease.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of nanoparticulate metal oxides against peri-implantitis pathogens.
AB  == dental plaque accumulation may result in peri-implantitis, an inflammatory process causing loss of supporting bone that may lead to dental implant failure.  the antimicrobial activities of six metal and metal oxide nanoparticles and two of their composites against bacterial pathogens associated with peri-implantitis  were examined under anaerobic conditions. the activities of nanoparticles of silver (ag), cuprous oxide (cu(2)o), cupric oxide (cuo), zinc oxide (zno), titanium dioxide (tio(2)), tungsten oxide (wo(3)), ag+cuo composite and ag+zno composite were assessed by minimum inhibitory (bacteriostatic) concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) determination against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. time-kill assays were carried out to examine the dynamics of the antimicrobial activity with zno nanoparticles. mic and mbc values were in the range of <100 mug/ml to 2500 mug/ml and <100 mug/ml to >2500 mug/ml, respectively. the activity of the nanoparticles tested in descending order was ag>ag+cuo>cu(2)o>cuo>ag+zno>zno>tio(2)>wo(3). time-kill assays with zno demonstrated a significant decrease in growth of all species tested within 4h, reaching 100% within 2h for p. gingivalis and within 3h for f.  nucleatum and p. intermedia. coating titanium surfaces of dental and orthopaedic  implants with antimicrobial nanoparticles should lead to an increased rate of implant success.

TI  == [amalgam, composite and compomer: microbiological study].
AB  == restorative materials have different consequences on the periodontium. the surface of these materials may influence gingival health and cause in some instances gingival inflammation. the purpose of this study was to investigate and compare, in a healthy periodontium, intracrevicular plaque bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola), at day 0 and at 6 months, around subgingivally located amalgam, composite and compomer fillings. all the tests were negative (less than 0.1% of the sum of 103 cells), since none  of the investigated pathogens were detected. it has been concluded that the material used does not have direct effect on the bacteria species developed around the restorations at this short time period.

TI  == a common periodontal pathogen has an adverse association with both acute and stable coronary artery disease.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the association between angiographically verified coronary artery disease (cad) and salivary levels of four major periodontal pathogens. methods: the study population (n = 492) was composed of 179 (36.4%) patients with stable cad, 166 (33.7%) with acute coronary syndrome (acs), and 119 (24.2%) showing no pathological findings by coronary angiography. all patients were subjected to a detailed oral health examination. the saliva samples were analyzed for lipopolysaccharide activity as well as for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia by quantitative pcr. serum antibodies levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans were analyzed. results: the level of bacterial burden was linearly associated with alveolar bone loss (p < 0.001) and bleeding on probing (p = 0.015). the median salivary levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans in pathogen-positive patients were significantly higher in the "stable cad" (p = 0.014) and the "acs" (p = 0.044) groups when compared to "no significant cad" patients. in logistic regression models, a 10-fold increase in the salivary a. actinomycetemcomitans levels was associated with a risk for stable cad and acs with odds ratios (ors) of 7.47 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.57-35.5, p = 0.012) and 4.31 (95% ci: 1.06-17.5, p = 0.041), respectively. the or for the association of iga-class antibody levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans with acs risk was 3.13 (95% ci: 1.38-7.12, p = 0.006)/log(10) unit increase. conclusions: high salivary levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and systemic exposure to the bacterium were associated with increased risk for cad. these findings emphasize the importance of oral microbiota in cardiovascular risk assessment and therapeutics.

TI  == antimicrobial constituents of artemisia afra jacq. ex willd. against periodontal  pathogens.
AB  == the phytochemical investigation of an ethanol extract of artemisia afra led to the isolation of six known compounds, acacetin (1), 12alpha,4alpha-dihydroxybishopsolicepolide (2), scopoletin (3), alpha-amyrin (4), phytol (5), and a pentacyclic triterpenoid betulinic acid (6). the compounds were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against gram positive (actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus mutans), gram negative bacteria (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans previously known as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans),  and candida albicans. the crude extract of a. afra inhibited the growth of all tested microbial species at concentration range of 1.6 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml. the compounds 1-6 also showed activity range at 1.0 mg/ml to 0.25 mg/ml. three best compounds (scopoletin, betulinic acid, and acacetin) which showed good antimicrobial activity were selected for further studies. cytotoxicity of extract and compounds was determined using the xtt cell proliferation kit. the antioxidant activity of the extract and compounds was done using the dpph scavenging method. the extract showed good antioxidant activity with an ic(50) value of 22.2 mug/ml. scopoletin had a strong transformation of the dpph radical  into its reduced form, with an ic(50) value of 1.24 mug/ml which was significant  to that of vitamin c (1.22 mug/ml). acacetin and betulinic acid exhibited a decreased scavenging activity with the ic(50) of 2.39 and 2.42 mug/ml, respectively. the extract and compounds showed moderate toxicity on mccoy fibroblast cell line and scopoletin was relatively nontoxic with an ic(50) value  of 132.5 mug/ml. acacetin and betulinic acid also showed a smooth trend of non-toxic effects with ic(50) values of 35.44 and 30.96 mug/ml. the obtained results in this study confirm the use of a. afra in the treatment of microbial infections.

TI  == peripheral arterial disease associated with caries and periodontal disease.
AB  == background: peripheral arterial disease (pad) is an important cardiovascular disorder of the peripheral arteries. chronic infections, such as periodontitis, may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of pad and other cardiovascular conditions. recently, streptococcus mutans has been found with high frequency in atheromatous plaques. the aim of this study is to evaluate the  possible clinical and microbiologic association between pad and periodontitis and dental caries. methods: thirty patients with pad and 30 control individuals were  selected. pad and its severity were established by the use of the ankle-brachial  index (abi). clinical attachment loss (al); probing depth; decayed, missing, and  filled teeth (dmft) index; and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were evaluated. the presence of bacterial dna from streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival biofilm and serum. results: patients with >/=30% al >/= 4 mm had six-fold increased risk of having pad (odds ratio = 8.18; 95% confidence interval = 1.21 to 35.23; p = 0.031). there was statistical difference in the crp (p = 0.0413) and dmft index (p = 0.0002), with elevated number of missing teeth (p = 0.0459) in the pad group compared with the control group. there were no significant differences in the frequency of bacteria in serum and subgingival plaque. conclusion: there was a positive relationship between periodontitis based on al and pad determined by the abi (odds ratio = 8.18).

TI  == fcgammariib-nt645+25a/g gene polymorphism and periodontitis in japanese women with preeclampsia.
AB  == fcgammariib contains a unique immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (itim) and functions as a negative feedback regulator of leucocyte activation and antibody production. we have previously reported fcgammariib-nt645+25a/g gene polymorphism to be associated with prevalence and severity of periodontitis, fcgammariib expression level on peripheral b lymphocytes and the serum igg level  against periodontopathic bacteria. previous studies have reported maternal periodontal disease to be associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia. therefore, fcgammariib-nt645+25a/g gene polymorphism may be associated with preeclampsia by affecting immune response to periodontopathic bacteria in pregnant women. to elucidate whether fcgammariib-nt645+25a/g gene polymorphism has associations with preeclampsia and/or periodontitis in pregnant japanese women, a case-control study was carried out on women with preeclampsia (n = 13) and without preeclampsia (n = 106). maternal periodontal parameters and bacterial data of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque were collected within 5 days of delivery. fcgammar genotypes of each woman were determined using the genomic dna  isolated from peripheral blood. serum igg levels specific for each bacteria were  determined. there was a significant association between fcgammariib-nt645+25a/g polymorphism and preeclampsia (p = 0.013). the frequency of the fcgammariib-nt645+25aa genotype was higher in the preeclampsia group compared with the nonpreeclampsia group (p = 0.007). the dna level of a. actinomycetemcomitans from subgingival plaque was shown to be higher in the preeclampsia group (p = 0.017). in conclusion, maternal fcgammariib-nt645+25a/g polymorphism and subgingival dna level of a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly associated with the prevalence of preeclampsia in a limited number  of japanese women independently with periodontal infection. further investigations should be performed to confirm this association in a larger population and to determine the biological process of the association.

TI  == human salivary cystatin sa exhibits antimicrobial effect against aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background and objective: healthy subjects who do not have aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity may possess factors in saliva that might demonstrate antibacterial activity against the bacterium. the aim of this study was to identify and purify proteins from saliva of healthy subjects that might demonstrate antibacterial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans and test the same against the bacteria. material and methods: saliva from 10 healthy  volunteers was tested individually for its anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans activity. among the 10 subjects, eight demonstrated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans activity. saliva was collected from one healthy volunteer who demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans. after clarifying the saliva, it was subjected to an affinity chromatography column with a. actinomycetemcomitans. the proteins bound to a. actinomycetemcomitans were eluted from the column and identified using mass spectrometry (maldi-tof/tof ms). among  other proteins that bound to a. actinomycetemcomitans, which included lactoferrin, immunoglobulin a and kallikrein, cystatin sa was observed in significantly higher concentrations, and this was purified from the eluate. the purified cystatin sa was tested at different concentrations for its ability to kill a. actinomycetemcomitans in a 2 h cell killing assay. the bacteria were also treated with a proteinase inhibitor, leupeptin, to clarify whether the antimicrobial effect of cystatin sa was related to its protease inhibitory function. cystatin sa was also tested for its ability to prevent binding of a. actinomycetemcomitans to buccal epithelial cells (becs) in an a. actinomycetemcomitans-bec binding assay. results: cystatin sa (0.1 mg/ml) demonstrated a statistically significant antimicrobial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans. the effect of cystatin sa decreased with lower concentrations, with 0.01 mg/ml showing no effect. the addition of monoclonal cystatin sa antibodies to the purified sample completely negated the antimicrobial effect. treatment of a. actinomycetemcomitans with leupeptin resulted in no antimicrobial effect, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity of cystatin sa is independent of its protease inhibitory function. a. actinomycetemcomitans pretreated with cystatin sa showed reduced binding to becs, suggesting a potential role for cystatin sa in decreasing the colonization of a.  actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: the present study shows that cystatin sa demonstrates antimicrobial activity against the periodontopathogen a. actinomycetemcomitans, and future studies determining the mechanism of action are necessary. the study also shows the ability of cystatin sa to reduce significantly the binding of a. actinomycetemcomitans to becs.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

AB  == objective: to assess the pattern of early bacterial colonization at implants and  teeth in patients with a history of chronic periodontitis compared with a group of healthy subjects. furthermore, the presence of host-derived markers at teeth and implants in the two subject groups was determined. method and materials: subgingival and submucosal plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples from 37 nonsubmerged healing dental implants and the deepest tooth sites per quadrant were analyzed 2 to 5 months after implant insertion. the presence of periodontal  pathogens was assessed by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction. further,  the levels of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-8, and il-10; secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor; and the neutrophil elastase activity were determined. results: eleven patients with chronic periodontitis and 13 subjects without periodontitis were recruited for this study. bacterial species associated with periodontitis were detectable at both the teeth and implants. the presence was always higher in the chronic periodontitis group; the difference was significant  for porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans at both the implants and teeth. the levels of il-1beta were higher at teeth than at implants; in contrast, more il-10 was measured at the implants. conclusion: the present results indicate that (1) dental implants inserted in periodontally compromised patients are colonized with periodontal pathogens within the first weeks of healing; (2) inflammatory markers (il-1beta) are present in higher levels at teeth as compared with implants, whereas at implants, anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10) might play the important role; and (3) the importance of periodontal treatment prior to implant insertion to reduce bacterial load and inflammation should be emphasized.

TI  == oral bacteria and yeasts in relationship to oral ulcerations in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  == background: oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct). through hsct, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. the contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. the aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in hsct recipients. methods: this prospective observational study included 49 adult hsct recipients. twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the gram-negative bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and  treponema denticola; and the yeasts: candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida  kefyr, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis, and candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (gee) technique. results: none of the samples was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while f. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). c. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas c. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. multivariate gee analyses identified p. gingivalis, p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and  c. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. conclusions: our data indicate that p. gingivalis in particular, but also p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and c. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative  oral mucositis in patients undergoing hsct.

TI  == quantification of subgingival bacterial pathogens at different stages of periodontal diseases.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative oral bacteria such as treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum are closely associated with periodontal diseases. we measured the relative population (bacterial levels) of these oral pathogens in subgingival tissues of patients at  different stages of korean chronic periodontal diseases. we divided the individuals into those with chronic gingivitis (g), moderate periodontitis (p1),  severe periodontitis (p2), and normal individuals (n) (n = 20 for each group) and subgingival tissue samples were collected. we used real-time pcr with taqman probes to evaluate the change of periodontal pathogens among different stages of  periodontitis. bacterial levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus are significantly increased in individuals with chronic gingivitis and moderate periodontitis, but unchanged in severe periodontitis patients. these results suggest that analyzing certain bacterial levels among total oral pathogens may facilitate understanding of the role of periodontal bacteria in the early stages  of periodontitis.

TI  == probiotics and periodontal health.
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. the etiology is clearly bacterial and a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythus and porphyromonas gingivalis. comparatively, little attention has been paid to the identification of health-associated and potentially beneficial bacterial species that may reside in the gingival sulcus. probiotic technology represents a breakthrough approach to maintaining oral health by using natural beneficial bacteria, commonly found in healthy mouths, to provide a natural defense against those bacteria which are thought to be harmful to teeth and gums. this article endeavors to introduce the  concepts of probiotics in periodontics.

TI  == inhibitory activity of aloe vera gel on some clinically isolated cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == aloe vera is a medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and immune-boosting properties. in the present study we investigated the inhibitory activities of aloe vera gel on some cariogenic (streptococcus mutans), periodontopathic (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis) and an opportunistic periodontopathogen (bacteroides fragilis) isolated from patients with dental caries and periodontal diseases. twenty isolates of each of these bacteria were investigated for their sensitivity to aloe vera gel using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. s. mutans was the species most sensitive to aloe vera gel with a mic of 12.5 microg/ml, while a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and b. fragilis were less sensitive, with a mic of 25-50 microg/ml (p < 0.01). based on our present findings it is concluded that aloe vera gel at optimum concentration could be used as an antiseptic for prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == butyric acid induces apoptosis in both human monocytes and lymphocytes equivalently.
AB  == short-chain fatty acids (scfas) are metabolites from anaerobic periodontopathic bacteria that induce apoptosis in immune cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. however, it remains unclear if scfas from pathogens induce apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages similarly with lymphocytes. this study investigated whether scfas-induced apoptosis is equal among the immunoregulatory cells. cell apoptosis of the employed human cells was evaluated after treatment with culture  supernatants from various periodontopathic bacteria or sodium butyrate. apoptosis and viability were determined by detection of dna fragmentation and using an mts  assay kit, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum culture filtrates strongly induced apoptosis whereas prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia culture filtrates failed to induce apoptosis in the thp-1 and u937 human monocyte and macrophage cell lines. healthy gingival fibroblasts and oral epithelial cells were resistant to all the culture filtrates. gas-liquid chromatography detected butyric acid in p. gingivalis (21.0-34.0 mm) and f. nucleatum (36.0 mm) in culture filtrates, whereas, only trace levels were seen in p. nigrescens and p. intermedia. these results suggest that butyric acid produced by periodontopathic bacteria severely damages immunoregulatory cells in a consistent manner and, likewise, could be involved in mediating periodontal chronic inflammation.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity against periodontopathic bacteria by electrolyzed  ion-reduced water.
AB  == as typical periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) were exposed to electrolyzed ion-reduced water (eri) and eri containing 1% sodium carboxymethylcellulose (cmc-na) (eri-1% cmc-na), and the time course of their bactericidal action was evaluated. more than 99% of each bacteria species were killed after exposure to each solution for 15 sec. in addition, 1% cmc-na, which  was added to prolong bactericidal action, did not affect the bactericidal action  of eri. its bactericidal action was concentration-dependent. no viable p. gingivalis bacteria were observed at a concentration of 15% of the undiluted solution and no viable a. actinomycetemcomitans bacteria were observed at a concentration of 50%, indicating differences in the bactericidal action of eri for the two bacteria species. these results suggest that eri may be extremely useful in preventing and treating periodontal diseases.

TI  == specificity of antimicrobial peptide ll-37 to neutralize periodontopathogenic lipopolysaccharide activity in human oral fibroblasts.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 is known to have a potent lipopolysaccharide (lps)-neutralizing activity in various cell types. because of  observed heterogeneity within periodontopathogenic lps, the authors hypothesized  that ll-37 had specificity to neutralize such lps activity. the present study, therefore, aims to investigate the lps-neutralizing activity of ll-37 to various  periodontopathogenic lps in interleukin-8 (il-8) production after challenging them in human oral fibroblasts. methods: human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (pdlf) and gingival fibroblasts (gf) were cultured from biopsies of periodontal ligament and gingival tissues. after cell confluence in 24-well plates, lps (10 mug/ml) from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were added with or without ll-37 (10 mug/ml). after 18 hours, the supernatant was collected and analyzed in  il-8 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all periodontopathogenic lps statistically significantly induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf (p <0.01). after neutralization with ll-37, both pdlf and gf showed a statistically significant reduction in il-8 production compared with lps-treated groups without ll-37 (p <0.01), and the percentage of reduction in il-8 production in pdlf appeared to be higher than in gf. in addition, the percentage of reduction in il-8 production varied considerably according to each  periodontopathogenic lps. conclusions: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 had an ability to suppress periodontopathogenic lps-induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf. its lps-neutralizing activity revealed specificity to periodontopathogenic lps and seemed to be dependent on the heterogeneity within lps between different genera.

TI  == individual composition of human leukocyte antigens and periodontopathogens in the background of periodontitis.
AB  == background: human leukocyte antigens (hlas) are a basic precondition to induce the immune response to pathogens. therefore, this study evaluates associations among periodontitis, five key periodontopathic bacteria, and hlas to test their impact together with additional risk factors in multivariate analyses. methods: eighty-five patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and 71 patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (cp) were compared to 88 periodontitis-free controls. hla class i and ii typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific primers. subgingival plaque specimens were detected by pcr with sequence-specific oligonucleotides. risk-factor analyses were performed with respect to the cofactors age, sex, smoking, and plaque level by logistic regression. results: in the total patient group (gagp + cp), the adjusted odds ratio (or) of periodontitis was decreased in cases who were carriers of hla-b*57 (or = 0.259, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.086 to 0.782), hla-dqb1*08 (or = 0.404, 95% ci = 0.187 to 0.871), or the combination hla-drb1*04;drb4*;dqb1*0302 (or = 0.407, 95% ci = 0.185 to 0.895). moreover, individuals who expressed hla-drb1*04 (or = 0.36, 95% ci = 0.148 to 0.886) or hla-drb1*04;drb4*;dqb1*0302 (or = 0.29, 95% ci = 0.092 to 0.884) had a  decreased colonization risk with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: certain hla markers were negatively associated to the manifestation  of a generalized periodontitis and/or the individual colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the underlying mechanisms have to be investigated in future studies.

TI  == increased levels of porphyromonas gingivalis are associated with ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease in humans: an in vivo study.
AB  == objective: this study investigated the role of periodontal disease in the development of stroke or cerebral infarction in patients by evaluating the clinical periodontal conditions and the subgingival levels of periodontopathogens. material and methods: twenty patients with ischemic (i-cva)  or hemorrhagic (h-cva) cerebrovascular episodes (test group) and 60 systemically  healthy patients (control group) were evaluated for: probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing and plaque index. porphyromonas gingivalis  and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were both identified and quantified in  subgingival plaque samples by conventional and real-time pcr, respectively. results: the test group showed a significant increase in each of the following parameters: pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, bleeding on probing, plaque index and number of missing teeth when compared to control values (p<0.05, unpaired t-test). likewise, the test group had increased numbers of sites that were contaminated with p. gingivalis (60%x10%; p<0.001; chi-squared test) and displayed greater prevalence of periodontal disease, with an odds ratio of 48.06  (95% ci: 5.96-387.72; p<0.001). notably, a positive correlation between probing depth and the levels of p. gingivalis in ischemic stroke was found (r=0.60; p=0.03; spearman's rank correlation coefficient test). a. actinomycetemcomitans dna was not detected in any of the groups by conventional or real-time pcr. conclusions: stroke patients had deeper pockets, more severe attachment loss, increased bleeding on probing, increased plaque indexes, and in their pockets harbored increased levels of p. gingivalis. these findings suggest that periodontal disease is a risk factor for the development of cerebral hemorrhage or infarction. early treatment of periodontitis may counteract the development of cerebrovascular episodes.

TI  == microbial profiles of patients seeking treatment for periodontitis. influence of  origin, smoking and age?
AB  == purpose: we assessed the potential influence of the origin, the smoking status and the age on subgingival microbial profiles of subjects seeking periodontal care in switzerland today. material and methods: subgingival samples were obtained from 182 subjects originating from 44 countries (56 native swiss, 64 other european, 43 african, 19 others), seeking periodontal treatment at the school of dental medicine at the university of geneva. four periodontal microorganisms were quantified by direct hybridization with specific rna probes.  results: tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were ubiquitous (95.6%, 93.9%), and porphyromonas gingivalis was frequently detected (89%). counts correlated with the size of the microbial sample (total load). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only 70 (38.4%) subjects. counts were highly variable and unrelated to total load. subjects less than 46.8 years old (median age) had a higher risk to be positive than older subjects. detection frequencies and counts of all four organisms were unrelated to the origin or the  smoking status. conclusions: based on a clinical diagnosis of untreated periodontitis, positive outcomes of tests for t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. gingivalis could be predicted with high confidence irrespective of a patient;'s origin, smoking status or age. detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans was less frequent and depended on the age of the subject.

TI  == periodontal vaccine.
AB  == vaccine is the name applied generally to a substance of the nature of dead or attenuated living infectious material introduced into the body with the object of increasing its power to resist or get rid of a disease. vaccines are generally prophylactic, i.e. they ameliorate the effects of future infection. one such vaccine considered here is the "periodontal vaccine". till date, no preventive modality exists for periodontal disease and treatment rendered is palliative. thus, availability of periodontal vaccine would not only prevent and modulate periodontal disease, but also enhance the quality of life of people for whom periodontal treatment cannot be easily obtained. the aim of the research should be development of a multispecies vaccine targeting the four prime periodontal pathogens, viz. porphyromonas gingivalis, t. forsythus, t. denticola and a. comitans. success is still elusive in case of periodontal vaccine due to the complex etiopathogenesis of the disease.

AB  == objectives: this randomized split-mouth clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of scaling and root planing associated to the high-intensity diode laser on periodontal therapy by means of clinical parameters and microbial reduction. materials and methods: a total of 36 chronic periodontitis subjects, of both genders, were selected. one pair of contralateral single-rooted teeth with pocket depth >5 mm was chosen from each subject. all patients received non-surgical periodontal treatment, after which the experimental teeth were designated to either test or control groups. both teeth received scaling, root planing and coronal polishing (srp) and teeth assigned to the test group (srp + dl) were irradiated with the 808 +/- 5 nm diode laser, for 20 s, in two isolated  appointments, 1 week apart. the laser was used in the continuous mode, with 1.5 w and power density of 1,193.7 w/cm(2). clinical and microbiological data were collected at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months after therapy. results: there was a significant improvement of all the clinical parameters-clinical attachment level  (cal), probing depth (pd), plaque index (pi) and bleeding on probing (bop)-for both groups (p < 0.001), with no statistical difference between them at the 6 weeks and the 6 months examinations. as for microbiological analysis, a significant reduction after 6 weeks (p > 0.05) was observed as far as colony forming units (cfu) is concerned, for both groups. as for black-pigmented bacteria, a significant reduction was observed in both groups after 6 months. however, the difference between test and control groups was not significant. there was no association between group and presence of porphyromonas gingivalis,  prevotella intermedia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans at any time of the study. conclusions: after 6 months of evaluation, the high-intensity diode laser has not shown any additional benefits to the conventional periodontal treatment. clinical relevance: the high intensity diode laser did not provide additional benefits to non-surgical periodontal treatment. more studies are necessary to prove the actual need of this type of laser in the periodontal clinical practice.

TI  == comparative evaluation of the effects of different photoablative laser irradiation protocols on the gingiva of periodontopathic patients.
AB  == objective: we aimed at quantifying the presence of periodontopathogens in gingival biopsies from periodontitis patients treated with different photoablative lasers (diode gaas, er:yag, nd:yag, and co(2) lasers) and histologically analyzing their effects on the gingiva. background data: substantial evidence indicates that intracellular location of periodontal bacteria in the gingival epithelium may contribute to chronic periodontitis. methods: sixteen adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were subjected to conventional scaling/root planing and topical chlorhexidine, and immediately laser-irradiated on the inner and outer free gingiva. small gingival biopsies were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction and cytofluorescence to identify periodontopathogens; tissue damage and endothelial icam-1 expression were assessed by histological and immunofluorescence analyses. results: high dna  levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and ekenella corrodens, were detected in all samples. nd:yag and diode lasers were capable of  eradicating periodontopathogenic bacteria endowed within gingival epithelial cells outside periodontal pockets, without causing connective tissue damage and microvessel rupture. they also reduced icam-1 immunolabelling by the vascular endothelium. conversely, er:yag lasers induced marked microvessel rupture and bleeding and failed to completely and selectively ablate the infected gingival epithelium, whereas co(2) laser caused heat-induced coagulation of the lamina propria. conclusions: this study indicates that periodontopathogens can persist within cells outside the pocket epithelium, despite conventional periodontal treatment. nd:yag and diode lasers are able to eradicate intra- and extracellular bacteria from these sites, suggesting that they can be considered suitable devices to improve the clinical outcome of periodontal disease.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

AB  == objective: this study was to longitudinally evaluate the change of prevalence of  five periodontal putative pathogens in the subgingival plaque of artificial class iii furcation defects at the three time-points, including before the establishment of furcation defects, before and 6 months after periodontal surgery. methods: eighteen chronic infected class iii fi defects were created at  the mandibular first molars, second molars and second premolars of three adult male macaca fascicularis. the samples of subgingival plaque were obtained from the subgingival area of furcation defects in buccal and lingual sites before the  establishment of furcation defects, before and 6 months after periodontal surgery. 36 samples were obtained at one time-points. five periodontal putative pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema dinticola (td), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), were detected with 16srrna based pcr. results: 1. the prevalence of pg, tf, td and fn was gradually increased, from 58.3% to 69.4%  to 88.9%, 47,2% to 69.4% to 83.3%, 13.9% to 36.1% to 61.1% (p<0.01), and 69.4% to 91.7% to 91.7% (p<0.05), respectively during the experimental period. the prevalence of fn was higher than pg, tf and td. the prevalence of aa was the lowest and no obvious difference among the three samplings(from 25.9% to 13.9% to 33.3%)was detected. 2. the prevalence of more than 3 species simultaneously detected was increased from 38.9% to 61.1% to 83.3% (p <0.01). the red complex (pg + tf + td) was detected from 8.3% to 27.8% to 44.4% (p<0.01) at the different time point. 3. the combined detection frequency of red complex in the inflammatory sites (87.5%), which were histologically defined as inflammatory cells infiltrated in furcation area 6 months post-surgery, and the same sites pre-surgery (62.5%) was more than that in pre-creation of furcation defects (p<0.01). but there were no significant differences compared to that in non inflammatory area (60.0%, 40.0%), respectively. conclusion: the prevalence of periodontal pathogenic bacteria correlated with the severity of local inflammation. the increase of coexistent rate of red complex at the second and third sampling times suggests that the red complex play important role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. fn may be a resident bacteria in the subgingival plaque, play a bridge role on the biofilm formation and maturation. aa may not be a major causative bacteria in the clinical periodontitis.

TI  == effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == azithromycin as an adjunctive treatment of generalized severe chronic periodontitis: clinical, microbiologic, and biochemical parameters.
AB  == background: this study examines the efficacy of azithromycin in combination with  non-surgical periodontal therapy on clinical and microbiologic parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) matrix metalloproteinases-8 (mmp-8) levels over 6 months in patients with severe generalized chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: twenty-eight of 36 patients with severe generalized cp were included in this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study. they were randomly assigned to azithromycin or placebo groups (500 mg, once daily for 3 days). probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level, dichotomous presence or absence of supragingival plaque accumulation, and bleeding on probing were recorded. gcf samples were obtained from one single-rooted tooth with pd >/= 6 mm, whereas microbiologic samples were collected from two single-rooted teeth with pd >/= 6 mm. microbiologic parameters were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and total bacteria. gcf mmp-8 levels were determined by immunofluorescence assay. results: azithromycin and placebo groups demonstrated similar but significant improvements in all clinical parameters (p <0.05). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia, and total bacteria significantly decreased over the 6-month period in both groups, whereas  f. nucleatum was significantly reduced in all visits in the azithromycin group, with the levels also being lower compared with those of the placebo group (p <0.05). the azithromycin and placebo groups exhibited significant reduction in gcf mmp-8 levels at the post-treatment visit and at 2 weeks (p <0.05). conclusion: on the basis of the present findings, it can be concluded that adjunctive azithromycin provides no additional benefit over non-surgical periodontal treatment on parameters investigated in patients with severe generalized cp.

TI  == a comparative evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of honey in vitro and antiplaque efficacy in a 4-day plaque regrowth model in vivo: preliminary results.
AB  == background: honey has a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial action that may make  it suitable for "anti-infective" treatment of periodontal disease. the aims of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of honey against oral bacteria and compare the same with 0.2% chlorhexidine; and 2) to compare antiplaque efficacy in vivo with chlorhexidine. methods: the study was conducted in two parts. in the in vitro part, the inhibitory effects of three test agents, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, honey mouthwash, and saline, against six oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512  mug/ml were tested in duplicate. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was set as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. the in vivo part consisted of a double-masked parallel clinical trial based on a 4-day plaque regrowth model. sixty-six volunteers, 20 to 24 years of age, participated in the study, and the plaque scores were compared at baseline and at the end of 4 days. the kruskal-wallis test was used for significance, and the mann-whitney u test was used for pairwise comparison of the groups. the mean plaque scores were 1.77 +/- 0.86, 1.64 +/- 0.90, and 3.27 +/- 0.83 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. results: the honey mouthrinse effectively inhibited the six tested microorganisms. the chlorhexidine gluconate  rinse had the lowest mics compared with honey and saline rinses for all test species examined. the in vivo results revealed that plaque formation was inhibited/reduced by chlorhexidine and honey rinses. conclusion: honey has antibacterial action against tested oral microorganisms and also has antiplaque action.

TI  == detection of periodontal bacteria in thrombi of patients with acute myocardial infarction by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == backgrounds: numerous reports have demonstrated that periodontal bacteria are present in plaques from atherosclerotic arteries. although periodontitis has recently been recognized as a risk factor for coronary artery disease, the direct relationship between periodontal bacteria and coronary artery disease has not yet been clarified. it has been suggested that these bacteria might contribute to inflammation and plaque instability. we assumed that if periodontal bacteria induce inflammation of plaque, the bacteria would be released into the bloodstream when vulnerable plaque ruptures. to determine whether periodontal bacteria are present in thrombi at the site of acute myocardial infarction, we tried to detect periodontal bacteria in thrombi of patients with acute myocardial infarction by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: we studied 81 consecutive adults with st-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). all patients underwent removal  of thrombus with aspiration catheters at the beginning of percutaneous coronary intervention, and a small sample of thrombus was obtained for pcr. results: the detection rates of periodontal bacteria by pcr were 19.7% for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, 3.4% for porphyromonas gingivalis, and 2.3% for treponema  denticola. conclusions: three species of periodontal bacteria were detected in the thrombi of patients with acute myocardial infarction. this raises the possibility that such bacteria are latently present in plaque and also suggests that these bacteria might have a role in plaque inflammation and instability.

TI  == no association between a actinomycetemcomitans or p gingivalis and chronic or aggressive periodontitis diagnosis.
AB  == objectives: only a few studies have attempted to detect differences in microbiologic profiles of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) and aggressive periodontitis (agp). the aim of this analysis was to assess if clinical diagnosis or other subject factors showed association with the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in a cohort of periodontitis patients. method and materials: statistical analysis for association between bacterial detection and clinical diagnosis was performed on a total of 267 consecutive periodontitis cases diagnosed with either cp (n = 183) or agp (n = 84). all subjects had microbiologic samples collected from the four deepest pockets and analyzed by nested polymerase chain reaction. results: a actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 54% and 48% of cp and agp subjects, respectively. a slightly higher detection of p gingivalis was found in cp (67% )  compared with agp (52%) cases. the detection of p gingivalis was associated with  older age (p = .002), less disease severity (p = .015), and il6-1480 genotypes (p = .026), while a actinomycetemcomitans was associated with il6-1480 genotypes (p  = .001). conclusion: detection of known periodontopathogenic bacteria is not able to discriminate different forms of periodontitis.

TI  == the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole improves clinical and microbiologic results of one-stage, full-mouth, ultrasonic debridement in aggressive periodontitis treatment.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study is to assess clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic benefits of amoxicillin/metronidazole (am) when performing full-mouth ultrasonic debridement (fmud) in generalized aggressive periodontitis  (gagp) treatment. methods: twenty-four gagp patients were divided into two groups: the fmud group (n = 12), which received fmud plus placebo, and the fmud+am group (n = 12), which received fmud and 375 mg amoxicillin plus 250 mg metronidazole for 7 days. the following clinical outcomes were tested: plaque and bleeding on probing indices, pocket probing depth (pd), relative gingival margin  position (gmp), and relative clinical attachment level (cal). total amount of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) concentration of interleukin (il)-10 and il-1beta were also determined. all clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters were assessed at baseline and at 3 and  6 months post-therapy. the anova/tukey test was used for statistical analysis (alpha = 5%). results: amoxicillin/metronidazole used as an adjunct to the fmud protocol added clinical and microbiologic benefits to gagp treatment (p <0.05). fmud+am groups presented an additional pd reduction in initially deep pds at the  3-month follow-up (3.99 +/- 1.16 mm and 3.09 +/- 0.78 mm for fmud+am and fmud, respectively; p <0.05), a lower number of residual pockets at the 3- and 6-month  follow-ups, and a statistical reduction in amounts of aa (p <0.05). analysis of tf and pg amounts, as well as il-10 and il-1beta gcf concentrations failed to demonstrate a difference between the groups (p >0.05). conclusion: it may be concluded that amoxicillin/metronidazole improves clinical and microbiologic results of fmud in gagp treatment.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == periodontal pathogens affect the level of protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == in periodontitis, an effective host-response is primarily related to neutrophils  loaded with serine proteases, including elastase (ne) and protease 3 (pr3), the extracellular activity of which is tightly controlled by endogenous inhibitors. in vitro these inhibitors are degraded by gingipains, cysteine proteases produced by porphyromonas gingivalis. the purpose of this study was to determine the level of selected protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in relation to periodontal infection. the gcf collected from 31 subjects (nine healthy controls, seven with gingivitis, five with aggressive periodontitis and 10 with chronic periodontitis) was analyzed for the levels of elafin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), two main tissue-derived inhibitors of neutrophil serine proteases. in parallel, activity of ne, pr3 and arginine-specific gingipains (rgps) in gcf was measured. finally loads of p. gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were determined. the highest values of elafin were found in aggressive  periodontitis and the lowest in controls. the quantity of elafin correlated positively with the load of p. gingivalis, ta. forsythia and tr. denticola, as well as with rgps activity. in addition, ne activity was positively associated with the counts of those bacterial species, but not with the amount of elafin. in contrast, the highest concentrations of slpi were found in periodontally healthy  subjects whereas amounts of this inhibitor were significantly decreased in patients infected with p. gingivalis. periodontopathogenic bacteria stimulate the release of ne and pr3, which activities escape the control through degradation of locally produced inhibitors (slpi and elafin) by host-derived and bacteria-derived proteases.

TI  == release of metronidazole from electrospun poly(l-lactide-co-d/l-lactide) fibers for local periodontitis treatment.
AB  == objectives: we aimed to achieve detailed biomaterials characterization of a drug  delivery system for local periodontitis treatment based on electrospun metronidazole-loaded resorbable polylactide (pla) fibers. methods: pla fibers loaded with 0.1-40% (w/w) mna were electrospun and were characterized by sem and  dsc. hplc techniques were used to analyze the release profiles of metronidazole (mna) from these fibers. the antibacterial efficacy was determined by measuring inhibition zones of drug-containing aliquots from the same electrospun fiber mats in an agar diffusion test. three pathogenic periodontal bacterial strains: fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas  gingivalis were studied. cytotoxicity testing was performed with human gingival fibroblasts by: (i) counting viable cells via live/dead staining methods and (ii) by exposing cells directly onto the surface of mna-loaded fibers. results: mna concentration influenced fiber diameters and thus w/w surface areas: diameter being minimal and area maximal at 20% mna. hplc showed that these 20% mna fibers  had the fastest initial mna release. from the third day, mna release was slower and nearly linear with time. all fiber mats released 32-48% of their total drug content within the first 7 days. aliquots of media taken from the fiber mats inhibited the growth of all three bacterial strains. mna released up to the 28th  day from fiber mats containing 40% mna significantly decreased the viability of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis and up to the 2nd day also for the resistant a. actinomycetemcomitans. all of the investigated fibers and aliquots showed excellent cytocompatibility. significance: this study shows that mna-loaded electrospun fiber mats represent an interesting class of resorbable drug delivery systems. sustained drug release properties and cytocompatibility suggest their potential clinical applicability for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == investigation and quantification of key periodontal pathogens in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background and objective: diabetes is a recognized risk factor for periodontitis. there are conflicting data regarding whether healthy diabetic patients or diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis have an altered subgingival microbiota compared with nondiabetic individuals. the aim of the present study was to detect quantitative differences in selected periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaque of diabetic patients using taqman quantitative pcr. material and methods: type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with (n=9) or without chronic periodontal disease (n=15) were recruited and matched to nondiabetic control subjects (n=12 periodontally healthy, n=12 chronic periodontitis). subgingival plaque samples were collected from deep (>4 mm probing depth) and shallow sites (</=3 mm probing depth) using paper points, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were  quantified. results: forty-eight subjects (69 samples) were recruited. marked differences were seen in the levels of all three bacterial species, relative to the total bacterial population, according to periodontal health status. using real-time quantitative pcr, bacterial counts for p. gingivalis were significantly higher in deep pockets of diabetic and nondiabetic subjects compared with periodontally healthy subjects (p<0.05) but did not differ significantly between  diabetics and nondiabetics. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in all groups in low quantities, and counts did not differ significantly between groups (p>0.05). f. nucleatum was abundant in all groups, with no clear significant differences between groups. p. gingivalis was found in higher quantities in periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p<0.05). statistically significant positive correlations were identified between pocket depth and counts for all three species tested (p<0.05). conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis were present in significantly different quantities and proportions in subgingival plaque, according to periodontal disease status. no significant differences were identified between the subgingival microbiota of  type 2 diabetes mellitus patients compared with nondiabetic subjects.

TI  == evidence for graft colonization with periodontal pathogens in lung transplant recipients. a pilot study.
AB  == bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (bos) is a major cause of late graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. there is increasing evidence that beside alloimmunologic injury also non-alloimmunologic inflammatory conditions may raise the risk of acute and chronic rejection. the oral cavity represents a possible reservoir for pathogenic bacteria due to its close anatomical proximity. in this pilot study, the presence of pathogenic periodontal bacteria in the oral  cavity as well as in the lungs of lung transplant recipients was investigated for the first time. eight lung transplant recipients underwent broncho-alveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsies, and endobronchial biopsies. in addition to routinely performed examinations, pulmonary as well as plaque samples were assessed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and treponema denticola (td) with the aid of a hybridization technique. no or only one periodontal pathogen (solitarily pg) was found in the gingival plaques of five of the eight patients (group a). in three patients, two or more periodontal pathogens were detetectable in the gingival samples (group b). whereas group a also had not more than one periodontal pathogen in the lungs, group b had more than one species in the lungs. in group b, all patients suffered from bos, whereas in group a only one patient was affected. this is the first evidence for the presence of periodontal  pathogens in the lungs of lung transplant recipients. further studies with larger cohorts are required to elucidate potential links between periodontal infection,  pulmonary colonization, and rejection.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == trefoil factors in saliva and gingival tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: trefoil factors (tffs) are secreted molecules that are involved in cytoprotection against tissue damage and the immune response. tffs have been detected in saliva and oral tissues, but their clinical significance has never been investigated in patients with chronic periodontitis. the objective of this study is to determine whether tff expression in saliva and gingival tissues is associated with periodontal pathology. methods: saliva and gingival tissue samples were collected from 25 non-periodontitis individuals and 25 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical methods were used to evaluate the expression of tffs (tff1, tff2, and tff3) in saliva and gingival tissues, respectively. periodontopathic bacteria were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: reduced salivary tff1 and tff3 concentrations were observed in patients with cp (p = 0.003 and p <0.001, respectively). decreased tff3 expression in gingival tissues  of patients with cp was demonstrated (p = 0.041). levels of salivary tff3 concentrations were negatively correlated with periodontal pathology and number of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (formerly known as bacteroides forsythus). conclusions: altered expression of tffs in saliva and gingival tissues was detected in patients with cp. the results suggest that tff3  may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.

TI  == [enteric gram negative rods and unfermented of glucose bacteria in patients with  peri-implant disease].
AB  == introduction: implants can be colonized by microorganisms from oral biofilms and  may affect peri-implant tissues health. among these bacteria, pathogens typically associated with periodontitis can be found, such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, as well as gram negative enteric bacilli not typically associated with periodontal diseases. objective: superinfecting bacteria were characterized from peri-implant lesions in patients  with history of periodontitis. materials and methods: sixty-eight implants were studied in 55 patients; the average patient age was 56 years. forty-nine implants had peri-implant lesions and 19 were considered stable. subgingival samples were  obtained in affected and stable implants. the samples were streaked on mac-conkey agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. the colonies were identified with the kit-bd bbl crystal e/nf(r). results: superinfecting organisms were detected in 20 patients--they were seen more frequently at diseased implants (n=15) than at healthy implants (n=5). the prevalence of superinfecting bacteria  on the selected implants was 33.8% (n=23/68). these bacteria were more prevalent  among affected implants (n=17 or 25%) than those with stable implants n=6 (8.8%). klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent gram negative rod detected (n=12). conclusions: one-third of the implants had superinfecting organisms. implants with a peri-implant lesion had a higher frequency of superinfecting bacteria. klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common superinfecting organism isolated. a multiple infection caused by superinfecting bacteria was present only at diseased implants. these microbial agents potentially affect implant stability.

TI  == antimicrobial advances in treating periodontal diseases.
AB  == antibiotics are generally an efficient means of treating bacterial infections, and therefore are an obvious candidate in the treatment of periodontal diseases.  systemically and locally administered antimicrobial agents of all kinds have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials. the vast majority of studies have tested antibiotics as adjuncts to non-surgical debridement. no regime has demonstrated superiority over systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole in the treatment of any clinically or microbiologically defined variant of periodontal disease. the frequency and consequences of adverse effects of antibiotics have always to be balanced against the potential consequences of not rapidly suppressing a periodontal infection. proposed strategies to reduce the risk of bacterial antimicrobial resistance include: prescribing two drugs with a synergistic or complementary effect, the administration of antibiotics at a high  dose for a short period, a combined approach with mechanical debridement to disrupt biofilms, and the focus on therapeutic rather than prophylactic use. derivatives of existing antibiotic classes and new compounds that act on unique targets are the subject of preclinical investigations with a focus on action against antibiotic-resistant medical pathogens. in light of the excellent results of a combination therapy with well-established drugs that are cheap and efficient, clinical trials should compare newly proposed protocols for periodontal therapy to a positive control. future studies should focus not only on the action against the microorganisms directly involved in periodontal diseases, but also on those relevant to other medical concerns.

TI  == animal models to study host-bacteria interactions involved in periodontitis.
AB  == animal models have distinct advantages because they can mimic cellular complexities that occur in humans in vivo and are often more accurate than in vitro studies that take place on plastic surfaces with limited numbers of cell types present. furthermore, cause and effect relationships can be established by  applying inhibitors or activators or through the use of genetically modified animals. such gain or loss of function studies are often difficult to achieve in  human clinical studies, particularly in obtaining target tissue due to important  ethical considerations. animal models in periodontal disease are particularly important at this point in the development of the scientific basis for understanding the predominant pathological processes. periodontal disease can be  broken down into discrete steps, each of which may be studied separately depending upon the animal model. these steps involve the development of a pathogenic biofilm, invasion of connective tissue by bacteria or their products,  induction of a destructive host response in connective tissue and limitation of are pair process that follows tissue breakdown. animal studies can test hypotheses related to each of these steps, and should be evaluated by their capacity to test a specific hypothesis rather than recapitulating all aspects of  periodontal disease. thus, each of the models described below can be adapted to test discrete components of the pathological process of periodontal disease, but  not necessarily all of them.

TI  == associations of periodontal microorganisms with salivary proteins and mmp-8 in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objective: we investigated in subjects with and without periodontitis, the levels of certain salivary proteins and matrix metalloproteinase-8 (mmp-8) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), in relation to the presence of specific periodontal pathogens. methods: clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, in 1985 and in 2009 from 99 subjects; 56 with and 43 without periodontitis (mean age 59.2 +/- sd 2.9). saliva samples collected in 2009 were analysed for salivary albumin, total  protein and immunoglobulins a, g and m. gcf was collected for analysis of mmp-8 levels and for the pcr-analysis of the microorganisms aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia. results: periodontitis patients were more often infected by p. gingivalis (p < 0.05), p. intermedia and t. denticola (p = 0.01) than controls. salivary albumin and protein concentrations were significantly higher in subjects with t. denticola (p < 0.05). mmp-8 levels were  significantly higher in subjects with t. denticola (p < 0.001) and t. forsythia (p < 0.01). no corresponding results were found in salivary immunoglobulin concentrations. conclusion: the presence of t. denticola seemed to increase salivary albumin and total protein concentrations, and gcf levels of mmp-8. both  t. denticola and t. forsythia seemed to induce a cascade of host response with increased mmp-8 in gcf.

TI  == the effect of spiramycin on porphyromonas gingivalis and other "classic" periopathogens.
AB  == in clinical trials, spiramycin has shown additional benefit overscaling and root  planing on pocket depth reduction, but its effect on periodontal microbiota was evaluated only by darkfield microscopy. therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of spiramycin administration on porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria using 16s rarn pcr technique. thirty two non-smoker adults with untreated periodontitis and pocket depth > or = 7 mm. were evaluated to participate in this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. clinical measurements were performed on day -15, 15, 30 and 90 from baseline. subgingival samples were analyzed for detection of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tj), treponema denticola (td) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) on days -15, 30 and 90. on day 0, 25 pg positive subjects were randomly assigned to receive either systemically administered spiramycinfor 7 days (test group sp) or identical placebo tablets (placebo group  pl). after spiramycin administration pg, tf and td were suppressed showingstatistically significant difference (p<0.05) with the placebo group. none of the groups showed changes in aa detection. these data indicate that bacteria currently associated with advanced periodontitis (pg, tf and td) are suppressed after 7 days of systemic administration of spiramycin.

TI  == effect of a self-etching adhesive containing an antibacterial monomer on clinical periodontal parameters and subgingival microbiologic composition in orthodontic patients.
AB  == introduction: the aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of a self-etching adhesive system containing an antibacterial monomer on periodontal health and subgingival microbiologic composition in orthodontic patients and to compare it with a conventional adhesive system. methods: a split-mouth design was chosen, and 15 patients were included in the study. brackets in contralateral quadrants were bonded with either a conventional adhesive system (control) or a self-etching adhesive system that contained an antibacterial monomer. clinical periodontal parameters including plaque index, gingival index, probing depths, and bleeding on probing were determined. subgingival plaque samples were collected before bracket placement (t0) and at the 6-month follow-up (t1). the real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction assay was used to determine the subgingival counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and campylobacter rectus. for clinical periodontal parameters, analysis of covariance (ancova) and, for bacterial counts, wilcoxon tests were used for statistical comparisons at the p <0.05 level. results: clinical periodontal parameters were not changed, and they were not different between the  groups from t0 to t1. t forsythensis and f nucleatum increased during the treatment period in both groups (p <0.05). the majority of the bacteria were t nucleatum at t0 and t1 in both groups. changes in bacterial load from t0 to t1 were not different between groups except for t forsythensis and f nucleatum (p <0.05). conclusions: the use of an antibacterial monomer did not have an additional positive effect on clinical periodontal parameters. when used in bonding orthodontic brackets, the antibacterial monomer failed to reduce periodontopathogenic bacteria when compared with the conventional adhesive system during a 6-month treatment period.

TI  == salivary levels of antibacterial peptide (ll-37/hcap-18) and cotinine in patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between salivary ll-37 levels and clinical severity in patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). the presence/absence of four periodontopathic bacteria and salivary cotinine levels were also examined to assess the impact of these factors on ll-37 production. methods: unstimulated salivary samples were collected from 69 patients with cp. salivary concentrations of ll-37 and cotinine were measured  by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in saliva were detected by polymerase chain reaction. periodontal examination included determination of probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, and plaque control record. results: mean salivary ll-37 concentration was 225.0 +/- 227.2 ng/ml, and a high prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was observed. the stepwise ordinal logistic regression model showed that high salivary ll-37 levels were significantly associated with the presence of t. denticola and higher percentage of teeth with pd >/=5 mm. in addition, higher salivary cotinine levels (>/=8 ng/ml) were negatively associated with salivary ll-37 levels. conclusions: salivary ll-37 level was positively correlated with severe periodontal destruction, and production was apparently associated with periodontopathic bacterial infection. the negative correlations between salivary  ll-37 and cotinine levels also suggest that smoking or long-term exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can lead to lower ll-37 levels in the oral cavity and increased risk of periodontitis.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. we also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by pcr invader technology. detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by pcr. fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. results: detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01). detection rate of f. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. a positive correlation was observed between dna quantification of p. gingivalis and number of candida species in saliva. cluster analysis of the test  species identified two clusters. tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque  status was associated with the detection rate of t. denticola and f. nucleatum. conclusion: results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by t. denticola and f. nucleatum.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == diode laser activated indocyanine green selectively kills bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: commercially available photodynamic therapy for periodontal diseases utilizes methylene blue as a photosensitizer. here we propose a novel photosensitizer dye, indocyanine green (icg), because it can be readily activated by commercially available dental 810 nm diode lasers and has an established safety record as an intravascular agent in cardiac imaging and ophthalmologic photodynamic therapy. therefore, we aim to characterize icg uptake and killing of key periodontal pathogens to explore its potential as a periodontal photodynamic therapy agent. materials and methods: we tested icg uptake by spectroscopy in porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, in addition to escherichia coli dh5alpha and a human gingival epithelial cell line, hepg, in relation to icg dose and exposure time. we then measured killing of bacteria by determining viable bacteria counts before and after exposure to icg and 810 nm diode laser light (0-0.5 w output settings,  0-5 seconds). icg was also applied to extracted, restored teeth, and the teeth inspected visually for staining after rinsing with saline. results: we found rapid and significant uptake of indocyanine green into p. gingivalis 381 and a. actinomycetemcomitans 67, compared to e. coli dh5alpha and hepg gingival cell line. this correlated with significant killing of strains 381 and 67 compared to  e.coli, with less than 10% survival. icg does not appear to stain tooth surfaces  and materials except calculus. conclusion: icg combined with an 810 nm diode laser may be useful as a photodynamic adjunct for reduction of bacterial load in  periodontal pockets.

AB  == objective: to investigate the impact on microbiologic variables of full-mouth scaling (fms) and conventional scaling and root planing (csrp) after 12 months. method and materials: in a prospective randomized controlled clinical study, 37 volunteers with moderate chronic periodontitis were treated by fms or by csrp in  two sessions at 4-week intervals. clinical attachment level, probing depth, and bleeding on probing were recorded at baseline as well as at 6 and 12 months. four subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest sites in premolars and molars at baseline and after 12 months. pooled sample analysis was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction for the identification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, the bacterial load of a actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in the csrp group compared to the  fms group (p = .042). in the csrp group, this load decreased significantly (p = .011), leading to similar quantities of a actinomycetemcomitans in both groups. further, significant reductions in frequency were found in the fms group for t forsythia and p gingivalis and in the csrp group for a actinomycetemcomitans and  t denticola. conclusion: the data suggest that both therapy modalities lead to similar effects on target periodontal pathogen species. fms compared to csrp was  not favorable in reduction of periodontopathogens.

TI  == levels of periodontal pathogens in neonatal gastric aspirates and possible maternal sites of origin.
AB  == maternal periodontal infection has been recognized as a risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants. it is suspected that pathogens causing periodontal disease may translocate to the amniotic cavity and so contribute to triggering an adverse pregnancy outcome. this study aimed to determine levels and proportions of periodontal bacteria in neonatal gastric aspirates obtained from complicated pregnancies and the respective maternal oral and vaginal samples using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach, and also to determine the origin of the neonate's bacteria by sequence comparisons between the three sites. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythia were not observed  in the neonates or in the women's vaginas. interestingly, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the neonates in two samples (2.98e+02 and 1.75e+02 cells ml(-1)) and in association with fusobacterium nucleatum, which was observed at high prevalence (10%) and at high levels reaching up to 2.32e+03 cells ml(-1). although f. nucleatum was also present in the vaginal samples, the results demonstrated that the neonatal strains were more likely to originate from the mother's oral cavity than to be vaginal strains.

AB  == isoliquiritigenin (1) and liquiritigenin (2) are structurally related flavonoids  found in a variety of plants. the purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of biological properties of these compounds in regard to their therapeutic potential for oral infections. compound 1 demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against three major periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. in  contrast, 2 exerted less pronounced effects on the above bacterial species. neither compound was effective against cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans  and streptococcus sobrinus). furthermore, 1 exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity than 2 toward p. gingivalis collagenase and human matrix metalloproteinase 9. finally, the capacity of 1 to attenuate the inflammatory response of macrophages induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (lps) was much higher when compared to 2. the activation of transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) associated with the lps-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was inhibited strongly by 1, but less affected by 2.

TI  == aerosol deposition of hydroxyapatite and 4-hexylresorcinol coatings on titanium alloys for dental implants.
AB  == purpose: aerosol deposition is a newly developed technique, and it can deliver the drug from a hydroxyapatite (ha)-coated surface. 4-hexylresorcinol (4-hr) is a well-known antiseptic. the influence of the 4-hr component of ha coatings on titanium surfaces was studied in vitro and in vivo. materials and methods: x-ray  diffraction and fourier transform infrared techniques were used for the evaluation of the coating. the cellular response of the coating was evaluated by  scanning electron microscopic study, mtt assay, alkaline phosphatase assay, and osteocalcin assay. in addition, the dental implant was coated with ha or ha + 4-hr. the implant was installed into the tibia of a rabbit after contamination by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the torque test and histologic analysis were then performed at 8 weeks after the operation. results: by use of an aerosol deposition technique, the combination of ha and 4-hr was successfully coated onto a titanium surface, which was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared techniques. mg63 cells attached more rapidly to the ha + 4-hr  coating than to the ha-only coating. the ha + 4-hr coating had significantly increased osteocalcin expression and alkaline phosphatase activity compared with  the ha-only coating (p < .05). the dental implant coated with ha + 4-hr had a significantly higher removal torque value than that coated with ha alone at 8 weeks after surgery (p < .05). on histologic analysis, both the bone formation value and the bone-to-implant contact value were significantly higher in the ha + 4-hr group than in the ha-only group at 8 weeks after surgery (p < .05). conclusions: collectively, the ha + 4-hr-coated dental implant had clear advantages over the ha-coated dental implant. therefore ha + 4-hr coatings can be considered for patients who need immediate implant installation after tooth extraction or who have poor-quality bone.

TI  == detection of periodontal markers in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim was to compare the detection frequency of periodontopathogens by using the pado test 4.5 and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique in chronic periodontitis patients.thirty patients with chronic periodontitis were tested cross-sectionally with dna/rna oligogenomic probe method (iai pado test 4.5) and  dna/dna whole genomic probe (checkerboard) method. samples were taken by two paper points at the deepest site in each of the four quadrants and pooled into one sample for each of the two methods. the samples were sent to the two laboratories (iai, zuchwil, switzerland, and oral microbiology laboratory, university of gothenburg, sweden) and were analyzed in a routine setting for the  presence and amount of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola.while pado test 4.5 detected the four periodontal pathogens in 11 (36.7%) of the patients, the checkerboard method showed presence in all patients (100%) using the lower score  (score 1 corresponding to 10(4) bacterial cells) and 16 (53.3%) using a higher treshold (score 3 corresponding to between >10(5) and 10(6) cells).the results of the present study showed low agreement for a positive microbiological outcome using the two diagnostic methods. it was also concluded that microbiological analysis in practice should include a larger number of bacterial species to better serve as markers for a diseased associated flora in chronic periodontitis  cases.

TI  == clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic factors of orthodontic treatment-induced gingival enlargement.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiologic and immunologic factors related to orthodontic treatment-induced gingival enlargement (ge). methods: our study included 12 patients with ge undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment and 12 periodontally healthy controls. at baseline, periodontal variables, subgingival plaque samples, and gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) samples were taken from 2 preselected sites in both the ge and the control  groups. the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella  forsythia were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. gcf interleukin (il)-1beta and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-beta1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (invitrogen, camarillo, calif). periodontal therapy was given to the ge group, and all parameters were reassessed after 4 weeks. results: at baseline, the ge group showed higher prevalences of the 5 periodontal pathogens than did the control group (p <0.05). il-1beta and tgf-beta1 levels at the ge sites were also significantly higher than those at the control sites (p <0.05). four weeks after periodontal therapy, the ge group showed significant improvements in the clinical parameters associated with significant reductions of p gingivalis, a actinomycetemcomitans, and t denticola. the levels of il-1beta decreased significantly compared with the baseline (p <0.05), whereas there was no significant change in tgf-beta1 levels (p >0.05). conclusions: periodontal pathogens might have a relationship with the initiation  and development of orthodontic treatment-induced ge. inflammatory cytokines (il-1beta and tgf-beta1) can also be considered as contributing factors.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == antimicrobial sesquiterpenoids from laurus nobilis l.
AB  == activity-guided fractionations of leaf extracts from laurus nobilis l. led to the isolation of a known sesquiterpene lactone, deacetyl laurenobiolide (1). compound 1 showed antimicrobial activity against periopathic pathogens (actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), opportunistic gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and fungi (candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus fumigatus). furthermore, acetylation and cyclisation of deacetyl laurenobiolide (1) yielded laurenobiolide (2) and a new compound, (5s,6r,7s,8s,10r)-6,8-dihydroxyeudesma-4(15),11(13)-dien-12-oic acid 12,8-lactone (3), respectively. compounds 2 and 3 also showed antimicrobial activities. all compounds 1-3 demonstrated growth inhibitory effects with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 31 to 1000 microg ml(-1). this is the first report of compounds 1-3 showing antimicrobial activities.

TI  == association of natural anti-platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies with periodontal disease.
AB  == platelet factor 4 (pf4) and heparin (h) form pf4/h complexes, the target of the immune reaction in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit). hit seems to be a secondary immune response as anti-pf4/h-igg antibodies occur as early as day 4 of heparin treatment. this study investigated whether prevalent infections such as periodontitis may induce the pf4/h immune response as: (1) natural anti-pf4/h abs are present in the normal population; (2) pf4 bound to bacteria exposes the same  antigen(s) as pf4/h complexes; and (3) sepsis induces pf4/h abs in mice. we found pf4 bound to periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; porphyromonas gingivalis) enabling subsequent binding of human anti-pf4/h abs. the association of natural pf4/h abs and periodontitis was assessed in a case-control study, enrolling individuals with natural anti-pf4/h abs (n = 40 matched pairs), and in the cross-sectional population-based study of health in pomerania (ship; n = 3500). both studies showed a robust association between periodontitis and presence of anti-pf4/h abs independent of inflammation markers  (case-control study: lowest vs highest tertile, odds ratio, 7.12 [95% confidence  interval, 1.73-46.13; p = .005]; ship study, p(trend) </= 0.001). thus, preimmunization to pf4/bacteria complexes by prevalent infections, for example, periodontitis, likely explains the presence of natural anti-pf4/heparin abs and the early occurrence of anti-pf4/h-igg in hit.

TI  == periodontopathogen- and host-derived immune response in acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == owing to molecular mimicry, periodontal pathogen carriage may result in a systemic cross-reactive immune response with the host. the analyses were performed to investigate if serum antibody levels to human heat shock protein 60  (hsp60) are associated with the antibody levels and salivary carriage of two periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, as well as with the dental status in patients with acute coronary syndrome (acs). acs patients (n = 141) were monitored at baseline when entering to hospital, and after 1 week, 3 months and 1 year. periodontal status was recorded by dental radiographs, and a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were detected by pcr from saliva at baseline. serum igg and iga antibody levels were determined at all time points. all antibody levels remained quite stable during the follow-up. serum igg-class antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans and hsp60 had a strong positive correlation with each other at all time points (r approximately 0.4, p < 0.05). mean serum igg antibody levels to hsp60 were significantly higher in the a. actinomycetemcomitans igg- and iga-seropositive than in the seronegative patients, but did not differ between the pathogen carriers compared to the non-carriers. hsp60 antibody levels did not differ significantly between the edentulous, non-periodontitis and periodontitis patients. despite the observed cross-reactivity in the systemic igg-class antibody response to hsp60 and a. actinomycetemcomitans, the pathogen carriage in saliva or the periodontal status did not affect the hsp60 antibody levels in acs  patients.

TI  == the pathogenic persona of community-associated oral streptococci.
AB  == the mitis group streptococci (mgs) are widespread in the oral cavity and are traditionally associated with oral health. however, these organisms have many attributes that contribute to the development of pathogenic oral communities. mgs adhere rapidly to saliva-coated tooth surfaces, thereby providing an attachment substratum for more overtly pathogenic organisms such as porphyromonas gingivalis, and the two species assemble into heterotypic communities. close physical association facilitates physiologic support, and pathogens such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans display resource partitioning to favour carbon sources generated by streptococcal metabolism. mgs exchange information with community members through a number of interspecies signalling systems including ai-2 and contact dependent mechanisms. signal transduction systems induced in p. gingivalis are based on protein dephosphorylation mediated by the tyrosine phosphatase ltp1, and converge on a luxr-family transcriptional regulator, cdhr. phenotypic responses in p. gingivalis include regulation of hemin uptake systems and gingipain activity, processes that are intimately linked to the virulence of the organism. furthermore, communities of s. gordonii with p. gingivalis or with a. actinomycetemcomitans are more pathogenic in animal models  than the constituent species alone. we propose that mgs should be considered accessory pathogens, organisms whose pathogenic potential only becomes evident in the context of a heterotypic microbial community.

TI  == the evaluation of bacterial flora in progress of peri-implant disease.
AB  == background: cumulative interceptive supportive therapy (cist) is currently used as a guideline for treating peri-implant diseases. the objectives of this study were to determine the detection rate and measure the number of periodontopathic bacteria in lesions of different cist levels and thereby characterize peri-implant disease from a bacteriological viewpoint. methods: this study included 105 patients who had both residual natural teeth and implants with peri-implant disease. a total of 105 implants were divided into levels a, b, c and d according to the cist classification. bacterial samples were collected from peri-implant pockets and four periodontopathic bacteria were measured by pcr and  pcr-invader assay. results: the number of periodontopathic bacteria increased in  line with cist level, and the detection rate was also associated with cist level. however, no difference was found in the bacterial detection rate of p. gingivalis and t. denticola between cist-b and cist-c. there was a higher detection rate of  all periodontopathic bacteria for cist-d. conclusions: the number of periodontopathic bacteria and detection rate increased as peri-implant disease advanced. however, there were no major differences in the detection rate between  cist-b and cist-c. on the other hand, a higher detection rate of periodontopathic bacteria was seen for cist-d.

TI  == clinical efficacy of subgingivally delivered 0.5% controlled release azithromycin gel in the management of chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: recent developments suggest that the local delivery of antimicrobials into periodontal pockets can improve periodontal health. azithromycin (azm) has a wide antimicrobial spectrum of action toward anaerobic bacteria as well as gram-negative bacilli. it is effective against periodontal pathogens such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the clinical effectiveness of azm at 0.5% concentration in an indigenously prepared bioabsorbable controlled release gel as an adjunct to non-surgical mechanical therapy in the treatment of chronic  periodontitis. materials and methods: thirty sites in patients with chronic periodontitis and probing depth (pd) 4-6 mm were categorized randomly into two treatment groups: scaling and root planing (srp) plus 0.5% azm gel (group 1) and  srp only (group 2). clinical evaluation was undertaken using the gingival index (gi) of loe and silness and plaque was assessed using the turesky et al. modification of quigley hein index at baseline and 21 days. pocket pd and clinical attachment level (cal) were also measured. statistical analysis: results were expressed as mean+/-standard deviation and percentages and the data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (spss version 16.0, spss,  chicago, il) software. result: both therapies resulted in significant improvements. mean reduction in gi from baseline to 21 days was 1.20+/-0.41 and 0.73+/-0.45 in group 1 and group 2, respectively. plaque index also improved through the study period in both groups, i.e., 0.86+/-0.51 in group 1 and 1.6+/-0.97 in group 2. mean pd reduced significantly with srp plus azm gel application in group 1, i.e., 2.1+/-0.91 mm as compared to 1.0+/-1.06 mm achieved with srp alone. a significant gain in mean cal gain was observed in the test group (1.8+/-0.63 mm) as compared to control group (1.0+/-1.06 mm). conclusion: although both treatment strategies seem to benefit patients, the adjunctive use of 0.5% of azm showed significant results.

TI  == efficacy of taurolidine against periodontopathic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of taurolidine was tested against periodontopathic species in comparison to chlorhexidine digluconate in the presence or absence of  serum. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), microbiocidal concentrations (mbc), as well as killing were determined against 32 different microbial strains  including 3 porphyromonas gingivalis, 3 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and 15 potentially superinfecting species with and without 25% v/v human serum. the mic(50) of taurolidine against the tested microbial strains was 0.025% and the mic(90) 0.05%. the respective values for the mbcs were 0.05% and 0.1%. addition of 25% serum (heat-inactivated) did not change the mic and mbc values of taurolidine. in contrast, mics and mbcs of chlorhexidine (chx) increased by two steps after addition of serum. taurolidine killed microorganisms in a concentration and time-dependent manner, the killing rate of 1.6% taurolidine was 99.08% +/- 2.27% in mean after 2 h. again, killing activity of taurolidine was not affected if serum was added, whereas addition of inactivated serum clearly reduced the killing rate of all selected bacterial strains by chx. therefore, taurolidine possesses antimicrobial properties which are not reduced in the presence of serum as a main component in gingival crevicular fluid and wound fluid. taurolidine may have potential as an antimicrobial agent in non-surgical and surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  == periodontopathogen and epstein-barr virus contamination affects transplanted bone volume in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: bone microbial contamination can impair osteogenesis. human herpesviruses-associated vasculitis can cause vascular damage within the osseous  graft and host. this study is conducted to substantiate specific contamination and assess the impact 6 months after sinus augmentation. methods: culture- and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were done on harvested bone  particles and unstimulated whole saliva in a group of 30 patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. patients were divided into two groups: those with and those without a history of periodontitis. radiographic evaluation was done to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and 6 months post-transplantation. results: seventeen patients had a history of periodontitis, and 13 did not. ten showed culture- and pcr-negative results and belonged to the  periodontally healthy group. the 17 patients with periodontitis showed culture- or pcr-positive results for the targeted periodontal pathogens. patients with periodontitis were 2.3 times more likely to have positive salivary epstein-barr virus type 1 (ebv-1) than those with no history of periodontitis. the likelihood  of having moderate to pronounced bone volume loss 6 months postaugmentation was 7.5 times greater in those patients presenting contamination with >/=3 specific pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, or prevotella intermedia) versus those with only one (p <0.05). the odds ratio (or) of pronounced volume loss was 16.3 times higher in those contaminated with a combination of salivary ebv-1 and >/=3 of the previously mentioned species versus only ebv-1 (p <0.05). individuals showing positive salivary ebv-1 had bone bacterial contamination associated 57% of the time. the or of having bone microbial contamination in patients with a history of periodontitis was 37.5 times higher than in individuals without periodontitis. conclusions: this study confirms contamination of bone, harvested intraorally, with key periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing sinus augmentation. specific microbial contamination can impair osteogenesis. saliva may act as a vehicle to transport ebv and other pathogens into the sinus. increased bone volume loss seems to be associated with the occurrence of specific periodontal anaerobic species, salivary ebv-1, or the combination of both.

TI  == effectiveness of ozone against periodontal pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == ozone has been proposed as an adjunct antiseptic in periodontitis therapy. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of gaseous/aqueous ozone, in comparison with that of the established antiseptic chlorhexidine digluconate (chx), against periodontal microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and parvimonas micra in planktonic or biofilm cultures were exposed, for 1 min, to gaseous ozone, aqueous ozone, chx, or phosphate-buffered saline (control). none of the agents was able to substantially reduce the a. actinomycetemcomitans count in biofilm cultures. in contrast, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. micra could be eliminated by 2% chx or by ozone gas at 53 gm(-3) . significantly greater antimicrobial effects were observed against planktonic cultures than against biofilm-associated bacteria. the rate of killing was influenced by the species of bacteria, and by the type and concentration of agent. there were no significant differences in the effectiveness of aqueous ozone (20 mug ml(-1) ) or gaseous ozone (>/= 4 gm(-3) ) compared with 2% chx but  they were more effective than 0.2% chx. therefore, high-concentrated gaseous and  aqueous ozone merit further investigation as antiseptics in periodontitis therapy. a safe system for applying gaseous ozone into the periodontal pocket that avoids inhalation still needs to be developed.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == interaction of oral bacteria with gingival epithelial cell multilayers.
AB  == primary gingival epithelial cells were cultured in multilayers as a model for the study of interactions with oral bacteria associated with health and periodontal disease. multilayers maintained at an air-liquid interface in low-calcium medium  displayed differentiation and cytokeratin properties characteristic of junctional epithelium. multilayers were infected with fluorescently labeled porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum or streptococcus gordonii, and bacterial association was determined by confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. porphyromonas gingivalis invaded intracellularly and spread from cell to cell; a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum remained extracellular and showed intercellular movement through the multilayer; whereas s. gordonii remained extracellular and predominantly associated with the superficial cell layer. none of the bacterial species disrupted barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance.  p. gingivalis did not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. however, a.  actinomycetemcomitans and s. gordonii induced interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), il-6 and il-8 secretion; and f. nucleatum stimulated production of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii, but not p. gingivalis, increased levels of apoptosis after 24 h infection. the results indicate that the organisms with pathogenic potential were able to traverse the epithelium, whereas the commensal bacteria did not. in addition, distinct host responses characterized the interaction between the junctional epithelium and oral bacteria.

TI  == dendritic cells, antibodies reactive with oxldl, and inflammation.
AB  == periodontitis appears to promote chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, but relevant mechanisms need clarification. oral bacteria induce antibodies that bind not only bacteria, but also oxldl. porphyromonas gingivalis  and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans induce remarkable igg responses that are dominated by igg2, and igg2 is ifn-gamma-dependent and is promoted by dendritic cells (dcs). ldl-reactive antibodies induced by p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans include anti-phosphorylcholine (alpha-pc) and beta2-glycoprotein-1-dependent anticardiolipin (alpha-cl), and these antibodies may link chronic inflammatory diseases at a mechanistic level. antibody-mediated  uptake of oxldl or bacteria dramatically enhances dc-il-12, and dc-il-12 induces  nk-cell-ifn-gamma responses that promote th-1 responses and sustained inflammation. dcs may be derived from monocytes, and this is striking in cultures of aggressive periodontitis (agp) monocytes, where dc numbers are about double control levels. moreover, serum alpha-cl levels in individuals with agp are frequently elevated, and these antibodies promote atherosclerosis in persons with antiphospholipid syndrome. elevated serum levels of soluble-intercellular adhesion molecule, soluble-vascular cell adhesion molecule, and soluble-e-selectin are atherosclerosis-associated indicators of vascular inflammation, and these markers are elevated in the subset of agp patients with high alpha-cl. we reason that periodontitis patients with elevated antibodies reactive with oxldl could be a subgroup at high risk for cardiovascular sequelae.

TI  == can oral pathogens influence allergic disease?
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis contends that fewer opportunities for infections and microbial exposures have resulted in more widespread asthma and atopic disease. consistent with that hypothesis, decreases in infectious oral diseases over the past half century have coincided with increases in the prevalence of asthma and other allergic diseases. this observation has led some researchers to speculate that exposures to oral bacteria, including pathogens associated with periodontal  diseases, such as gingivitis and periodontitis, might play a protective role in the development of asthma and allergy. colonization of the oral cavity with bacteria, including some species of periodontal pathogens, begins shortly after birth, and the detection of serum antibodies to oral pathogens in early childhood provides evidence of an early immune response to these bacteria. current knowledge of the immune response to oral bacteria and the immunologic pathogenesis of periodontal diseases suggests biologically plausible mechanisms by which oral pathogens could influence the risk of allergic disease. however, studies investigating the association between oral pathogen exposures and allergic disease are few in number and limited by cross-sectional or case-control design, exclusion of young children, and use of surrogate measures of oral bacterial colonization. additional studies, particularly well-designed case-control studies among very young children and prospective birth cohort studies, are needed.

TI  == periodontal conditions and prevalence of putative periodontopathogens and candida spp. in insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic patients with chronic  periodontitis--a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: the aims of this study were to evaluate periodontal conditions and identify the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, and four different species of candida (c. albicans, c. dubliniensis, c. glabrata and c. tropicalis) in periodontal pockets  and furcation sites of insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic patients with generalised chronic periodontitis. design: clinical parameters, including oral status assessed using plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, gingival recession and clinical attachment level and systemic conditions with fasting glucose level or glycosylated haemoglobin were measured in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis. samples of subgingival biofilm  were obtained from the periodontal pockets and furcation sites and submitted to phenol-chloroform dna extraction and pcr analysis using specific primers. results: clinical conditions of diabetic and non-diabetic patients were similar,  without statistical differences in both periodontal indexes and glucose levels (p>0.05). diabetics had a higher prevalence of candida spp., mainly c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, and a lower frequency of t. forsythia, when compared to non-diabetic patients, for both periodontal sites. c. glabrata and c. tropicalis  were not found in periodontal pockets and furcation sites of non-diabetic patients. conclusion: the results demonstrated a strong colonisation of candida spp. in the periodontal sites of diabetic patients that have generalised chronic  periodontitis with a higher prevalence of c. dubliniensis followed by c. albicans.

TI  == clarithromycin, as an adjunct to non surgical periodontal therapy for chronic periodontitis: a double blinded, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objective: along with conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy (nspt) systemic antimicrobials may provide more effective treatment for chronic periodontitis by targeting tissue-invasive bacteria. the aim of this randomized,  placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial was to evaluate the adjunctive effects of oral clarithromycin (clm) to non-surgical periodontal therapy for chronic periodontitis. methods: 40 patients were categorized into two groups: test group - scaling and root planing (srp) plus clm (500 mg b.i.d. for 3 days) and control group - srp plus placebo. clinical parameters were recorded at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months. they included gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal). also microbial analysis of dental plaque was done at baseline, 3 and 9 months to estimate the levels of periodontopathic organisms using polymerase chain reaction. anova, chi-square and bonferroni tests were used for statistical analysis. results: thirty-seven subjects completed the study and the results demonstrated that both groups displayed clinical improvements. using a subject-based analysis, patients treated with srp+clm showed enhanced reductions in pd and gains in cal (p<0.001) over time, as compared to control group. also significant reductions in periodontopathic organisms were noticed in the test group compared to control group. however, no statistically significant differences were noted for tannerella forsythia levels between the groups during the course of the study. conclusions: the utilisation of clm in combination with srp improves the efficacy of nspt in reducing pd, improving cal and in lessening microbial loads. hence, clm may be beneficial in the non-surgical treatment regimen of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == resveratrol inhibits periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == the gram-negative anaerobic bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and p. gingivalis (pg) are key components in the aetiology of periodontal disease, and associated hard-tissue destruction. resveratrol is a phytoalexin, produced naturally by several plants when under attack by bacterial or fungal pathogens. it is found in many foods including mulberries, peanuts and the skin of labrusca  and muscadine grapes. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on the in vitro growth of periodontal pathogens aa and pg. for comparison, resveratrol's effect on a variety of other oral microorganisms was also evaluated. resveratrol demonstrates a poor solubility in water, thus different concentrations of resveratrol in the solvent dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso) were added to calibrated suspensions of aa and pg. as a control, a parallel series of dilutions containing the vehicle dmso alone was made to measure the effect of the solvent. minimum inhibitory concentrations of the periodontal pathogens were calculated. all suspensions were incubated for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h in an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees c. at each time interval, selected dilutions from each culture broth were plated on blood agar plates. colonies appearing on blood agar plates were visually counted at 3 days for aa, and at 5 days for pg. the periodontal bacteria showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in viable counts after 1 h, whilst no colony forming units could be observed after 24 h. the results suggest that resveratrol possesses significant antimicrobial properties on periodontal pathogens in vitro.

TI  == influence of topography and hydrophilicity on initial oral biofilm formation on microstructured titanium surfaces in vitro.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (ti) substrates on initial oral biofilm formation. materials and methods: nine bacterial species belonging to the normal oral microbiota, including: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces israelii, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus sanguinis were tested on ti surfaces: pretreatment (pt [r(a) <0.2 mum]), acid-etched (a [r(a) <0.8 mum]), a modified to be hydrophilic (moda), sand-blasted/acid-etched (sla [r(a) =4 mum]), and hydrophilic sla (modsla). disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a normal culture medium (cm) or human saliva (hs). the total counts of bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces incubated with cm compared with the samples incubated with hs. pt, sla, and modsla exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in cm, whereas sla and modsla had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in hs. the proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also influenced by the surface properties and the media used: sla and modsla increased the proportion of species like a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of a. israelii and p. gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva. conclusions: the initial biofilm formation and composition were affected  by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the media used.

TI  == a novel approach to the use of subgingival controlled-release chlorhexidine delivery in chronic periodontitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: we aimed to analyze clinical, microbiologic, and serologic effects of chlorhexidine (chx) chips used as a subgingival controlled-release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing (srp). methods: twenty-four patients presenting with >/=12 teeth with probing depth (pd) >/=5 mm  and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups. after prophylaxis, chx chips (test) or placebo chips (control) were placed in pockets with pd >/=5 mm. ten days later, srp was performed in all teeth with pd >/=4 mm in a single appointment. immediately after srp, new chips were inserted in all pockets with pd >/=5 mm. parameters were assessed at baseline; beginning of srp;  and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. subgingival samples were obtained at baseline; beginning of srp; and at 1 month after treatment. periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were analyzed. serum levels of high sensitive c-reactive and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins were  measured. the changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by mann-whitney u test (p <0.05). results: all clinical and serologic parameters  improved in both groups over time. there was a significant difference in clinical attachment level (cal) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups (1.17 mm in  the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group) (p <0.05). the treatment with chx chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the "red complex" after 1 month (p = 0.02). conclusion: the use of chx chips before and immediately after srp improved cal and reduced the subgingival microorganisms of the red complex in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == microbial changes after full-mouth tooth extraction, followed by 2-stage implant  placement.
AB  == background: recent studies showed that qpcr could detect bacteria related to periodontitis and peri-implantitis in a low concentration after full-mouth tooth  extraction. this study monitored the microbiota from tooth extraction, over 9 months of full edentulism, up to 1 year after abutment connection. material and methods: ten patients with severe periodontitis were recruited. six months after  tooth extraction, implants were inserted. three to 6 months later, they were connected to abutments. plaque samples were collected from the tongue dorsum, saliva, and subgingival area (teeth/implants) before extraction up to 1 year after abutment connection, and analysed via culture, qpcr, and checkerboard technology. results: a reduction in the total amount of aerobic and anaerobic cfu/ml was observed. the concentration of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (qpcr and checkerboard) in the saliva and, to a lower extent, on the tongue dorsum reduced. for prevotella intermedia, changes were negligible and no  changes could be detected for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the pristine subgingival niches were quickly colonized by key pathogens. their final concentration remained low, while the detection frequencies remained very high over time. conclusion: complete edentulation results in a significant reduction of bacteria related to periodontitis and peri-implantitis, with the exception of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, which might indicate that key pathogens can survive without pockets.

TI  == detection of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: in recent years, increasing evidence regarding the potential association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases has been identified. the available evidence underlines the importance of detecting periodontal pathogens on atheromatous plaque as the first step in demonstrating the causal relationship between the two conditions. the main aim of this investigation is to detect periodontitis-associated bacteria from carotid artery  atheromatous plaque from patients who received an endarterectomy using strict sample procurement and laboratory procedures. methods: atheromatous plaque from endarterectomies from carotid arteries were scraped and homogenized, and bacterial dna was extracted. to obtain a representative concentration of amplicons, two amplifications of the bacterial 16s ribosomal-rna gene were carried out for each sample with universal eubacteria primers by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). a nested pcr with specific primers for the target bacteria  was performed next. statistical tests included the chi(2) test. results: forty-two atheromatous plaque were analyzed. all of them were positive for >/=1 target bacterial species. the bacterial species most commonly found was porphyromonas gingivalis (78.57%; 33 of 42), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (66.67%;  28 of 42), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (61.90%; 26 of 42),  eikenella corrodens (54.76%; 23 of 42), fusobacterium nucleatum (50.00%; 21 of 42), and campylobacter rectus (9.52%; four of 42). the simultaneous presence of various bacterial species within the same specimen was a common observation. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, the presence of dna from periodontitis-associated bacteria in carotid artery atheromatous plaque retrieved by endarterectomy is confirmed.

TI  == decreased phosphorylation of platelet vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein in periodontitis--a role of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == introduction: epidemiological studies indicate an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (vasp) in its phosphorylated form represents a regulator of platelet function and an indicator  for the sensitivity of platelets towards physiologically relevant antagonists of  platelet function. as platelets and their activation state play a central role in the development of cardiovascular disease, this study aimed to investigate the influence of periodontal disease and periodontal pathogens on intraplatelet vasp-phosphorylation and platelet function. material and methods: besides several markers of platelet activation, basal and pge(1) induced intracellular vasp-phosphorylation were determined in platelets of periodontitis patients (n =  26) and healthy donors (n = 19). furthermore, platelets from healthy donors were  incubated with distinct periodontal pathogens and basal and pge(1) induced vasp-phosphorylation was determined. results: compared to controls, platelets of  periodontitis patients showed a significant decrease in basal and pge(1) induced  vasp-phosphorylation. vasp-phosphorylation in platelets from periodontitis patients positive for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis or tannerella forsythia was significantly decreased compared to patients that were negative for these bacteria. furthermore, vasp-phosphorylation in platelets isolated from healthy donors was affected by incubation with these periodontal pathogens. conclusions: our results provide evidence that periodontitis interferes with vasp-phosphorylation in human platelets, presumably as a consequence of a direct effect of periodontitis-associated bacteria. decreased basal and pge(1) induced vasp-phosphorylation might represent a mechanism responsible for enhanced platelet activation in periodontitis.

TI  == azithromycin concentrations in blood and gingival crevicular fluid after systemic administration.
AB  == background: azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is active against several periodontal pathogens. macrolides are taken up and concentrated inside gingival fibroblasts, which could influence their pharmacokinetics. this study tests the hypothesis that steady-state levels of azithromycin are higher and more sustained in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) than in serum. methods: four healthy patients  received an initial dose of 500-mg azithromycin followed by 250-mg doses on each  of the next 2 days. serum and gcf samples were obtained 2 hours after the last dose on day 2, and on days 4 and 7. gcf samples were collected from maxillary posterior sites with paper strips. the strips were pooled and eluted with high-purity water. after extraction, the azithromycin content of the serum samples and gcf eluates was determined with an agar diffusion bioassay. results:  on days 2, 4, and 7, the concentrations of azithromycin in blood serum were 0.22  +/- 0.02, 0.08 +/- 0.02, and 0.04 +/- 0.01 mug/ml, respectively. the concentrations in gcf were 8.82 +/- 1.25, 7.90 +/- 1.72, and 7.38 +/- 1.15 mug/ml, respectively. mean gcf levels were significantly higher than mean serum levels (p </=0.02; paired t test). conclusions: the findings demonstrate that the pharmacokinetic profiles of azithromycin are different in gcf and serum. at steady state, azithromycin concentrations in gcf were higher and more sustained than those in serum. based on previous studies, the levels observed in gcf were above the minimal inhibitory concentration for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to assess the presence of subgingival pathogens in peripheral blood samples from periodontitis patients before and after scaling and root planing (sc/rp) using nested polymerase chain reaction (nested pcr). materials and methods: peripheral blood samples were obtained from 42 patients with severe generalized chronic or aggressive periodontitis. in each patient, four samples of peripheral blood were drawn at different times: immediately before the sc/rp procedure; immediately after sc/rp; 15 and 30 min. post-sc/rp. blood samples were analysed for bacteraemia with anaerobic culturing and nested pcr, using universal bacterial primers that target the 16s-rrna gene of most bacteria, subsequently re-amplified with specific primers to porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus and prevotella intermedia, using a modified phenol-chloroform method for dna extraction. results: presence of specific periodontal pathogens in peripheral blood after treatment was detected in 54.8% of the patients, in 47.6% with anaerobic culturing and in 19% with nested pcr. in 16.6%, the periodontal pathogens were detected before sc/rp. p. gingivalis and a. actynomicetemcomitans were the pathogens most frequently detected in the bloodstream before and after sc/rp. conclusions: nested pcr demonstrated the presence of dna from periodontal pathogens in blood samples in severe periodontitis patients before, during and after periodontal therapy. the use of these molecular-based techniques may improve the accuracy from the results obtained by haemoculture.

TI  == bacterial adhesion and colonization differences between zirconium oxide and titanium alloys: an in vivo human study.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to compare zirconium oxide and titanium alloys with respect to their tendency to adhesion and colonization of two periodontal pathogens on both hard surfaces and on soft tissues in vivo. materials and methods: the present study was designed as a prospective stratified randomized controlled clinical trial. patients were scheduled to receive two implants with different types of abutments in the posterior mandible. three months after implant placement, titanium and zirconium abutments were connected.  five weeks after abutment connections, the abutments were removed, probing depth  measurements were recorded, and gingival biopsy samples were obtained. abutments  and biopsy specimens were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to compare the dna copy numbers of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and total bacteria. the surface  free energy of the abutments was calculated by sesile water drop before replacement. results: no statistically significant differences were found between probing depths or dna copy numbers of a actinomycetemcomitans, p gingivalis, and  total bacteria both for both titanium alloys and zirconium oxide surfaces and the biops specimens obtained from their buccal gingival. with respect to the surface  free energy of zirconium and titanium abutments, zirconium abutments showed lower surface free energy than titanium abutments. conclusion: the results of this study showed that zirconium oxide surfaces have comparable properties to titanium alloy surfaces in their tendency to adhesion and colonization of two periodontal  pathogens on both hard surfaces and in soft tissues.

TI  == periodontal pathogen carriage, rather than periodontitis, determines the serum antibody levels.
AB  == aim: we investigated in a nationally representative sample, how periodontitis modifies the association between the carriage of periodontal pathogens and serology. materials and methods: the population comprised 1586 dentate subjects who participated in an interview, clinical and radiological oral health examination, and saliva collection. serum immunoglobulin a (iga)- and igg-class antibody levels against aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis and their salivary occurrence were determined in the whole population. the quantity of the pathogens was measured in a subpopulation. results: in the univariate analyses, the corresponding antibody levels were higher in the pathogen carriers compared with the non-carriers, and clearly higher in the carriers with periodontal pockets compared with the carriers without. in the multi-variate analyses, however, all antibody levels associated strongly with age (p<0.001) and the carriage of the corresponding pathogen (p<0.001), but only weakly with the presence or number of teeth with periodontal pockets. in the subpopulation, the antibody levels and the numbers of corresponding bacteria in saliva had a positive association, which was not affected by the disease. conclusions: the carriage of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis is the strongest determinant of the systemic antibody response to these pathogens, and the extent of periodontitis has at most a modest modifying effect.

TI  == [efficient, minimally invasive periodontal therapy. an evidence based treatment concept].
AB  == a large number of reports indicate beneficial effects of systemic antibiotics for patients with periodontal diseases. although these advantages are clear in general, the specific relationship of benefit and risk in various clinical situations remains a subject of debate. uncertainties persist regarding the individual prescription and combination with other procedures. since the early 1990s it has been pointed out that systemic antibiotics given in the context of non-surgical subgingival debridement may reduce the need for periodontal surgery. recent studies confirm these findings especially with regard to the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. however, these antibiotics should not be viewed as a substitute for thorough debridement, or as a means to compensate for improper oral hygiene. in addition, current evidence does not provide evidence for the indiscriminate use of just any antibiotic in any periodontal patient. a treatment protocol implementing the recent evidence is shown. it is noteworthy to realize that chronic and aggressive periodontitis today can be treated successfully with simple and cost-effective means in most instances.

TI  == antibody responses to periodontopathic bacteria in relation to rheumatoid arthritis in japanese adults.
AB  == background: periodontopathic bacteria have been implicated as contributory to the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). anticyclic citrullinated peptide (ccp) antibodies and rheumatoid factor (rf) were shown to be associated with ra. this study examines whether serum levels of antibodies to periodontopathic bacteria may affect clinical and laboratory profiles of ra. methods: the study participants consisted of 80 patients with ra, and 38 age-, sex-, smoking status-, and periodontal condition-balanced healthy controls. after periodontal and rheumatologic examination, serum levels of immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies  to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and eikenella corrodens (ec) and those of anti-ccp antibodies and rf were determined  by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: patients with ra showed significantly higher levels of anti-pg and anti-ccp antibodies than controls (p = 0.04 and p <0.0001). in contrast, igg responses to aa and ec in patients with ra  were significantly lower than those in controls (p <0.0001 and p = 0.0001). multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association of anti-pg and anti-aa igg responses with ra, after adjustment for age, sex, and smoking (p = 0.005 and p = 0.02). anti-pg titer displayed a significant correlation with rf levels, probing depth, and clinical attachment level (p = 0.03, p = 0.03, and p = 0.02). conclusion: these results suggest that serum levels of anti-pg igg antibodies were associated with ra, and might affect serum  levels of rf and periodontal condition in patients with ra.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: this study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (c1), acetic acid (c2), propionic acid (c3), butyric acid (c4), isobutyric acid (c4), isovaleric acid (c5), hexanoic acid (c6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (c8), capric acid (c10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (c14), palmitic acid (c16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared  related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. as a group the fatty acids were much less effective against c. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive  against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. conclusions: the results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (scfas), medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas), long-chain fatty acids (lcfas) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. first, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == [association between clinical parameters and the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in patients with progressive periodontal lesions].
AB  == background/aim: periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of periodontal tissues with consequential is bone loss as a result of host immunological reactions caused by periopathogens. the aim of the study was to investigate if there is a correlation between clinical parameters and the presence of two most aggressive periopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans--aa and porphyromonas gingivalis--pg) in patients with progressive periodontal lesions. methods: a total of 34 systemic healthy people, 23 to 70 years old, were included in the study. the patients were clinically and radiologically examined, and after that, the representative pocket with greatest pocket depth was chosen and the sample was collected from that place. the measured clinic parameters were: gingival index, index of gingival bleeding, pocket depth and plaque indices. the  multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was used for detection of periopathogens. after obtaining results, appropriate statistical tests were used  to correlate the clinical and microbiological results. results: aa and pg were detected in the same percentage of samples. aa and pg were detected in 35.29% samples alone, and in 29.41% both were detected. the values of measured clinical  parameters did not show a statistical significance between the groups. in analysis of correlations among clinical parameters inside the groups, a statistical significance was found only between gingival and plaque index in the  group with aa. conclusion: clinical course of periodontitis in the developed stage does not differ in relation to the presence of different periopathogens as  the major inductors of immunologically guided destructive processes.

TI  == molecular survey of atheromatous plaques for the presence of dna from periodontal bacterial pathogens, archaea and fungi.
AB  == background and objective: chronic infections, such as periodontitis, have been associated with the development and progression of atherosclerosis. the mechanisms through which this occurs have yet to be elucidated. this study was carried out to detect periodontopathic bacteria as well as archaea and fungi in atheromatous plaques and search for factors associated with their occurrence in atheromas. material and methods: a cross-sectional study was carried out including 30 patients diagnosed with atherosclerosis in the carotid, coronary or  femoral arteries. plaques were collected during surgery and analysed using pcr to detect aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and members of the synergistetes group. samples were also surveyed with universal primers for bacterial, archaeal and fungal dna. patients responded to a questionnaire to determine factors associated with pcr results. results: all dentate individuals (66.7%) had periodontal disease, 95% of which was severe and  65% extensive. none of the targeted periodontopathic bacteria was found in the atheromas. no sample yielded positive results for fungal and archaeal dna. four samples (13%) were positive for the presence of bacterial dna. of these, three participants were dentate (two with severely chronic generalized periodontitis and one with severely chronic localized periodontitis). conclusion: this study did not confirm previous findings of periodontal pathogens in atheromas, making it impossible to establish factors associated with their presence in plaques. presence of bacterial dna in some samples indicates that periodontal or nonoral bacterial species other than the ones targeted in this study may be involved with some cases of atherosclerosis.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == salivary infectious agents and periodontal disease status.
AB  == background and objectives: the potential of salivary microorganisms to diagnose periodontal disease and to guide periodontal treatment is a research topic of current interest. this study aimed to determine whether the salivary counts of periodontopathic microbes correlated with the periodontal pocket counts of the same infectious agents, and whether the salivary counts of the test infectious agents could distinguish among individuals with periodontal health and various types of periodontal disease. material and methods: the study included 150 systemically healthy adults, of whom 37 were periodontally healthy, 31 had gingivitis, 46 had chronic periodontitis and 36 had aggressive periodontitis. each study subject contributed microbial samples from the two deepest periodontal pockets of the dentition and from whole saliva. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and epstein-barr virus were identified using the taqman real-time pcr methodology. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test and the receiver operating characteristic statistics. results: c. rectus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia occurred with significantly higher copy-counts in salivary samples from patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis than from periodontally healthy individuals. a. actinomycetemcomitans only showed higher salivary copy-counts in  subjects with aggressive periodontitis compared with subjects with healthy periodontium, and the salivary copy-counts of epstein-barr virus did not reveal any significant difference among the four subject groups studied. the diagnostic  sensitivity for periodontitis was 89.19 for p. gingivalis and for t. forsythia and 86.49 for p. intermedia, with specificities ranging from 83.78 to 94.59. the  optimal copy-counts per ml saliva for identifying periodontitis were 40,000 for p. gingivalis, 700,000 for t. forsythia and 910,000 for p. intermedia. conclusion: salivary copy-counts of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and p. intermedia appear to have the potential to identify the presence of periodontitis, whereas the salivary level of the other test infectious agents may possess little or no diagnostic utility. longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the ability of salivary copy-counts of major periodontopathic bacteria to predict future periodontal breakdown.

TI  == effects of toluidine blue-mediated photodynamic therapy on periopathogens and periodontal biofilm: in vitro evaluation.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) is a selective modality of killing targeted cells, mostly known for its application in neoplasms. pdt can be considered to be an alternative method for the elimination of periodontal bacteria from the pocket without harms for the resident tissues. therefore, pdt may replace systemic antibiotics and enhance the effect of mechanical treatments of periodontal defects. this effort focused on the in vitro sensitization of periopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia ) toluidine blue mediated and on the use of a diode laser emitting source. the objective of this research was to evaluate the bactericidal in vitro effect of laser diodes 830 nm (as the light source) after photosensitization with toluidine blue (tbo) on the following periopathogenic bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia. after evaluating the effect on the single bacterial strain, the ability of diode laser to disrupt the structure  of biofilms produced by a. actinomycetemcomitans after photosensitization with tbo was also analyzed. the study suggests that the association of tbo and diode laser light 830 nm is effective for the killing of bacteria strains and determines the photoinactivation of aggregatibacter biofilms. in summary, photodynamic therapy has effectively shown its capabilities and, therefore, it can be considered a valid alternative approach to antimicrobial therapy of periodontitis.

TI  == comparison of gingival crevicular fluid sampling methods in patients with severe  chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the analysis of samplings from periodontal pockets is important in the diagnosis and therapy of periodontitis. in this study, three different sampling techniques were compared to determine whether one method yielded samples suitable for the reproducible and simultaneous determination of bacterial load, cytokines, neutrophil elastase, and arginine-specific gingipains (rgps). rgps are an important virulence factor of porphyromonas gingivalis, the exact concentration of which in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) has not been quantified. methods: gcf was sampled from four sites per patient (one sample per  quadrant using two samples per method) in 36 patients with chronic periodontitis. one week later, the procedure was repeated with alternative methods. variables determined were loads of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and p. gingivalis, levels of interleukin-6  and -8, activity of neutrophil elastase, and level of rgps. results: the detected cytokine levels were higher using paper strips compared to paper points. bacteria were found in similar loads from paper strips and paper points. rgps were only detectable in high quantities by washing the periodontal pocket. the level of rgps correlated with the load of p. gingivalis. conclusions: the use of paper strips was suitable for the simultaneous determination of microbial and immunologic parameters. obtaining gcf by washing can be useful for special purposes. the gingipain concentration in periodontal pockets was directly determined to be </=1.5 mum. this value indicated that most of the substrates of  these proteases by in vitro assays identified until now can be easily degraded in p. gingivalis-infected sites.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the  destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei.  corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio  bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

TI  == comparison of the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma in the assessment of the ability of common cultivable oral anaerobic bacteria to produce malodorous volatile sulfur compounds from cysteine and methionine.
AB  == objective: to compare the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma to assess the  ability of common oral anaerobic bacteria isolated from the kuwaiti population to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). materials and methods: broth cultures of common anaerobes isolated from supragingival plaque were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in phosphate buffer (ph 7.7) with an optical density od(550)  of 0.3. 100 mul of this suspension and 870 mul of buffer were added in 2 sterile  15-ml head space vials. reaction was initiated by addition of 30 mul of 33 mml-methionine and l-cysteine, respectively, in each vial and incubation at 37 degrees c for 90 min. 500 mul of 3 m phosphoric acid was added to tubes and was kept aside for 10 min. production of vscs was measured using the halimeter and the oral chroma. results: the major vsc producers identified by both halimeter and oral chroma with l-cystenine as substrate were campylobacter ureolyticus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and gemella morbillorum. the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide recorded by both halimeter and oral chroma were essentially identical. with l-methionine as substrate, both halimeter and oral chroma identified different complements of anaerobes with c. ureolyticus,p. gingivalis,fusobacterium nucleatum and p. intermedia as major vsc producers. the  concentrations of methyl mercaptan recorded by the halimeter were lower compared  to those assessed by the oral chroma. conclusion: the results suggest that the oral chroma may produce a more comprehensive assessment of vsc production by oral microflora than the halimeter.

TI  == antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of 4-hydroxycordoin: potential therapeutic benefits.
AB  == 4-hydroxycordoin (1), a natural isopentenyloxychalcone, is a plant secondary metabolite that is relatively rare. since there are very few reports about the biological activities of 1, its potential benefits for periodontal disease were investigated. a marked and dose-dependent antibacterial activity of 1 was observed against the three major periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. moreover, compound 1 showed an antiadhesion effect, since it inhibited attachment of p. gingivalis to oral epithelial cells. finally, using a macrophage model, the ability of 1 to inhibit  the secretion of inflammatory mediators induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide was demonstrated. the anti-inflammatory  effect observed was associated with reduced activation of the nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) pathways.

TI  == comparison of real-time polymerase chain reaction and dna-strip technology in microbiological evaluation of periodontitis treatment.
AB  == the impact of a semiquantitative commercially available test based on dna-strip technology (microident(r), hain lifescience, nehren, germany) on diagnosis and treatment of severe chronic periodontitis of 25 periodontitis patients was evaluated in comparison with a quantitative in-house real-time pcr. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline as well as at 3, 6, and 12 months later. after extracting dna, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and several other periodontopathogens were determined by both methods. the results obtained by dna-strip technology were analyzed semiquantitatively and additionally quantitatively by densitometry. the results for the 4 major periodontopathogenic  bacterial species correlated significantly between the 2 methods. samples detecting a high bacterial load by one method and negative by the other were always found in less than 2% of the total samples. both technologies showed the impact of treatment on microflora. especially the semiquantitative dna-strip technology clearly analyzed the different loads of periodontopathogens after therapy and is useful in microbial diagnostics for patients in dental practices.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis promotes murine abdominal aortic aneurysms via matrix metalloproteinase-2 induction.
AB  == background and objective: abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) is a common and lethal  disorder, and mmps are highly expressed in aaa lesions. large numbers of periodontopathic bacteria have been reported to be present in specimens obtained  from the aortic walls of patients with an aaa. the purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of periodontopathic bacteria on aaa dilatation. material and methods: aaas were produced in mice by the periaortic application of 0.25 m cacl(2), and nacl was used as a control. the mice were inoculated once weekly with live porphyromonas gingivalis, live aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or vehicle. results: four weeks after the periaortic application of either cacl(2) or nacl, a significant increase was observed in the aortic diameter of p. gingivalis-challenged mice compared with the vehicle control mice (p < 0.05), whereas there was no statistically significant increase in the aortic diameter of the a. actinomycetemcomitans-challenged mice. immunohistochemical analysis found  significantly higher numbers of cd8-positive and moma2-positive cells and significantly higher levels of mmp-2 in the aneurysmal samples of p. gingivalis-challenged mice compared with control mice. live p. gingivalis promoted a significant proliferation of splenocytes in comparison with p. gingivalis-lipopolysaccharide and live a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.05). conclusion: these findings demonstrate that challenge with p. gingivalis, but not with a. actinomycetemcomitans, can accelerate, or even initiate, the progression  of experimental aaa through the increased expression of mmps.

TI  == serum cytokine levels in periodontitis patients in relation to the bacterial load.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a local inflammatory disease that also has some systemic effects. we investigated the levels of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-2, -4, -5, and -10 in the serum of patients with periodontitis in relation to the bacterial load in the dental plaques. methods: serum cytokine levels in patients with generalized periodontitis and healthy control groups were determined using the cytometric bead array kit. bacterial load in the dental plaque was determined semiquantitatively by real-time polymerase chain reaction. the proportions of different lymphocyte subsets were determined in the peripheral blood of patients  with periodontitis by flow cytometry. finally, relationships between the bacterial load in the subgingival plaques of patients with periodontitis and levels of cytokines and counts of lymphocyte subsets were established. results: serum levels of ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha, and il-10 were significantly increased, whereas those of il-2 were significantly decreased in patients with periodontitis compared to healthy controls. increased serum levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha in patients with periodontitis were associated with the enhanced dental plaque load with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. finally, as revealed by analysis of lymphocyte populations, the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and trepomena denticola was associated with an increased population of cd3(-)/cd16(+) and cd3(+)/cd8(+) cells, respectively. conclusion: certain periodontal pathogens could be associated with an increased level of proinflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood and thus increased risk of systemic diseases.

TI  == maintenance after a complex orthoperio treatment in a case of generalized aggressive periodontitis: 7-year result.
AB  == background: generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) encompasses a distinct type of periodontal disease exhibiting much more rapid periodontal tissue destruction than chronic periodontitis. the best method for management of gagp may include the use of both regenerative periodontal techniques and the administration of systemic antibiotics. methods: the treatment of a case of gagp  over a period of 6.7 years is presented in this case report. initial periodontal  therapy (week 1- 32) consisted of supragingival plaque control and three appointments of scaling and root planing. based on the periodontal pathogens isolated (5 species), the patient also received metronidazole plus amoxicillin for one week, followed 10 weeks later by metronidazole plus amoxicillin/clavulanate for one week. the patient was put on regular supportive periodontal therapy (spt) thereafter. orthodontic treatment was performed after completion of the initial therapy for 96 weeks. measurements of clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing and plaque index were obtained at every examination. results: antimicrobial and mechanical treatment resulted in eradication of all periopathogens and significantly improved all clinical parameters. during orthodontic treatment and active maintenance, there was no relapse of gagp. the patient participated in spt for 194 weeks and thereafter decided to discontinue spt. twenty-four months later a relapse of gagp was diagnosed and all teeth had to be extracted. conclusions: these results indicate  that a combined mechanical and antimicrobial treatment approach can lead to consistent resolution of gagp. further studies including a larger number of cases are warranted to validate these findings.

TI  == association of three bacterial species and periodontal status in chinese adults:  an epidemiological approach.
AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are oral pathogens associated with periodontitis. the association between these three bacteria and periodontal disease has been reported in populations of many countries. however, corresponding data in chinese populations are still lacking. the aim of this study was to detect these pathogens in subgingival plaque collected from 468 subjects with chronic periodontitis in a group of chinese adults by using a pcr method and to determine the degree of association between the target bacteria and periodontal status based on logistic  regression analysis. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia were found in 20.5%, 70.7%, and 77.1% of the subjects, respectively. about one-third (36.1%) of subjects had chronic periodontitis. upon univariate analysis, age, male gender, current smoking status, diabetes, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis were positively associated with chronic periodontitis, whereas education and income exhibited inverse associations with chronic periodontitis. upon multivariate analysis, education, current smoking status, diabetes, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis  remained significant. the adjusted odds ratios for having chronic periodontitis were 2.5 and 3.4 in subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, respectively. however, no significant association was observed between the presence of t. forsythia and periodontal status. this study assesses  the prevalence of periodontal pathogens and chronic periodontitis and the associations with sociodemographic characteristics among this group of chinese adults. these findings also suggest that pcr should be considered for field oral  epidemiologic studies and may be necessary in investigations presenting major logistic challenges.

TI  == periodontopathogens induce soluble p-selectin release by endothelial cells and platelets.
AB  == introduction: soluble p-selectin plays a pivotal role in inflammation and the development of thrombotic and cardiovascular disease. accordingly, elevated levels of soluble p-selectin are found in periodontitis and (other forms of) inflammatory diseases. however, the cellular source of soluble p-selectin in periodontitis and the effects of periodontopathogens on p-selectin release are unknown. material and methods: soluble p-selectin was determined in 26 patients with periodontitis and 19 controls. furthermore, human endothelial cells and platelets were investigated for their ability to elicit soluble and surface p-selectin in response to periodontopathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and p.  gingivalis. moreover surface e-selectin and icam-1 expression as well as nfkappab translocation in response to these bacteria were determined on endothelial cells  as well as the formation of platelet-leukocyte complexes. results: plasma levels  of soluble p-selectin are significantly elevated in periodontitis and correlate with severity of disease and bacterial infection. stimulation of endothelial cells with periodontopathogens results in rapid surface expression of p-selectin  but does not induce nfkappab translocation and subsequent de novo synthesis of p-selectin, e-selectin or icam-1. in platelets, bacterial stimulation leads to surface expression of p-selectin and fosters the formation of platelet-leukocyte  aggregates within minutes. p-selectin is rapidly shed from the surface of platelets and endothelial cells and results in increased levels of soluble p-selectin. conclusions: periodontopathogens are able to directly cause activation of endothelial cells and platelets within minutes. given that transient periodontitis-associated bacteremia commonly occurs after tooth brushing or chewing, our data suggest that reduction of periodontopathogens might result in potential cardiovascular benefits.

TI  == one-stage full-mouth disinfection as a therapeutic approach for generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: data concerning treatment outcomes in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) are limited. the aim of this study is to investigate 6-month clinical and microbiologic outcomes of the one-stage full-mouth disinfection (osfmd) in the management of patients with gagp. methods: twenty-seven patients with advanced gagp were included in this prospective follow-up intervention study. clinical and microbiologic parameters were collected at baseline and 3 and 6 months after the osfmd. patient-, tooth-, and site-level analyses were carried out. subgingival samples from moderate (4 to 5 mm) and deep (>/=6 mm) pocket sites were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola. results: the osfmd resulted in significant improvements in all parameters. after  6 months, the whole-mouth probing depth (pd) decreased from 4.2 +/- 1.1 mm to 2.8 +/- 0.6 mm, and the clinical attachment level was reduced from 4.5 +/- 1.2 mm to  3.4 +/- 1.1 mm (p <0.001). when data were analyzed based on the frequency distribution of pd, the number of sites with pd >/=5 mm decreased by 61% from baseline values, and mean pd reductions of 1.5 and 2.5 mm were noted in moderate  and deep pockets, respectively. at 6 months, percentages of moderate and deep sites free of pathogens were 40% and 27%, respectively. conclusion: the osfmd may be a viable approach to deal with severe gagp.

TI  == the effect of a single episode of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the treatment of experimental periodontitis. microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in the dog mandible.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were  determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene  were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00)  and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were  similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species  and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

TI  == c-reactive protein as a systemic marker of inflammation in periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis has been identified as a potential risk factor for systemic pathologies such as cardiovascular disease (cvd). the aims of this investigation  were to assess the relationship between periodontitis and systemic inflammatory factor, as well as to discover whether there is a relation to the severity of periodontitis and to the periodontopathogens. periodontal examinations and serum  c-reactive protein (crp) level measurements were performed in 50 patients with periodontitis. periodontal health indicators included the gingival bleeding on probing index and periodontal disease status. the patients with moderate periodontitis had low attachment loss and pocket depth <4 mm. the patients with severe periodontitis had high attachment loss and pocket depth >5 mm. the control group comprised 25 volunteers with healthy gingiva, gingival sulcus <2 mm and no  attachment loss. the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples was analysed by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. the periodontal parameters and crp levels were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis. patients who had severe periodontitis, with high levels of mean clinical attachment loss, and subjects with moderate periodontitis had higher mean crp levels. the percentage of subjects with elevated levels of crp >5 mg/l was greater in the higher clinical attachment loss group compared to the group with lower attachment loss.  the presence of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were also associated with elevated crp levels and poor periodontal status. periodontitis and the presence of p. gingivalis are associated with an enhanced inflammatory response expressed by higher crp levels. the association of periodontitis with crp levels  appears to be a contributing factor for cvd and might be a possible intermediate  pathway in this association.

AB  == aim: to compare the early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health of mucosa adjacent to zirconia (zro(2)) and titanium (ti) abutment surfaces in vivo. materials and methods: twenty edentulous subjects received two endosseous mandibular implants. the implants were fitted with either a zro(2) or a ti abutment (non-submerged implant placement, within-subject comparison, left-right  randomization). sulcular bacterial sampling and the assessment of probing pocket  depth, recession and bleeding on probing were performed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. wilcoxon matched-pairs, sign-rank tests were applied to test differences in the counts of seven marker bacteria and the clinical parameters that were associated with the zro(2) and ti abutments, at the two observation time points. results: zro(2) and ti abutments harboured similar counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola at 2 weeks and 3 months. healthy clinical conditions were seen around both zro(2) and ti abutments at all times, without significant differences in most clinical parameters of peri-implant soft tissue health. mean probing depths around ti abutments were slightly deeper than around  zro(2) abutments after 3 months (2.2 sd 0.8 mm vs. 1.7 sd 0.7 mm, p=0.03). conclusions: no difference in health of the soft tissues adjacent to zro(2) and ti abutment surfaces or in early bacterial colonization could be demonstrated, although somewhat shallower probing depths were observed around zro(2) abutments  after 3 month.

TI  == development and in vitro evaluation of biopolymers as a delivery system against periodontopathogen microorganisms.
AB  == periodontal disease is the major cause of tooth loss in adults. porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are considered key pathogens in periodontitis. the treatment consists of oral hygiene education, instrumentation for removal of calculus (scaling), chemotherapy and periodontal surgery. several agents are commercially available; these chemicals can alter oral microbiota and have undesirable side-effects such as vomiting, diarrhea and  tooth staining. hence, the search for alternative products continues and natural  phytochemicals isolated from plants used as traditional medicine and the use of biomaterials are considered good alternatives. chitosan and pullulan are polymers that have been proposed due to their favorable properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and adhesion ability. they can be used as local delivery systems of active principles of plant extracts. thymus vulgaris, matricaria chamomilla, croton lechleri, calendula officinalis l. and juliana adstringens schl. are known to have medicinal activity, and they are used in mexican traditional medicine. their extracts were tested in vitro for antimicrobial activity against p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans, using  agar diffusion and microdilution methods. the antimicrobial activity of films from biopolymers with plant extracts was evaluated by measuring the zones of inhibition against the tested organisms. the aim of this study was to develop bioadhesive films from chitosan and pullulan with added plant extracts and determine the antimicrobial activity of films against periodontal pathogens.

TI  == activity of antimicrobial peptide mimetics in the oral cavity: ii. activity against periopathogenic biofilms and anti-inflammatory activity.
AB  == whereas periodontal disease is ultimately of bacterial etiology, from multispecies biofilms of gram-negative anaerobic microorganisms, much of the deleterious effects are caused by the resultant epithelial inflammatory response. hence, development of a treatment that combines anti-biofilm antibiotic activity  with anti-inflammatory activity would be of great utility. antimicrobial peptides (amps) such as defensins are naturally occurring peptides that exhibit broad-spectrum activity as well as a variety of immunomodulatory activities. furthermore, bacteria do not readily develop resistance to these agents. however, clinical studies have suggested that they do not represent optimal candidates for exogenous therapeutic agents. small-molecule mimetics of these amps exhibit similar activities to the parent peptides, in addition to having low toxicity, high stability and low cost. to determine whether amp mimetics have the potential for treatment of periodontal disease, we examined the activity of one mimetic, mpe, against biofilm cultures of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. metabolic assays as well as culture and biomass measurement assays demonstrated that mpe exhibits potent activity against biofilm cultures of both species. furthermore, as little as 2 mug ml(-1) mpe was sufficient to inhibit interleukin-1beta-induced secretion of interleukin-8 in both gingival epithelial cells and thp-1 cells. this anti-inflammatory activity is associated with a reduction in activation of nuclear factor-kappab, suggesting that mpe can act both as an anti-biofilm agent in an anaerobic environment and as an anti-inflammatory agent in infected tissues.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

AB  == background: the development of periodontal disease has been thought to be associated with several restricted members of the oral anaerobic species, such as black-pigmented porphyromonas species and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), in the subgingival environment. apart from bacteria, certain viruses and fungi that are associated with periodontal disease are also present in the subgingival plaque . materials and methods: a randomized, double-blind, crossover split-mouth design was performed. a total of 16 patients suffering from generalized chronic periodontitis were selected for the study. the study period of 18 days was divided into two time-intervals, i.e. baseline (0 days) to 7 th day, with a washout period of 4 days followed by a second time interval of 7 days. the use of ozone and chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) irrigation was randomized. both the patient and the clinician evaluating the clinical parameters were blinded regarding the type of irrigation used. results: the interpretation of clinical and microbial data is from baseline to 7 th day. a higher percentage  of plaque index (12%), gingival index (29%) and bleeding index (26%) reduction was observed using ozone irrigation as compared to chlorhexidine. the percentile  reduction of aa (25%) using ozone was appreciable as compared to no change in aa  occurrence using chlorhexidine. by using o 3 and chlorhexidine, there was no antibacterial effect on porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythensis. the antifungal effect of ozone from baseline (37%) to 7 th day (12.5%) was pronounced during the study period, unlike chx, which did not demonstrate any antifungal effect. conclusion: ozone may be considered as an alternative management strategy due to its powerful ability to inactivate microorganisms. also, there is growing evidence that ozone can be employed as a useful therapeutic agent in both dentistry and medicine.

TI  == investigation of subgingival profile of periodontopathic bacteria using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus and treponema denticola play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontitis. the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between periodontal clinical parameters and the subgingival profile of periodontopathic bacteria. twenty-six periodontitis patients (23-62 years of age; mean age, 40.2+/-13.2) with no systemic disease agreed to participate in the study. periodontal clinical parameters, including probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from deep (pd>/=4 mm) and shallow (pd</=3 mm) pockets in each patient for detection of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. forsythia, c. rectus and t. denticola by polymerase chain reaction technique. the relationship between the periodontal  pathogens and clinical parameters was determined with the fisher exact test, and  a statistically significant association was found between detection of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, c. rectus and t. denticola and pd or bop. t. denticola  was the most prevalent pathogen in both shallow pd and deep pd sites. no statistically significant association was found between detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and the clinical parameters examined. a statistically significant association was found between detection of the red complex bacteria and the clinical parameters. these results suggest that the red complex pathogens and c. rectus play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontitis.

TI  == efficacy and safety of adjunctive local moxifloxacin delivery in the treatment of periodontitis.
AB  == background: moxifloxacin exerts excellent antibacterial activity against most putative periodontal pathogens and has been shown to kill bacteria in biofilm and host cells. methods: patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to receive a single subgingival application of a 0.125%, 0.4%, or 1.25% moxifloxacin gel or placebo gel immediately after full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp). clinical efficacy measurements were assessed in sites with baseline probing depth (pd) of >/=5.4 mm at 6 weeks and 3 months and any adverse  events were determined. in addition, putative periodontal pathogens and resistance of subgingival bacteria against moxifloxacin were assessed. results: data of 57 patients were included in the statistical analysis. in all treatment groups, the pd decreased from baseline to 3 months, with the greatest reduction seen in patients treated with moxifloxacin 0.4% (1.5 +/- 0.6 mm; p = 0.023 compared to placebo), followed by patients receiving moxifloxacin 1.25% (1.2 +/-  0.4), moxifloxacin 0.125% (1.1 +/- 1.1), and placebo (1.0 +/- 0.6). no linear trend for pd reduction with increasing moxifloxacin concentrations was found. porphyromonas gingivalis showed the greatest reduction in prevalence among the assessed pathogens, without any significant intergroup differences. no correlation or systematic relationship between adverse events, including bacterial resistance against moxifloxacin, and the investigational gels was found. conclusions: in periodontal pockets with pd of >/=5.4 mm, a single subgingival administration of a 0.4% moxifloxacin gel as an adjunct to srp may result in additional pd reduction compared to srp alone. in addition, the investigated moxifloxacin gels seem to be safe.

TI  == analysis of immune responses to purified recombinant antigens of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the accumulating knowledge about host-pathogen interactions in infectious diseases shows how the immune system interfaces with pathogens, and thus, helps us in understanding the pathogenesis of diseases and improving their treatment. purified antigens are indispensable while investigating the immune response in both innate and acquired immunities. it is ideal to use native antigens purified  from the host organisms in native conditions that sustain their biological activity completely. however, purification of native antigens, especially on a large scale, is technically difficult and generally time consuming. purifying protein as a peptide-tagged fusion protein is an effective approach. purification of a recombinant protein engineered to incorporate a polyhistidine tag at either  the carboxyl or amino terminus is an established method, and it can be easily modified to obtain optimal results under different conditions. heat-shock proteins were highly conserved during evolution and are highly homologous between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. their molecular mimicry might have roles in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. we successfully generated histidine-tagged recombinant heat-shock proteins from the periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the recombinant proteins allowed us to evaluate the immune response to these antigens in periodontitis patients.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal bacteria in saliva of kuwaiti children at different age groups.
AB  == aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis and porphyromonas gingivalis and to a lesser extent prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, are gram-negative species that are associated with destructive periodontitis. studies from different parts of the world have shown variable detection rates of periodontal organisms. hardly any data exist on their carriage in children living in the middle east. this study was designed to determine the detection of these species in the oral cavity of 240 generally healthy kuwaiti children, divided into five age groups: <6 years (n=40), 6-9 years (n=60), 10-12 years (n=40), 13-15 years (n=40) and 16-18 years  (n=60). saliva was used as the microbiological specimen, and the samples were analyzed by molecular methods using multiplex pcr. a total of 185 (77.1%) of the  240 children were colonized by at least one of the target periodontal bacteria. in all age groups, p. nigrescens was the most prominent and detected in saliva of 15%, 32%, 63%, 50%, and 47% of the children at the five age groups, respectively. p. gingivalis was detected only occasionally. only few pathogens were found before the permanent dentition, i.e. at the age of <6 years. the highest carriage rates were from the groups between 6 and 15 years of age. the salivary carriage of the pathogens was essentially similar in the age groups of 10-12 years and 13-15 years. in conclusion, except for p. gingivalis, the examined periodontal pathogens are relatively common findings in kuwaiti children and colonize the oral cavity from childhood onwards.

TI  == association between interleukin-6 -174 polymorphism and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: we previously demonstrated an association between interleukin-6 (il-6) polymorphisms and the detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in aggressive and chronic periodontitis on a patient basis (pooled samples). the aim of this study is to comprehensively analyze the relative contribution of il-6 genetic factors and local (tooth and site) factors on the detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: forty patients diagnosed with severe chronic periodontitis had subgingival samples harvested from four sites (the deepest probing depths in each quadrant). all subjects had a blood sample taken to genotype the single nucleotide polymorphism at position -174 in the il-6 gene promoter. nested polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed on subgingival  plaque samples for the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis in each of the 160 sampled sites. the association between il-6 -174 genotypes and bacterial detection was investigated with multilevel analysis accounting for the  clustering of multiple sites analyzed within patients. results: respectively 60%, 62%, and 40% of subjects had a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and both bacteria concomitantly detected in >/=1 site. the multilevel analysis confirmed that, among all site and subject factors, il-6 -174 g homozygosity showed the strongest association with the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in all subjects and in the subgroup of whites only. no associations were detected for p. gingivalis. conclusion: this study provides further confirmatory evidence that the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans is associated with il-6 genetic factors in chronic periodontitis cases.

TI  == energy dose parameters affect antimicrobial photodynamic therapy-mediated eradication of periopathogenic biofilm and planktonic cultures.
AB  == objective: this study evaluated the in vitro efficacy of a commercially available apdt system in eradication of the periopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. background data: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) is an effective antibacterial approach in vitro; however, few data are available regarding effective light-energy parameters. materials and methods: planktonic and biofilm cultures of periopathogens were exposed to a methylene blue-based formulation and irradiated with a 670-nm nonthermal diode laser. energy doses were varied from 2.3 to 9.4 j/cm(2) through adjustments in illumination time and a constant power density. controls consisted of no treatment, light only, and photosensitizer only. temperature changes were recorded in experimental samples before and after illumination. results: apdt with an energy dose of 9.4 j/cm(2) was effective in eradicating p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans in biofilm and planktonic form. reductions from control in planktonic cultures at this energy dose were 6.8 +/- 0.7, 5.2 +/- 0.6, and 1.9 +/- 0.6 log(10), respectively, whereas biofilm reductions were 4.5 +/- 1.2, 3.4 +/- 1.1, and 4.9 +/- 1.4 log(10). decreasing the treatment time produced an energy dose-dependent killing effect in both models. changes in sample temperature did not exceed 3 degrees c under these exposure parameters. conclusion: this study demonstrated that three important periopathogens are susceptible to apdt-mediated killing, regardless of whether they are present in planktonic or biofilm form. furthermore, a clear energy dose-dependence exists with this treatment that should to be taken into account when determining optimal treatment times in clinical application.

TI  == microbiota around teeth and dental implants in periodontally healthy, partially edentulous patients: is pre-implant microbiological testing relevant?
AB  == this study aimed to assess the prevalence of seven periodontal marker pathogens,  before implant placement and 1 yr after loading, in periodontally healthy individuals and to assess the long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of pathogens to below threshold levels. in 93 individuals needing single tooth replacement, pooled subgingival microbiological samples from standard sites were  cultured and analyzed before implant treatment and 1 yr after loading. threshold  levels commonly used in periodontology to predict periodontal breakdown were applied. subjects with levels of pathogens above these thresholds received initial periodontal treatment including systemic antibiotics when indicated. at baseline, 49.5% of periodontally healthy subjects harboured one or more marker pathogens above threshold levels. periodontal treatment reduced the pathogen levels below threshold values in 78.3% of these initially colonized subjects. in  all cases aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were reduced to below threshold. at 1 yr after loading, periodontal pathogens were present above threshold levels in 74.1% of all subjects. it is concluded that in  almost half of periodontal healthy individuals the subgingival biofilm harbours periodontal pathogens above threshold values. long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of the selected marker pathogens appeared limited in our patient population, making pre-implant reduction unpredictive for post-implant levels of these pathogens. thus, considering the applied microbiological criteria, generalized pre-implant microbiological testing is not contributory in  periodontally healthy subjects.

AB  == purpose: to characterize the normal bacterial flora and evaluate the presence of  periodontopathogenic bacteria around dental implants and to correlate them with the periodontal flora or, in completely edentulous patients, the alveolar gingival flora. materials and methods: clinical and radiographic parameters were  recorded to exclude peri-implantitis in 34 partially edentulous and 19 completely edentulous patients. partially edentulous patients were subdivided into two subgroups based on the depth of the periodontal pocket: </= 4 mm (n = 19) and > 4 mm (n = 15). microbial samples were collected from peri-implant sulci, the deepest periodontal sulci, and, for completely edentulous patients, from the alveolar gingiva. predominant aerobic bacteria were determined by microbiologic culturing, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect five periodontopathogenic bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: in all the examined patients, oral streptococci were the most frequent aerobic peri-implant bacteria. the frequency of four periodontopathogenic bacteria in tooth sulci (a actino?mycetemcomitans, p gingivalis, t forsythensis, t denticola) was significantly higher around natural  teeth with deeper periodontal pockets, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of the same bacteria in peri-implant sulci in the two partially edentulous subgroups. in contrast, there were no such bacteria in the peri-implant sulci or the alveolar gingiva of completely edentulous patients. conclusions: in healthy peri-implant sulci, oral streptococci constitute the predominant bacterial flora. in partially edentulous patients four periodontopathogenic bacteria were detected around implants, and none of these bacteria were found around implants in completely edentulous patients.

TI  == examination of periodontal pathogens in stenotic valve specimens and in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. the influence of periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular diseases needs  further investigation. therefore, the aims of this clinical study are: to test the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in aortic valves and to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in whole blood samples  in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis. nineteen consecutive patients (12 males and 7 females, age: 49-85 years) were enrolled in  this study after having been subjected to a complete periodontal evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. all patients were scheduled for aortic valve replacement surgery. after clinical and microbial periodontal examination, the aortic valve tissue specimens were obtained by excision during valve replacement surgery and the patients were subjected to the whole blood sampling before the surgery. the polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the putative periodontal pathogens tannerella forshytia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and treponema  denticola. neither the 19 aortic valve specimens nor the blood samples were positive for the genoma of the selected periodontal pathogens. the selected periodontal pathogens did not colonize the aortic valve of patients affected by stenosis and bacterial genoma was not present in whole blood samples. a high blood pressure at the aortic valve may prevent the adhesion and proliferation of  bacterial colonies.

TI  == anti-phosphorylcholine-opsonized low-density lipoprotein promotes rapid production of proinflammatory cytokines by dendritic cells and natural killer cells.
AB  == background and objective: epidemiological and animal studies suggest that periodontal infections increase atherosclerosis risk. periodontitis patients have elevated levels of anti-phosphorylcholine (anti-pc) reactive not only with numerous periodontal organisms but also with minimally modified low-density lipoprotein (mmldl). dendritic cells (dcs) reside in arterial walls and accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions. the ability of anti-pc to bind mmldl prompted the hypothesis that opsonized mmldl would stimulate dcs and enhance the  production of proinflammatory cytokines that promote atherogenic plaque development. material and methods: monocyte-derived dcs (mdcs) were generated using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) and interleukin (il)-4, then stimulated with mmldl or with anti-pc-opsonized mmldl. the anti-pc effect was determined using flow cytometry, cofocal microscopy and cytokine assays. the production of cd83, il-12p35 mrna, il-12p40 mrna, il-12p70 and il-10  by dcs was monitored. results: dendritic cells stimulated with mmldl expressed little cd83 and produced little il-12p70. however, anti-pc-opsonized mmldl enhanced dc maturation, as indicated by upregulated cd83 and rapid (</= 48 h) production of il-12p70 if a source of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) was available. in leukocyte cultures, natural killer (nk) cells rapidly produced ifn-gamma (</=  48 h) when interacting with il-12-producing dcs activated by anti-pc-opsonized mmldl. moreover, ifn-gamma promoted dc il-12 responses that were further augmented when mmldl was opsonized with anti-pc. conclusion: minimally modified ldl-stimulated dcs and nk cells were mutually stimulatory, with dc il-12p70 needed by nk cells and with nk cell ifn-gamma needed by dcs. moreover, production of these proinflammatory cytokines was markedly enhanced when ldl was opsonized by anti-pc. in short, the data suggest that the elevated anti-pc levels in periodontitis patients could promote a mechanism that facilitates atherosclerosis.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of subgingival species in chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == background and objective: the increasing rate of resistance of microorganisms to  penicillin and other antibiotics has generated concern among health authorities in latin america. the present investigation determined the in vitro susceptibility of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, black-pigmented prevotella spp. and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin and moxifloxacin in patients with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from patients with periodontitis were collected and cultured on selective and nonselective culture media. the antimicrobial susceptibility of periodontopathogenic isolates was studied in chronic periodontitis patients in colombia. metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were tested on all bacterial isolates and the percentage of resistant strains was calculated. results: of the 150 bacteria identified, 51 were p. gingivalis, 45 were black-pigmented prevotella spp., 36 were f. nucleatum and 18 were a. actinomycetemcomitans. all the isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid and to moxifloxacin, but exhibited variable susceptibility patterns to the other antimicrobial agents tested. conclusion: the results of the present study suggest that periodontal microorganisms in patients with chronic periodontitis can be resistant to the antimicrobial agents commonly used in anti-infective periodontal therapy. we suggest that the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials could result in the appearance of more highly antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria associated with periodontal diseases in our population compared with the populations of other countries.

TI  == levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, inflammatory cytokines and species-specific immunoglobulin g in generalized aggressive and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: aggressive periodontitis pathogenesis still is not completely understood in the literature regarding the relationship between microbial and inflammatory aspects. so this study aimed to compare microbial and  inflammatory patterns in the gingival crevicular fluid of generalized aggressive  and chronic periodontitis patients. material and methods: forty aggressive and 28 chronic periodontitis patients were selected. biofilm and gingival crevicular fluid were collected from a deep pocket (periodontal probing depth >7 mm) and a moderate pocket (periodontal probing depth = 5 mm) of each patient, and microbiological and immunoenzymatic assays were performed. real-time pcr was used to determine quantities of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) was employed  to determine gingival crevicular fluid levels of interleukin-1beta, interferon-gamma, prostaglandin e(2) and interleukin-10. in addition, immunoglobulin g (igg) levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis  lipopolysaccharide were also determined by elisa. analysis of variance/tukey test, mann-whitney u-test and the pearson correlation test were used to determine differences and correlations between variables analysed (alpha = 5%). results: patients suffering from generalized aggressive periodontitis had their mouth colonized by higher amounts of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis than chronic periodontitis patients. conversely, the gingival crevicular fluid levels  of igg against both pathogens were statistically inferior in aggressive periodontitis patients (p < 0.05). with regard to gingival crevicular fluid levels of cytokines, aggressive periodontitis patients presented reduced levels of interleukin-10 (p < 0.05). conclusion: in comparison to chronic periodontitis, generalized aggressive periodontitis patients have an imbalance in the host response, with reduced levels of interleukin-10 and igg, and increased periodontal pathogens.

AB  == periodontal disease involves complex interactions of microorganisms and host defenses. this work investigated the associations between putative bacterial pathogens, herpesviruses and chronic periodontitis. subgingival samples were collected from 40 periodontally healthy individuals and from 40 patients with chronic periodontitis with probing depths of < or =3 mm or > or =6 mm. multiplex  and nested polymerase chain reactions were used to identify bacterial pathogens and herpesviruses. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, epstein-barr virus (ebv) type 1, cytomegalovirus (cmv), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  and ebv type 2 were detected in, respectively, 95, 75, 72.5, 50, 12.5 and 10% of  sites with probing depths > or =6 mm. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, ebv-1 and cmv  were statistically associated with probing depths > or =6 mm. a. actinomycetemcomitans and ebv-2 showed no association with periodontitis sites, and no significant associations were found for any of the test infectious agents  and probing depths < or =3 mm. our results confirm an association between p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, ebv-1 and cmv, and chronic periodontitis. these infectious agents may play an important synergistic role in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == occurrence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotypes in subgingival plaque from united states subjects.
AB  == this study examined the distribution pattern of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotypes in the subgingival plaque of subjects residing in the united states. a. actinomycetemcomitans was identified in 256 subgingival plaque samples from 161 subjects. for 190 of the 256 samples, the total cultivable bacteria and selected periodontal pathogenic species were determined.  a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates were confirmed by a16s rdna-based pcr analysis, genotyped by arbitrarily-primed pcr, and serotyped by pcr analysis of serotype-specific gene clusters. a total of 82 distinct a. actinomycetemcomitans  strains were identified. the serotype distribution pattern of the strains was 21  (25.6%) serotype a, 12 (14.6%) b, 41 (50%) c, 6 (7.3%) e, 1 (1.2%) f, and 1 (1.2%) non-typeable. for 14 subjects where multiple colonies of a. actinomycetemcomitans were identified, 11 subjects (78.6%) were each infected by  a single serotype, while the remaining three subjects (21.3%) were each infected  by two serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans. there was an inverse relationship between the level of cultivable a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. within subgingival plaque of study cohort a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype c was the dominant serotype and comprised 50% of all strains, followed by (in order of detection frequency) serotypes a and b. serotypes d, e, and f strains were either not detected or less frequently found. serotype distribution  patterns of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans may vary among subjects of different race orethnicity.

TI  == gram-negative periodontal bacteria induce the activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4, and cytokine production in human periodontal ligament cells.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a bacterially induced chronic inflammatory disease.  toll-like receptors (tlrs), which could recognize microbial pathogens, are important components in the innate and adaptive immune systems. both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses might result from different bacteria stimulation and the triggering of different tlrs. this study explores the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) with tlr2 and tlr4. methods: we studied the gene expression changes of tlr2 and tlr4 and cytokine production (interleukin-1beta, -6, -8, -10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in human periodontal ligament cells (hpdlcs) stimulated with heat-killed bacteria or p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) in the presence or absence of monoclonal antibodies to tlr2 or tlr4 (anti-tlr2/4 mab). results: both test bacteria and 10  microg/ml p. gingivalis lps treatment increased the gene expression of tlr2 and tlr4 and cytokine production in hpdlcs. in addition, these upregulations could be blocked by anti-tlr2/4 mab. however, the expression of tlr4 mrna in hpdlcs stimulated with 1 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps was not increased. no differences were found in the cytokine production caused by 1 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps treatment in the presence or absence of anti-tlr4 mab. conclusion: these patterns of gene expression and cytokine production indicate that gram-negative periodontal bacteria or their lps might play a role in triggering tlr2 and/or tlr4, and be of importance for the immune responses in periodontitis.

TI  == effects of a composition containing lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  == we report a clinical trial of the effects of test tablets containing bovine lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria. fifteen subjects with volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in mouth air above the olfactory threshold (h(2)s >1.5 or ch(3)sh >0.5 ng/10 ml) as detected by gas chromatography were enrolled in the trial. either a test or a placebo tablet was ingested twice  at 1-h intervals in two crossover phases. mouth air was monitored for vsc levels  at the baseline before ingestion of a tablet, 10 min after the first ingestion, 1 h (just before the second ingestion), and 2 h after the first ingestion. whole saliva was analyzed at the baseline and at 2 h for bacterial numbers. at 10 min,  the level of ch(3)sh was significantly lower in the test group (median [interquartile range] = 0.28 [0.00-0.68] ng/10 ml) compared to that in the placebo group (0.73 [0.47-1.00] ng/10 ml; p = 0.011). the median concentration of ch(3)sh in the test group was below the olfactory threshold after 10 min until 2  h, whereas the level in the placebo group was above the threshold during the experimental period. no difference in the numbers of salivary bacteria was detected by culturing or quantitative pcr, but terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism detected one fragment with a significantly lower copy number  at 2 h in the test group (mean +/- standard error, 4.89 +/- 0.11 log(10) copies/10 microl) compared to that in the placebo group (5.38 +/- 0.15 log(10) copies/10 microl; p = 0.033). these results indicate a suppressive effect of the  test composition on oral malodor and suggest an influence on oral bacteria.

TI  == the recolonization hypothesis in a full-mouth or multiple-session treatment protocol: a blinded, randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: to test recolonization of periodontal lesions after full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) or multiple session-srp (ms-srp) in a randomized clinical trial and whether fm-srp and ms-srp result in different clinical outcomes. materials and methods: thirty-nine subjects were randomly assigned to fm-srp or ms-srp groups. at baseline and after 3 months, probing pocket depth (ppd), plaque index (pli) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. at baseline, immediately after treatment, after 1, 2, 7, 14 and 90 days, paper point samples from a single site from the maxillary right quadrant were collected for microbiological analysis of five putative pathogens by polymerase chain reaction. results: fm-srp and ms-srp resulted in significant reductions in ppd, bop and pli and the overall detection frequencies of the five species after 3 months without significant differences between treatments. compared with ms-srp, fm-srp resulted in less recolonization of the five species, significantly for treponema denticola, in the tested sites. conclusion: fm-srp and ms-srp result in overall clinically and microbiologically comparable outcomes where recolonization of periodontal lesions may be better prevented by fm-srp.

TI  == effects of resveratrol on expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in human gingival fibroblasts stimulated by periodontal pathogens.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) in human gingival fibroblast culture in response to vesicles and outer membrane proteins from periodontopathic bacteria. material and methods: human gingival fibroblasts were stimulated with vesicles and outer membrane proteins from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. in human gingival fibroblast cultures treated with or without resveratrol, vegf production was evaluated by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and vegf mrna expression by means of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis.  vascular permeability enhancement was measured by the leakage of intravenously injected dye at the injection site of supernatant from cultures of human gingival fibroblasts stimulated by vesicles and outer membrane proteins. results: resveratrol significantly inhibited the increased production of vegf by human gingival fibroblasts in response to vesicles and outer membrane proteins from periodontopathic bacteria, as shown by the detection of these proteins and their  mrna in vitro. moreover, resveratrol treatment significantly decreased vascular permeability enhancement induced by supernatant from human gingival fibroblast cultures stimulated by vesicles and outer membrane proteins. conclusions: overall, these findings suggest that resveratrol inhibits production of vegf by stimulated human gingival fibroblasts and can inhibit vascular permeability, suggesting a therapeutic role for it in pathogenic bacteria-induced periodontal inflammation.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == communication: antimicrobial activity of smap28 with a targeting domain for porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == antibiotic therapy is often used with mechanical therapy to treat periodontal disease. however, complications associated with antibiotic use can occur. a 'bacteria-specific' targeted approach would eliminate some of these complications and kill specific periodontopathogens without harming the commensal bacteria. one such approach is to couple antimicrobial peptides to a ligand, pheromone, or antibody specific for the periodontopathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. to assess the feasibility of this approach, we attached pqgppq, a peptide from proline-rich protein 1 to either the n-terminus of smap28 (peptide zs37-37) or the c-terminus  of smap28 (peptide zs37-38) to see whether it has potential as a carrier ligand to deliver smap28 to the surface of p. gingivalis. for escherichia coli and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, the median minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of zs37-37 was higher than the median of smap28 alone, although the median mic of zs37-38 was lower than that of smap28 alone. for p. gingivalis, there was no difference in the median mic values. for s. aureus, the  median mic was higher for zs37-37 and zs37-38 compared to smap28 alone, particularly for zs37-38. for fusobacterium nucleatum, the median mic values were equal for zs37-37 and zs37-38 and higher than the median mic for smap28 alone. attaching pqgppq to smap28 did not greatly increase the antimicrobial activity of zs37-37 or zs37-38 for p. gingivalis nor substantially decrease the antimicrobial activity of zs37-37 or zs37-38 for the four other microorganisms tested. this is  an initial step to develop a selective antimicrobial agent that has 'targeted' antimicrobial activity without adverse reactions often associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

AB  == background: crohn's disease (cd) was reported to have oral manifestations. however, data on periodontal parameters and oral microbiology in cd are rare. recent studies showed associations of variants in the caspase recruitment domain  (card)15 gene with cd that are involved in the immune response toward bacterial products. our aim is to investigate the periodontal status and prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with cd under consideration of the card15 polymorphism. methods: oral soft tissue alterations and periodontal parameters of 147 patients with cd were assessed. subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for  the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa; previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella  forsythia (tf; previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia (pi), and campylobacter rectus (cr ) using dot-blot hybridization. card15 genotyping was performed with the a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based assay. results: a total of 36.7% of patients had oral manifestations predominated by gingival swellings (27.2%) and hyperplastic lesions of the buccal mucosa (20.4%). the mean probing depth and mean clinical attachment level were 3.6 and 3.8 mm, respectively. a total of 57.8% of the patients had a community periodontal index  of treatment needs (cpitn) score 3, and 31.3% of had a cpitn score 4. the prevalence of aa, pg, pi, tf, and cr was 76.9%, 62.6%, 79.6%, 64.6%, and 94.6%, respectively. pi was significantly less frequent in carriers of card15 mutations  compared to the wild type (69.7% versus 87.7%; p = 0.008). all other pathogens and clinical periodontal parameters did not differ significantly as to the card15 polymorphism. conclusions: our findings suggest that patients with cd have an increased prevalence and moderate severity of periodontitis. the colonization of  periodontal pathogens, in particular cr, might be of particular value for the periodontal manifestation of cd. although a modulating impact on periodontal microbiota can be supposed, our data do not support the role of card15 in oral symptoms and periodontal lesions in patients with cd.

TI  == profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microflora from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with periodontitis using quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == background and objective: qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. the aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. the amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time pcr using universal and species-specific  primers, respectively. results: the proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). among obligate anaerobes, tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. by contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). specifically, the proportion of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis or e. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. conclusion: obligate anaerobes, including t. forthysia, p. gingivalis and e. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas  streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. the proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.

AB  == background and objective: periodontitis is influenced by specific host-dependent  immune responses. periodontopathogens induce innate immune responses, amongst others, via toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), resulting in activation of the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab). the aim of this case-control study was to evaluate links between genetic variants of these genes  and chronic/aggressive periodontitis in a multivariate model. material and methods: a total of 141 patients with periodontitis (63 with chronic periodontitis and 78 with aggressive periodontitis) and 81 controls without periodontitis were included in the study. polymorphisms in tlr2 (arg677trp, arg753gln) and in nf-kappab (-94ins/delattg) were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and fragment length analyses, respectively. subgingival bacterial colonization was evaluated using a pcr/dna probe test (micro-ident). results: although there was no association of the tlr2 polymorphism arg753gln with periodontitis, heterozygous carriers (arg/gln) were at a higher risk for colonization with bacteria of the 'red complex' (corrected p-value = 0.042). the del/del genotype of the nf-kappab polymorphism was associated with aggressive periodontitis considering age, gender, smoking and approximal plaque index as potential confounders (odds ratio = 2.81, p = 0.035, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-7.33). del/del carriers had a higher risk for subgingival colonization with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio = 2.36, p = 0.030, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-5.1; adjusted for age, gender, smoking and pocket depth(bacteria)). conclusions: the del/del genotype of nf-kappab was shown to be associated with the occurrence of aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7+/-7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8+/-8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == a novel bioactivity of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and their ester derivatives.
AB  == fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufa), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as  an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. while n-3 pufa have  been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. the n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and alpha-linolenic acid (ala), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, alaee, epaee, dhaee were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. this study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three  major n-3 pufa, epa, dha, and ala, and their ester derivatives. our experimental  data indicated that n-3 pufa and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. this study suggested that n-3 pufa could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  == short-term effects of systemic antibiotics during periodontal healing.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the short-term effects of nonsurgical therapy (scaling and root planing, srp) on the subgingival microbiota in chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontal disease. method and materials: ninety-seven cp and ap subjects underwent full-mouth srp on 2 consecutive days. ap patients were randomly assigned to either receive systemic metronidazole plus amoxicillin (ap+ab) or were treated mechanically alone (ap). pathogens were identified with 16s rrna oligodeoxynucleotide probes and dot-blot hybridization before and at days 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 21 of healing. cp subjects were treated by scaling and root planing along with placebo tablets. results: initially, ap cell counts were  69.9- (porphyromonas gingivalis), 10.2- (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans),  5.7- (tannerella forsythia), and 3.3-fold (prevotella intermedia) enhanced compared to cp cell counts. following srp, immediate elimination occurred in single individuals of all three treatment groups at day 2. after srp plus antibiotic therapy (ap+ab), the prevalence scores dropped beyond the levels of ap and cp, beginning at day 7, and remained low until day 21 (p =or< .05). clinical  healing statistically benefited from srp with no differences among the three treatment groups. conclusion: nonsurgical therapy resulted in both a suppression  and early elimination of single taxa immediately after completion of active treatment. systemic antibiotics significantly accelerate the suppression of the periodontal microflora, but have limited effect on the elimination of target isolates during healing.

TI  == photodynamic therapy in periodontal therapy: microbiological observations from a  private practice.
AB  == in recent years, the combination of laser light and photosensitizer known as photodynamic therapy (pdt) has been used in periodontal therapy. however, there are not enough clinical studies to fully evaluate the effects of pdt on the periodontal tissues. this microbiological study examined the effects of pdt on the periodontal bacteria in combination with scaling and root planing (srp) in the same group of patients by randomly selecting pdt or srp for use in different  quadrants of the mouth. for the present study, pdt was compared with a diode laser (980 nm) and an nd:ya g laser (1,064 nm). microbiological samples were examined and evaluated over a period of three months. significant bacterial reduction has been observed in all cases. the diode laser with srp presented long-term positive results, while pdt showed a significant bacteria reduction during the entire observation period.

TI  == regulation of type i plasminogen activator inhibitor in human gingival fibroblasts with cyclosporine a.
AB  == objectives: cyclosporine a (csa) is used as an immunosuppressive agent and its prominent side effect is the induction of gingival overgrowth. type i plasminogen activator inhibitor (pai-1) has shown to play an important role in csa-induced gingival overgrowth. however, little is known about whether factors can modulate  csa-induced pai-1 expression. methods: cytotoxicity, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to investigate the effects of human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs) exposed to csa. in addition, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, interlukin-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor u0126, signal-regulated protein kinase (erk) inhibitor pd98059 and cell-permeable glutathione precursor n-acetyl-l-cysteine (nac) were added to test how they modulated the effects of csa-induced pai-1 expression. results: the concentration of csa higher than 500 ng ml(-1) demonstrated cytotoxicity to hgfs (p < 0.05). periodontal pathogens as  well as proinflammatory cytokines were found to increase the csa-induced pai-1 mrna and protein expression (p < 0.05). pharmacological agents nac, u0126, and pd98059 were found to decrease the csa-induced pai-1 mrna and protein expression  (p < 0.05). conclusions: cyclosporine a (csa) may predispose to gingival overgrowth under inflammatory environments. the regulation of pai-1 expression induced by csa might be critically related with the intracellular glutathione and the erk-mapk pathway.

TI  == efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: twenty-eight patients were randomly included. the test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. in addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (p <0.05) in both groups. there was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (p <0.05). total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (p <0.05). t. denticola and t. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. t. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. p. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (p <0.05), whereas t. forsythia was the only  pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (p <0.05). conclusions: the  results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. the polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in t. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that t. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.

TI  == quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens in female patients with and without chronic periodontitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a highly prevalent endogenous polymicrobial disease. to  better understand the etiology of the disease a quantitative approach is mandatory and real-time pcr is the molecular technique currently preferred to achieve this purpose. taking into account that such a kind of study is still scarce, we aimed to evaluate the association between periodontal microbiota and chronic periodontitis. a total of 60 low-income age-matched female adults, 30 with chronic periodontitis and 30 without periodontal disease, were enrolled. dna obtained from subgingival specimens was used for quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia by real-time pcr.  a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum were detected in all subjects, p. gingivalis was observed in 70.0% and 46.6% and p. intermedia in 90.0% and 80.0% of chronic periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy subjects, respectively. p. gingivalis mean count was significantly higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in periodontally healthy individuals. accurate detection and quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens was  feasible using a simple and fast real-time pcr protocol. although p. gingivalis and p. intermedia have been found more commonly in chronic periodontitis patients, no statistical difference was observed between periodontally diseased and healthy groups. quantitative data indicated association between p. gingivalis and chronic periodontitis. however, because of its uneven distribution, it should not be solely taken as a marker of periodontal status.

TI  == the relationship between physiologic halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria of the tongue and gingival sulcus.
AB  == to determine the influence of oral status on halitosis, the relationship between  halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria present in plaque on the tongue and the subgingival sulcus was examined in 62 periodontally healthy adults. halitosis indicators used were the organoleptic score; gas chromatography results [total volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) = h(2)s + ch(3)sh + (ch(3))(2)s]; halimeter values; and the results of three clinical tests, plaque control record (plcr), plaque index (pli), and tongue coat status. significant correlations with organoleptic scores was observed for plcr, pli, tongue coat status, vsc amounts,  and halimeter values, indicating that halitosis in periodontally healthy subjects tended to originate from tongue plaque deposits. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect six periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola) from the tongue and subgingival plaque. significant effects on the organoleptic scores, tongue coat status, total vsc, h(2)s and ch(3)sh amounts, and halimeter values were observed only for t. denticola and f. nucleatum and only in the tongue plaque, not in the subgingival plaque. thus, therapies developed to inhibit the growth of these bacteria may lead to future treatments of halitosis.

TI  == periodontitis, periodontopathic bacteria and lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin (lf) is a component of saliva and is suspected to be a defense factor against oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans and candida albicans. periodontitis is a very common oral disease caused by periodontopathic bacteria.  antimicrobial activities and other biological effects of lf against representative periodontopathic bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia, have been widely studied. association of polymorphisms in lf with incidence of aggressive periodontitis and the role of lf in the gingival crevicular fluid as a marker of periodontitis severity have also been reported. periodontopathic bacteria reside as a biofilm in supragingival and subgingival plaque. our recent study indicated that lf exhibits antibacterial activity against planktonic forms of p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia at higher concentrations, and furthermore, lf effectively inhibits biofilm formation and reduces the established biofilm of these bacteria at physiological concentrations. a small-scale clinical study indicated that oral administration of bovine lf reduces p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the subgingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients. lf seems to be a biofilm inhibitor of periodontopathic bacteria in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of moxifloxacin against gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: gram-negative enteric rods were associated with periodontal diseases  in several populations. the association between enteric and putative periodontal  pathogens has received little attention in the literature. the present investigation determined the occurrence and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: clinical parameters and the in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods were examined in 76 patients with chronic periodontitis in medellin, colombia. subgingival samples were processed using culture and biochemical tests for the detection of periodontal and superinfecting pathogens. selected colonies of gram-negative enteric rods from pure cultures were used to test the susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. chi-square and mann-whitney tests were used to determine differences in clinical variables versus the presence or absence of gram-negative enteric rods. results: klebsiella pneumoniae was found in 12 patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in four patients, and three other species were recovered with a lower prevalence. men (38.75%) tended to harbor more of the studied organisms than women (17.7%) (p = 0.04). gram-negative enteric rods in periodontal pockets correlated positively with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (respectively, r = 0.66, 0.31, and 0.32; p <0.001). all superinfecting organisms demonstrated a high susceptibility to moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin but exhibited a variable susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. conclusions: this study found high levels of gram-negative enteric rods in  patients with chronic periodontitis. moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin appeared capable of eradicating these organisms from periodontal pockets. its good activity against gram-negative enteric rods and periodontopathogens suggests the  potential use of moxifloxacin as an adjunctive antibiotic in the treatment of mixed periodontal infections.

TI  == epithelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokine response differs across dental plaque bacterial species.
AB  == aim: the dental plaque is comprised of numerous bacterial species, which may or may not be pathogenic. human gingival epithelial cells (hgecs) respond to perturbation by various bacteria of the dental plaque by production of different  levels of inflammatory cytokines, which is a putative reflection of their virulence. the aim of the current study was to determine responses in terms of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 secretion induced by porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus gordonii in order to gauge their virulence potential. materials and methods: hgecs were challenged with the four bacterial species, live or heat killed, at various multiplicity of infections and the elicited il-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 responses were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: primary hgecs challenged with live p. gingivalis produced high levels of il-1beta, while challenge with live a. actinomycetemcomitans gave high levels of  il-8. the opportunistic pathogen f. nucleatum induces the highest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the commensal s. gordonii is the least stimulatory. conclusion: we conclude that various dental plaque biofilm bacteria  induce different cytokine response profiles in primary hgecs that may reflect their individual virulence or commensal status.

TI  == microbiologic testing and outcomes of full-mouth scaling and root planing with or without amoxicillin/metronidazole in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. the main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp) within 48 hours. methods: this was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours;  then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three  times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: forty-seven patients  were followed for 6 months. after treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; p = 0.005; month 6). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. however, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.013) and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.007). however, even subjects testing negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. the presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum spp., p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and t. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth srp with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.

TI  == evaluating clinical periodontal measures as surrogates for bacterial exposure: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest).
AB  == background: epidemiologic studies of periodontal infection as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease often use clinical periodontal measures as a surrogate for the underlying bacterial exposure of interest. there are currently no methodological studies evaluating which clinical periodontal measures best reflect the levels of subgingival bacterial colonization in population-based settings. we investigated the characteristics of clinical periodontal definitions that were most representative of exposure to bacterial species that are believed  to be either markers, or themselves etiologic, of periodontal disease. methods: 706 men and women aged >or= 55 years, residing in northern manhattan were enrolled. using dna-dna checkerboard hybridization in subgingival biofilms, standardized values for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were averaged within mouth and summed to define "bacterial burden". correlations of bacterial burden with clinical periodontal constructs defined by the severity and extent of attachment loss (al), pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed. results: clinical periodontal constructs demonstrating the highest correlations with bacterial burden were: i) percent of sites with bop (r = 0.62); ii) percent of sites with pd >or= 3 mm (r = 0.61); and iii) number of sites with  bop (r = 0.59). increasing pd or al severity thresholds consistently attenuated correlations, i.e., the correlation of bacterial burden with the percent of sites with pd >or= 8 mm was only r = 0.16. conclusions: clinical exposure definitions of periodontal disease should incorporate relatively shallow pockets to best reflect whole mouth exposure to bacterial burden.

TI  == differential effects of periopathogens on host protease inhibitors slpi, elafin,  scca1, and scca2.
AB  == objective: secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitors (slpi), elafin, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 and 2 (scca1 and scca2) are specific endogenous serine protease inhibitors expressed by epithelial cells that prevent tissue damage from excessive proteolytic enzyme activity due to inflammation. to determine the effects of various periopathogens on these protease inhibitors, we utilized human gingival epithelial cells (gecs) challenged with cell-free bacteria supernatants  of various periopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. design: the gene expression and secretion of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were determined using real-time pcr and elisa, respectively. the direct effects of periopathogens and p. gingivalis gingipain mutants on these inhibitors were examined in vitro by western blot. the effect on the innate immune response of gecs was measured by expression of antimicrobial peptides: human beta-defenisin-2 (hbd2) and chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 20 (ccl20). results: we found that slpi, scca2, elafin, hbd2,  and ccl20 gene expression levels were significantly induced (p<0.001) in response to p. gingivalis, whose virulence factors include cysteine proteases, but not in  response to stimulation by other bacteria. p. gingivalis reduced the secretion of slpi and elafin significantly in gecs, and degraded recombinant slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2. differential degradation patterns of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were observed with different bacteria as well as p. gingivalis mutants associated with the loss of specific gingipains secreted by p. gingivalis. in addition, pretreatment of gecs with slpi, scca1, or scca2 partially blocked hbd2  and ccl20 mrna expression in response to p. gingivalis, suggesting a protective effect. conclusion: our results suggest that different periopathogens affect the  host protease inhibitors in a different manner, suggesting host susceptibility may differ in the presence of these pathogens. the balance between cellular protease inhibitors and their degradation may be an important factor in susceptibility to periodontal infection.

TI  == analysis of microbiota associated with peri-implantitis using 16s rrna gene clone library.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis (pi) is an inflammatory disease which leads to the destruction of soft and hard tissues around osseointegrated implants. the subgingival microbiota appears to be responsible for peri-implant lesions and although the complexity of the microbiota has been reported in pi, the microbiota responsible for pi has not been identified. objective: the purpose of this study  was to identify the microbiota in subjects who have pi, clinically healthy implants, and periodontitis-affected teeth using 16s rrna gene clone library analysis to clarify the microbial differences. design: three subjects participated in this study. the conditions around the teeth and implants were evaluated based on clinical and radiographic examinations and diseased implants,  clinically healthy implants, and periodontally diseased teeth were selected. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets using sterile paper points. prevalence and identity of bacteria was analyzed using a 16s rrna gene clone library technique. results: a total of 112 different species were identified from 335 clones sequenced. among the 112 species, 51 (46%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 22 were novel phylotypes. the numbers of bacterial species identified at the sites of pi, periodontitis, and periodontally healthy implants were 77, 57, and 12, respectively. microbiota in pi mainly included gram-negative species and the composition was more diverse when compared to that of the healthy implant and periodontitis. the phyla chloroflexi, tenericutes, and synergistetes were only detected at pi sites, as were parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus stomatis, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and solobacterium moorei. low levels of periodontopathic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were seen in  peri-implant lesions. conclusions: the biofilm in pi showed a more complex microbiota when compared to periodontitis and periodontally healthy teeth, and it was mainly composed of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. common periodontopathic  bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens in pi.

TI  == nod1 and nod2 mediate sensing of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == in bacterial infection, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod) 1 and nod2 induce innate immune responses by recognizing fragments of the bacterial component peptidoglycan (pgn). to determine the roles of these receptors in detection of periodontal pathogens, we stimulated human embryonic kidney cells expressing nod1 or nod2 with heat-killed porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum or their soluble pgns (spgns). all bacteria and their spgns could stimulate activation of  nf-kappab. however, there were differences in nod1- and nod2-stimulatory activities among the species of bacteria. p. gingivalis showed weaker nod1- and nod2-stimulatory activities than did other bacteria. these differences in activities were confirmed by production of interleukin-8 from oral epithelial cells stimulated with spgns. these findings indicate that both nod1 and nod2 might be involved in the recognition of periodontal pathogens, and that the weak  nod-stimulatory property of p. gingivalis might be helpful for survival in the periodontal pocket.

TI  == association of human t lymphotropic virus 1 amplification of periodontitis severity with altered cytokine expression in response to a standard periodontopathogen infection.
AB  == background: periodontal diseases (pds) are infectious diseases in which periodontopathogens trigger chronic inflammatory and immune responses that lead to tissue destruction. recently, viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pds. individuals infected with human t lymphotropic virus 1 (htlv-1) present with abnormal oral health and a marked increased prevalence of periodontal disease. methods: in this study, we investigated the patterns of periodontopathogen infection and local inflammatory immune markers in htlv-1-seropositive individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp/htlv-1 group) compared with htlv-1-seronegative individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp group) and periodontally healthy, htlv-1-seronegative individuals (control group). results: patients in the cp/htlv-1 group had significantly higher values  of bleeding on probing, mean probing depth, and attachment loss than patients in  the cp group. the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (il)  4 was found to be similar in the cp and cp/htlv-1 groups, whereas il-12 and il-17 levels trended toward a higher expression in the cp/htlv-1 group. a significant increase was seen in the levels of il-1beta and interferon gamma in the cp/htlv-1 group compared with the cp group, whereas expression of the regulatory t cell marker foxp3 and il-10 was significantly decreased in the lesions from the cp/htlv-1 group. interestingly, similar frequency and/or load of periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) and frequency of viruses (herpes simplex virus 1, human cytomegalovirus, and epstein-barr virus) characteristically associated with pds were found in the cp/htlv and cp groups. conclusions: htlv-1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease through the deregulation of the local cytokine network, resulting in an exacerbated response against a standard periodontopathogen infection.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == bacterial colonization of the dental implant fixture-abutment interface: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: the geometry of the fixture-abutment interface (fai) might influence  the risk of bacterial invasion of the internal part of the implant. the aim of this study was to use an in vitro model to assess the potential risk for invasion of oral microorganisms into the fai microgap of dental implants with different characteristics of the connection between the fixture and abutment. methods: thirty implants were divided into three groups (n = 10 per group) based on their  microgap dynamics. groups 1 and 2 were comprised of fixtures with internal morse-taper connections that connected to standard abutments and the same abutments with a 0.5-mm groove modification, respectively. group 3 was comprised  of implants with a tri-channel internal connection. fixtures and abutments were assembled and allowed to incubate in a bacterial solution of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis. two standard abutments were either exposed to bacterial culture or left sterile to serve as positive and negative controls. after disconnection of fixtures and abutments, microbial samples were taken from the threaded portion of the abutment, plated, and allowed to culture under appropriate conditions. results: three of the 10 samples in group 1 developed one colony forming unit (cfu) for a. actinomycetemcomitans, whereas zero of 10 samples developed cfus for p. gingivalis. ten of 10 and nine of 10 samples from groups 2 and 3, respectively, developed multiple cfus for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis. conclusion: this study indicated that differences in implant designs may affect the potential risk for invasion of oral microorganisms into the fai microgap.

TI  == inhibitory effect of quercetin on periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) are bacteria strongly associated with early onset, progressive and refractory periodontal disease and associated alveolar bone loss. quercetin is a flavonoid found in many foods including apples, onions and tea. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of quercetin on in vitro growth of periodontal pathogens aa and pg. for comparison, quercetin's effect on several oral microbes was also evaluated. different concentrations of quercetin solution were added to calibrated suspensions of aa and pg. all suspensions were incubated for 1, 3, 6,  and 24 h in an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees c. at each time point, selected dilutions from each culture broth were plated on blood agar plates. colonies appearing on blood agar plates were visually counted on 3 days for aa and 5 days  for pg. minimum inhibitory concentrations of both periodontal pathogens were also determined. both periodontal bacteria showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in viable counts after 1 h. no colony forming units of pg could be observed after 24 h. the results suggest that quercetin possesses significant antimicrobial properties on periodontal pathogens in vitro.

TI  == changes in the incidence of periodontal pathogens during long-term monitoring and after application of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == the incidence of potential periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, formerly actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga ochracea) was monitored in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy control subjects. two types of studies were carried out in which the composition of the bacterial communities in different niches of the same oral cavity ecosystem was investigated. fluctuation or at least pronounced quantitative changes in the incidence of individual species in time were documented in the long-term study as well as after the local administration of antibacterial drug chlo-site or metronidazole. even within two weeks, a turnover  of the monitored bacteria in separate niches of the oral biotope can be detected. a relatively high incidence of the tested periopathogens in the clinically healthy teeth of patients implies that even the "healthy" niches in the periodontal biotope function as a dynamic reservoir of periopathogenic microorganisms. this should be kept in mind when a local application of antibacterial compounds is used in the therapy of periodontal disease.

TI  == microbial profile of ligature-induced periodontitis in rats.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the biofilm accumulated around ligatures in rats by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using  probes made from human oral bacterial species. methods: 12 wistar rats were selected for this study. one of the mandibular first molars of each animal received a ligature, while the contralateral tooth was left unligated to be used  as a control. forty-two days later, the ligatures and one sample of biofilm from  each unligated teeth were analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for 40 human periodontal species. the area of bone loss in the furcation area was determined histometrically. results: the unligated teeth did not present any of the bacterial species tested. twenty five species were detected in the ligatures. streptococcus- and actinomyces-like species were found in high mean counts, followed by fusobacterium-, prevotella nigrescens- and parvimonas micra-like species and porphyromonas gingivalis- and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-like species. greater bone loss was observed in the furcation area of the ligated than of the unligated group (p<0.0001). conclusion: at 42 days, the ligature biofilm in rats presents various bacterial species that  hybridize to probes of periodontal bacterial species commonly observed in human.

TI  == do periodontopathogens disappear after full-mouth tooth extraction?
AB  == aim: to monitor the intra-oral microbiological changes after full-mouth extraction using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). material and methods: nine patients with severe, aggressive periodontitis, for whom a full-mouth tooth extraction was the only remaining treatment option were recruited. before and 6 months after extraction, microbial samples were obtained  (tongue, saliva and subgingival plaque) and analysed by qpcr. results: the elimination of subgingival niches, by extraction of all natural teeth, resulted in a 3-log reduction of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, and more modest reductions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia. however, the detection frequencies of these periodontopathogens in saliva and on the tongue remained unchanged after full-mouth tooth extraction. conclusion: in contrast to what has been believed so far, full-mouth tooth extraction does not result in eradication of all periodontopathogens but only in  a significant reduction. the clinical consequences of this observation remain speculative.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) a possible link between impaired oral health and acute myocardial infarction.
AB  == objective: to investigate if oral health parameters were impaired in patients with myocardial infarction (mi) and if there was an association with serum antibody levels against the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa). methods: a case-control study consisting of 100 patients with mi and 100 age- and sex-matched controls from the same geographic area was investigated regarding oral health. results: the mi group had significantly more periodontal bone loss (pbl), number of deepened pockets (ndp), and bleeding on probing (bop), and lower number of teeth (nt) than the controls. after adjustment for known cardiovascular risk factors nt, bop, and ndp still remained significantly related to mi (p=0.014, p=0.02, and p=0.0069, respectively). igg antibody levels against pg were higher in subjects with mi (p=0.043), as well as in those with >4 deepened pockets (p=0.05), bop>20% (p=0.001) and pbl (p=0.0003). however, indicating a causal pathway, the relationship between mi and pg igg disappeared when the oral parameters were included in the logistic regression model (p=0.69). no correlation was seen between mi and aa in the present study. conclusion: patients with mi had an impaired oral health compared to controls. furthermore, igg levels against pg were related to both mi and oral health, suggesting this pathogen as a possible link between oral health and cvd.

TI  == clinical status and detection of periodontopathogens and streptococcus mutans in  children with high levels of supragingival biofilm.
AB  == knowledge about the presence of some important oral pathogens is an important step in better identifying children at risk for periodontal and/or caries diseases in later life. the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of streptococcus mutans (sm), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), and tannerella forsythia (tf) in gingival biofilm samples from 196 children, and to assess whether any of these pathogens are more associated with gingival inflammation extension and the decayed/missing/filled teeth (dmft/dmft)  index. the subjects presented plaque index greater than 80% and were divided in 3 groups according to the bleeding index (bi): i) low bleeding (< 30%), ii) medium  bleeding (31 - 59%) and iii) high bleeding (> 60%). the presence of each pathogen was determined by pcr. the prevalence of sm was 71.9% and the mean dmft/dmft was  6.68. the prevalence in low, medium and high bleeding groups was 43.5%, 34.5% and 46.7% for aa; 43.5%, 37.9%, and 36.7% for cr; 99.1%, 100%, and 96.7% for pg; 56.5%, 56.9%, and 66.7% for pi; and 58.3%, 60.3%, and 56.7% for tf, respectively. pg (99.0%) was the most prevalent periodontal pathogen detected followed by tf (58.7%), pi (58.2%), aa (41.3%) and cr (40.8%). our study indicated that in this  high plaque index population studied, a high prevalence of sm and high mean dmft  were observed. in addition, the presence of pi was associated with the presence of inflammation (p < 0.05) whereas cr was associated with periodontal health (p < 0.05).

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == subgingival bacterial colonization profiles correlate with gingival tissue gene expression.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by the microbiota of the periodontal pocket. we investigated the association between subgingival bacterial profiles and gene expression patterns in gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis. a total of 120 patients undergoing periodontal surgery contributed with a minimum of two interproximal gingival papillae (range  2-4) from a maxillary posterior region. prior to tissue harvesting, subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesial and distal aspects of each tissue sample. gingival tissue rna was extracted, reverse-transcribed, labeled, and hybridized with whole-genome microarrays (310 in total). plaque samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations with respect to 11 bacterial species. random effects linear regression models considered bacterial levels as exposure and expression profiles as outcome variables. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: wide inter-species variation was noted in the number of differentially expressed gingival tissue genes according to subgingival bacterial levels: using  a bonferroni correction (p < 9.15 x 10(-7)), 9,392 probe sets were differentially associated with levels of tannerella forsythia, 8,537 with porphyromonas gingivalis, 6,460 with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, 506 with eikenella  corrodens and only 8 with actinomyces naeslundii. cluster analysis identified commonalities and differences among tissue gene expression patterns differentially regulated according to bacterial levels. conclusion: our findings  suggest that the microbial content of the periodontal pocket is a determinant of  gene expression in the gingival tissues and provide new insights into the differential ability of periodontal species to elicit a local host response.

AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the short-term performance of a session of single photodynamic therapy (pdt) and of a conventional ultrasonic debridement (ust) in persistent pockets of maintenance patients. in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical study, patients with chronic periodontitis with at least two persistent pockets (>4 mm) were enrolled. they were treated either with ust (n = 29) or pdt (n = 25). clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and after 3 months. for ust, the mean probing depth was reduced from 5.3 to 4.5 mm (p = <0.001) and for pdt from 5.3 to 4.7 mm (p < 0.001) with no difference between the two treatment modalities. microbial counts were significantly reduced about 30% to 40% immediately after debridement but returned to baseline values a 3 months irrespective of treatment. pdt is not superior to conventional mechanical treatment of persistent pockets, but it may be a meaningful therapeutic alternative; the clinical effects were too minor to draw a definitive conclusion.

TI  == differential ability of periodontopathic bacteria to modulate invasion of human gingival epithelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial infection caused by selected gram-negative bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis. host cell invasion by p. gingivalis  has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of periodontopathogens on p. gingivalis invasion of gingival epithelial cells in polymicrobial infection. p. gingivalis was tested for its ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell  line ca9-22 in co-infection with periodontopathogens, using an antibiotic protection assay. among the pathogens tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrated the ability to significantly promote p. gingivalis invasion (p<0.01). this increased invasion was confirmed by confocal scanning laser microscopy utilizing a dual labeling technique. in contrast, co-infection with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or tannerella forsythia attenuated p. gingivalis invasion. the fusobacterial enhancement of host cell invasion was not  observed in co-incubation with other periodontopathogens tested. these results suggested that complex synergistic or antagonistic physiologic mechanisms are intimately involved in host cell invasion by p. gingivalis in polymicrobial infection.

TI  == analysis of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-8 and mmp-2) activity in gingival crevicular fluid from children with down's syndrome.
AB  == background and objective: high levels of colonization by periodontopathic bacteria and a high prevalence of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease have been reported in children with down's syndrome. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps)  are mediators of extracellular matrix degradation and remodelling, and are deeply involved in the course of periodontal disease. to clarify the relationship between down's syndrome and periodontitis, we investigated levels of mmp-2 and mmp-8 in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and detection of periodontopathic bacteria from subgingival plaque. material and methods: samples of gcf and plaque were isolated from central incisors. levels of mmps were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and periodontopathic bacteria were detected by polymerase chain reaction. results: levels of mmp-2 and mmp-8 in down's syndrome  patients were higher than those in healthy control subjects. in the down's syndrome group, increases in these mmps were observed in gcf from patients with an oral hygiene index score of < 2 and in gcf from sites that were negative for bleeding on probing. the detection rate of periodontopathic bacteria in down's syndrome patients was higher than that in the control subjects. matrix metalloproteinase-2 levels in sites harbouring porphyromonas gingivalis or aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans were lower than in those without these microorganisms. conclusion: these results suggest an increase in mmp-2 and mmp-8 in down's syndrome patients, regardless of whether inflammation of periodontal tissue is present or not.

AB  == background and objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of serum on the interaction of periodontal pathogens with epithelial cells using an epithelial cell line (kb cells). this is important because serum is a key component of gingival crevicular fluid and may influence inflammatory responses in epithelial cells exposed to periodontal pathogens. material and methods: porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans y4 were co-cultured with kb cells either with or without the addition of up to 10% human serum or 50 mg/ml human serum albumin. the numbers of free-floating, adherent and intracellular bacteria were determined up  to 18 h after exposure of the epithelial cells to the pathogens. additionally, the concentrations of interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 produced by the epithelial cells in response to exposure to the bacteria were determined. results: serum and human serum albumin reduced the number of internalized a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 organisms in the epithelial cells, increased the levels of il-6 and il-8 in the supernatants of infected cells (those with internalized a. actinomycetemcomitans) and influenced non-infected epithelial cells. increased il-6 and il-8 concentrations were also detected in the supernatants of kb cells infected with p. gingivalis atcc 33277. interleukin-6 and il-8 were detectable after addition of serum, probably as a result of inhibition of the activity of p. gingivalis cysteine proteinases by serum. conclusion: serum promotes the release  of the cytokines il-6 and il-8 by epithelial cells. this mechanism is influenced  by periodontal pathogens and may maintain clinical periodontal inflammation.

TI  == infections as a stimulus for coronary occlusion, obstruction, or acute coronary syndromes.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis is considered to be an inflammatory disease. infections are a significant cause of inflammation. acute infections might precipitate acute coronary syndromes (acs) whereas chronic infections might be stimuli for the development of atherosclerosis. methods: coronary angiograms were done on 211 of 335 patients with acs and the percentage of coronary obstruction was determined. serum antibody levels to chlamydia pneumoniae, c. pneumoniae heat shock protein 60 (cpnhsp60), human heat shock protein 60 (hhsp60), enterovirus (ev), herpes simplex virus (hsv), cytomegalovirus (cmv), and two major periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, were measured in healthy controls (n = 355) and all patients. results: serum antibody levels to periodontal pathogens did not correlate with acs. however, iga-class antibody levels to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (p = 0.021), cpnhsp60 (p = 0.048) an hhsp60 (p = 0.038) were higher in patients with coronary occlusion or obstruction compared to those without any obstruction. odds ratios for coronary changes in the highest quartile as compared to the lower quartiles were for a. actinomycetemcomitans iga 7.84 (95% ci 1.02-60.39, p = 0.048), for cpnhsp60 iga 8.61 (1.12-65.89, p = 0.038), and for human hsp60 iga 3.51 (0.79-15.69, p = 0.100). conclusions: we have previously reported that ev and hsv titres correlated significantly to acute coronary events. they do not correlate to the degree of coronary obstruction as shown here. however, infection by a. actinomycetemcomitans or c. pneumoniae or host response against them associated with coronary obstruction. clinical coronary events may arise by the effect of acute infections and obstructing lesions by a chronic inflammatory stimulus.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == one-stage full-mouth versus partial-mouth scaling and root planing during the effective half-life of systemically administered azithromycin.
AB  == background: one-stage full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) in combination with systemically administered azithromycin was shown to be clinically and bacteriologically effective in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. however, fm-srp requires 2 hours for completion. azithromycin has a long half-life. therefore, if srp of the full mouth is performed within 7 days while an effective concentration of azithromycin remains in the gingiva, the effects may be the same as fm-srp. the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and bacteriologic effects of fm-srp and partial-mouth scaling and root planing (pm-srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis, which was performed in three sessions within 7 days,  during the effective half-life of systemically administrated azithromycin. methods: thirty adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into three groups (fm-srp, pm-srp, and control). a clinical examination was conducted to record the probing depth, clinical attachment level gain, bleeding on probing, gingival index, and volume of gingival crevicular fluid; bacterial samples were obtained before treatment and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months thereafter.  quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed using the polymerase chain reaction-invader method. results: all clinical parameters showed better improvement in fm-srp and pm-srp groups compared to the control group, with no significant differences between the two test groups. periodontal bacteria were well controlled in the two test groups, but they tended to increase gradually 3 months after treatment in the control group. conclusion: pm- and fm-srp demonstrated comparable clinical and bacteriologic results.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

TI  == quantification of periodontal pathogens by paper point sampling from the coronal  and apical aspect of periodontal lesions by real-time pcr.
AB  == the present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group a were taken first with a paper point half length (hp) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (fp) at the same site. in group b sampling sequence was reversed. analysis by real-time pcr enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (tbc). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman's correlations. higher  tbc could be harvested by use of fp than by hp (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, ci [-1.515, -0.068], sd 0.770, p =  0.034; after therapy: -0.563, ci [-1.151, 0.024], sd 0.625, p = 0.059). the plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. both, for tbc as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between hp and fp (kappa, spearman correlation: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). the recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of  the periodontal lesion.

TI  == influence of lingual orthodontic therapy on microbial parameters and periodontal  status in adults.
AB  == insertion of fixed orthodontic appliances can induce an increase in oral biofilm  and thereby cause inflammation of the periodontal tissues. the purpose of this study was to perform a longitudinal analysis of clinical and microbial parameters after insertion of lingual brackets. bleeding on probing (bop), plaque index (pi), and pocket probing depth (ppd) were measured in 10 adults (8 females and 2  males, aged 29.0 +/- 4.7 years) who received treatment with custom-made lingual appliances (incognito/ibraces) before (t0) and 3 months after beginning of treatment (t1). no supportive dental prophylaxis was undertaken. in addition, a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was used to detect aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) in the crevicular fluid. a wilcoxon test was used to compare clinical parameters at  the buccal (control) and lingual sites between t0 and t1. at t0, bop was 12.4 +/- 8.2 per cent, ppd 2.1 +/- 0.3 mm, and pi 0.1 +/- 0.2 at the buccal sites and at t1 14.3 +/- 8.1 per cent, 2.1 +/- 0.2 mm and 0.1 +/- 0.2, respectively. at the lingual sites, bop was 22.2 +/- 19.0 per cent, ppd 2.3 +/- 0.3 mm, and pi 0.1 +/- 0.2 at t0 and at t1 56.2 +/- 31.6 per cent, 2.9 +/- 0.3 mm, and 1.2 +/- 1.1, respectively. differences between t0 and t1 were significant for clinical parameters only at the lingual sites. aa was found in five patients at baseline and in four at t1, whereas pg was found in one patient at t0 and in two at t1. insertion of fixed lingual appliances without supportive dental prophylaxis induced a worsening of clinical parameters restricted to the lingual sites, whereas the relative prevalence of aa and pg remained unchanged.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative  detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

AB  == aim: to look for clinical signs of periodontal disease in young adults who exhibited radiographic bone loss and detectable numbers of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in their primary dentition. material and methods: periodontal status and radiographic bone loss were examined in each of the subjects 16 years after the baseline observations. techniques for anaerobic and selective culture, and checkerboard, were used to detect periodontitis-associated bacterial species. the isolated a. actinomycetemcomitans strains were characterized by polymerase chain reaction. results: signs of localized attachment loss were found in three out of the 13 examined subjects. a. actinomycetemcomitans was recovered from six of these subjects and two of these samples were from sites with deepened probing depths and attachment loss. among the isolated a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, serotypes a-c and e, but not d or  f, were found. none of the isolated strains belonged to the highly leucotoxic jp2 clone, and one strain lacked genes for the cytolethal distending toxin. conclusions: this study indicates that the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and early bone loss in the primary dentition does not necessarily predispose the  individual to periodontal attachment loss in the permanent dentition.

AB  == objectives: this study is intended to verify the correlation among clinical indices of the peri-implant soft tissues, the histological condition and the presence of 3 pathogens commonly associated with peri-implant diseases (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella  forsythia). materials: four clinical indices, gingival index (gi), sulcus bleeding index, gi modified by mombelli, and plaque index modified by mombelli (mpi) were evaluated around 1 dental implant of each subject (n = 10). subgingival plaque was collected for bacterial analysis (polymerase chain reaction) and a biopsy of peri-implant soft tissues for histological analysis was harvested. the clinical indices and detected pathogens correlated with a developed histological index (hi). results: there was no statistically significant relationship between the clinical indices (gi, sulcus bleeding index, and gi modified by mombelli) and the hi, except for the mpi on the central area of lingual aspects (r = 0.85, p = 0.0029). there was a tendency for a positive correlation between the mpi on the central area of buccal aspects and the hi (r = 0.63, p = 0.0544). the counting of lymphocytes and plasmocytes correlated positively with hi, thus suggesting the index reliability. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia did not present a significant relationship with the hi. conclusion: despite the small number of samples and the poor statistical significance, the mpi seems to be useful for evaluation of inflammatory severity on soft tissue around dental implants as demonstrated by its relationship with the hi. further studies are necessary to elucidate this subject.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the adjunctive clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic effects of the systemic administration of amoxicillin and metronidazole in the full-mouth ultrasonic debridement of patients with severe chronic periodontitis. methods: twenty-five patients presenting at least eight teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm and bleeding on probing (bop) were selected and randomly assigned to full-mouth ultrasonic debridement + placebo (control group) or full-mouth ultrasonic debridement + amoxicillin and metronidazole (test group). the clinical outcomes evaluated were  visible plaque index, bop, position of the gingival margin, relative attachment level (ral), and pd. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used for quantitative analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis). the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) technique permitted the detection of prostaglandin e(2,) interleukin-1beta, and interferon-gamma levels in gingival crevicular fluid. all  parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. results: at 6 months, the test treatment resulted in lower bop and an additional  reduction (0.83 mm) in pd (p <0.05). data also showed ral gain > or =2 mm at 43.52% of sites in control patients compared to 58.03% of sites in test patients  (p <0.05). however, both groups had similar mean ral gain (1.68 and 1.88 mm for the control and test groups, respectively). real-time pcr and elisa failed to identify significant differences between the groups. conclusions: both treatments resulted in significant clinical improvements; however, there was a slight, but significantly greater, improvement in bop and the percentage of sites with pd > or =5 mm exhibiting ral gain > or =2 mm in the test group. nevertheless, no improvement in the microbiologic or immunologic outcome was observed with the adjunctive use of systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole.

AB  == aim: the microbial profile of localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) has not yet been determined. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbial composition of lagp. material and methods: one hundred and  twenty subjects with lagp (n=15), generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp, n=25), chronic periodontitis (chp, n=30) or periodontal health (ph, n=50) underwent clinical and microbiological assessment. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and analysed for their content of 38 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: red complex  and some orange complex species are the most numerous and prevalent periodontal pathogens in lagp. the proportions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were  elevated in shallow and intermediate pockets of lagp subjects in comparison with  those with gagp or chp, but not in deep sites. this species also showed a negative correlation with age and with the proportions of red complex pathogens.  the host-compatible actinomyces species were reduced in lagp. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be associated with the onset of lagp, and porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum and prevotella intermedia play an important role in disease progression. successful treatment of lagp would involve a reduction in these pathogens and an increase in the actinomyces species.

TI  == inhibitory effect of galectin-3 on the cytokine-inducing activity of periodontopathic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans endotoxin in splenocytes derived from mice.
AB  == galectins, a family of animal lectins, are involved not only in development and differentiation but also in immunoregulation and host-pathogen interactions. galectin-3 interacts with lipopolysaccharides in gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella minnesota and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the present study investigated whether galectin-3 inhibited the cytokine-inducing activity of periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharides using splenocytes derived from mice of different ages. lipopolysaccharides were extracted from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans y4 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, and then purified. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) analysis revealed that galectin-3 adhered to a. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharides, but not to the lipopolysaccharides of p. gingivalis. splenocytes were prepared from 1- or 7-month-old c57bl/6 mice. either a. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharides (200 ng ml(-1)) alone or lipopolysaccharides and murine galectin-3 (10 microg ml(-1)) were added to culture solutions, and the release of interleukin-6 (il-6)  and interferon-gamma (ifngamma) from splenocytes was measured by elisa after a 17-h incubation. in all mice tested, a. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide  stimulation significantly increased the production of il-6 and ifngamma (p<0.01). murine galectin-3 suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production in the splenocytes of the 1-month-old mice (p<0.02 for il-6; p<0.05 for ifngamma), but not in the splenocytes of the 7-month-old mice. this suggests that responses  change with age.

TI  == detection and quantification of five major periodontal pathogens by single copy gene-based real-time pcr.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic multibacterial infection in the tooth-supporting tissues. it has been shown that periodontitis patients carry higher number of disease-associated bacteria than healthy ones. the aim of this study was to generate a novel, single copy gene-based quantitative real-time pcr  (qpcr) assay for five major periodontal pathogens - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. the primer/probe sets were designed for conservative lipopolysaccharide-coding gene regions. they proved to be sensitive  and able to detect strains representing different serotypes of the target bacteria. the specificity of designed primers was tested using 49 selected bacterial species and no false positive or negative results were observed. we validated the assay with a case-control population, including 165 saliva samples, and proved the diagnostic accuracy by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. all quantified pathogens alone were able to distinguish significantly between the subjects with and without periodontitis, and provided areas under the roc curve larger than 0.5. the total pathogen burden comprising all five species  associated with periodontitis with an area of 0.821 (95% ci, 0.758-0.885, p50.001). our prominently sensitive and specific assay may have major importance  in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == human gingival fibroblasts release high-mobility group box-1 protein through active and passive pathways.
AB  == introduction: the nuclear protein high-mobility group box-1 (hmgb1) acts as a late mediator of inflammation when secreted in the extracellular milieu. in this  study, we examined the effect of lipopolysaccharides from periodontal pathogens and apoptotic and necrotic cell death on hmgb1 production in human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). methods: hgf from healthy periodontal tissue were cultured and stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and escherichia coli. we also initiated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths in hgf. the hmgb1 released in the supernatants from stimulated or dying cells was measured. immunocytochemical staining against hmgb1 was performed in lps-stimulated hgf. results: a significantly higher amount of hmgb1 was detected from necrotic and apoptotic hgf. lps from a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and e. coli significantly  induced the production of hmgb1 in a time-dependent manner. after 6 h of lps stimulation, hmgb1 was present in the cytoplasm of cells whereas its location was mainly nuclear after 24 h. conclusions: lps from two major periodontal pathogens, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, induced hmgb1 secretion from hgf. apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths resulted in the enhancement of hmgb1. our results suggest that hgf can be a source of hmgb1 by both active secretion and passive release, and that hmgb1 from hgf may contribute to periodontal tissue destruction.

AB  == aim: to compare polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-ident test) and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and  3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: three hundred and fifty samples  were evaluated using both techniques. regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the pcr-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. the highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. conclusion: detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.

AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, infectious pathogenic bacteria found in oral biofilm, cause periodontal disease. the inhibitory effect of ajl-1, a galectin present in  the skin mucus of the japanese eel anguilla japonica, on biofilm formation by each of these strains was investigated by staining adherent bacteria on culture plates with crystal violet. an atp bioluminescence assay was used to determine whether inhibition of biofilm formation was due to the bactericidal activity of ajl-1. the effect of ajl-1 on cytokine induction in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (huvecs) by lipopolysaccharide (lps) isolated from a. actinomycetemcomitans was also investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  (elisa). ajl-1 significantly inhibited biofilm formation by a. actinomycetemcomitans strains y4, atcc 29523 and atcc 29524 but not by any strain of p. gingivalis or p. intermedia, and showed no bactericidal activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans strains. ajl-1 markedly suppressed interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 induction in huvecs by lps from a. actinomycetemcomitans strains y4 and atcc 29523. these observations indicate that ajl-1 is an effective inhibitor of biofilm formation by a. actinomycetemcomitans as well as of inflammatory cytokine induction in huvecs by lps. these finding indicate that ajl-1 may be of therapeutic value in a. actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontal diseases.

TI  == systemic immune responses in pregnancy and periodontitis: relationship to pregnancy outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study.
AB  == background: our previous studies reported on the obstetric, periodontal, and microbiologic outcomes of women participating in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study. this article describes the systemic antibody responses to selected periodontal bacteria in the same patients. methods: serum samples, obtained from pregnant women at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation) and 29 to 32 weeks, were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, women who delivered live preterm infants had significantly  lower total serum levels of igg antibody to the panel of periodontal pathogens (p = 0.0018), to p. gingivalis (p = 0.0013), and to f. nucleatum (p = 0.0200) than women who delivered at term. these differences were not significant at 29 to 32 weeks. changes in igg levels between baseline and 29 to 32 weeks were not associated with preterm birth when adjusted for treatment group, clinical center, race, or age. in addition, delivery of low birth weight infants was not associated with levels of antibody at baseline or with antibody changes during pregnancy. conclusions: live preterm birth is associated with decreased levels of igg antibody to periodontal pathogens in women with periodontitis when assessed during the second trimester. changes in igg antibody during pregnancy are not associated with birth outcomes.

TI  == interleukin-2 -330 and 166 gene polymorphisms in relation to aggressive or chronic periodontitis and the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-2 mediates  the activation, growth and differentiation of t and b lymphocytes and natural killer cells. promoter polymorphisms of the interleukin-2 gene have been associated with altered interleukin-2 production or identified as prognostic markers for various infectious diseases. therefore, the aim of this study was to  evaluate two polymorphisms at positions -330 t/g and 166 g/t in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (n = 58) or generalized aggressive periodontitis (n = 73) in comparison with periodontitis-free controls (n = 69). material and methods: both interleukin-2 polymorphisms were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. distributions of single alleles, genotypes and haplotypes were calculated using the chi-square test. risk factor analyses were carried out by logistic regression with respect to established cofactors for periodontitis. the presence of subgingival bacteria in  an individual were analyzed using a molecular biological method (the micro-ident  test). results: the interleukin-2 genotype -330 tg occurred less frequently in patients with chronic periodontitis (25.9% vs. 49.3%). moreover, this genotype decreased the adjusted odds ratio for chronic periodontitis (odds ratio = 0.394), whereas the interleukin-2 genotype 166 tt and the haplotype combination interleukin-2 -330,166 tt : tt were associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio (odds ratio = 2.82 or 2.97). for the latter interleukin-2 combination, a positive association for the subgingival presence of porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3% vs. 59.5%) and bacteria of the 'red complex' (78.1% vs. 56.0%) was shown.  conclusion: the interleukin-2 genotypes -330 tg and 166 tt, as well as the combination genotype interleukin-2 tt : tt, could be putative prognostic factors  for chronic periodontitis.

TI  == probiotic effects of orally administered lactobacillus salivarius wb21-containing tablets on periodontopathic bacteria: a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: this study was designed to evaluate whether the oral administration of lactobacilli could change the bacterial population in supra/subgingival plaque. material and methods: sixty-six healthy volunteers without severe periodontitis were randomized into two groups to receive lactobacilli or placebo for 8 weeks (8w): the test group (n=34) received 2.01 x 10(9) cfu/day of lactobacillus salivarius wb21 and xylitol in tablets; the control group (n=32) received placebo with xylitol. supra/subgingival plaque samples were collected at the baseline and after 4 weeks (4w) and 8w. the bacterial amounts in plaque samples were analysed  by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria in the test group was decreased significantly in subgingival plaque at 4w [odds ratio (or)=3.13, 95% confidence intervals (ci)=1.28-7.65, p=0.012]. multivariate analysis showed that significantly higher odds were obtained for the reduction of tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque of the test group at both 4w (or=6.69, 95% ci=2.51-17.9, p<0.001) and 8w (or=3.67, 95% ci=1.45-9.26, p=0.006). conclusion: oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli reduced the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria and could contribute to the beneficial effects on periodontal conditions.

TI  == human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus inhibit oral bacteria-induced macrophage activation and phagocytosis.
AB  == introduction: periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition caused by periodontal microorganisms. viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) and epstein-barr virus (ebv) are associated with certain types of periodontal disease, but their roles in promoting the disease are unclear. because both viruses infect human macrophages, cells which play key roles in the clearance of  pathogenic bacteria, it is likely that the viruses alter the functional capacity  of macrophages by inhibiting their defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. methods: macrophages preinfected with hcmv or ebv were evaluated following stimulation by selected oral bacteria. bacteria-induced macrophage activation was assayed by measuring the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) produced in the media, and phagocytic activity was analysed by a phagocytosis assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria. the virus-infected macrophages were also subjected to semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression of toll-like receptor 9, which is involved in the activation of phagocytosis-related pathways. results: both hcmv and ebv significantly diminished the tnf-alpha production typically induced by oral bacteria, inhibited the phagocytic activity of macrophages, and downregulated the expression of toll-like receptor 9. conclusion: infection by hcmv or ebv inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge, thereby  suggesting their pathogenic role in the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == role of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione catabolism.
AB  == introduction: our previous studies demonstrated that three enzymes, gamma-glutamyltransferase (ggt), cysteinylglycinase (cgase) and cystalysin, are required for the catabolism of glutathione to produce hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) in treponema denticola. in this study, we examined glutathione catabolism in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. methods: the ggt and cgase of a. actinomycetemcomitans were determined by biological methods and ggt was characterized using a molecular biological approach. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans showed ggt and cgase activity, but could not produce h(2)s  from glutathione. the addition of recombinant t. denticola cystalysin, an l-cysteine desulfhydrase, to whole cells of a. actinomycetemcomitans resulted in  the production of h(2)s from glutathione. subsequently, we cloned a. actinomycetemcomitans ggt gene (ggt) and overexpressed the 63 kda ggt protein. the recombinant a. actinomycetemcomitans ggt was purified and identified. the k(cat)/k(m) of the recombinant ggt from n-gamma-l-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline as substrate was 31/microm/min. the activity of ggt was optimum at ph 6.9-7.1 and enhanced by thiol-containing compounds. conclusion: the results demonstrated that a. actinomycetemcomitans had ggt and cgase activities and that the ggt was characterized. the possible role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione metabolism and h(2)s production from oral bacteria was discussed.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI  == red bacterial complex is associated with the severity of chronic periodontitis in a thai population.
AB  == background: the distribution of periodontal pathogens differs in various geographic locations and racial/ethnic groups. this study investigated the microbiological features of chronic periodontitis (cp) patients in thailand. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 20 non-periodontitis subjects, 20 patients with mild cp, and 20 patients with moderate to severe cp were examined using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to identify porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. results: in the moderate to severe cp patients, there was  high prevalence of p. gingivalis (95%), t. forsythia (95%), t. denticola (80%), as well as the red complex (coexistence of all three species at the same lesion)  (75%). a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only 35% of the patients in this  study group. p. gingivalis was detected in as high as 45% of the non-periodontitis controls. cp and disease severity were significantly related to the presence of t. forsythia together with t. denticola and the red complex. the  red complex was not found in any non-periodontitis site. conclusion: red complex  bacteria were predominant periodontal pathogens of the moderate to severe form of cp in this thai population. the presence of t. forsythia together with t. denticola, and the red complex species at the same site were significantly associated with the disease severity.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal bacteria as diagnostic markers of periodontitis.
AB  == background: assessment of periodontal conditions in epidemiologic studies usually requires a clinical examination, which is resource-intensive. we investigated the ability of serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies to periodontal bacteria to reflect clinical periodontal status. methods: we used checkerboard immunoblotting to assess serum igg levels to 19 species, including established/putative periodontal pathogens and non-pathogenic bacteria, in 5,747 dentate adults aged > or = 40 years who participated in the third national health and nutrition examination survey between 1988 and 1994. three earlier described alternative definitions of periodontitis were used, based on specific combinations of probing depth and attachment level values. optimized elevated titer thresholds and corresponding sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each definition. titers significantly associated with periodontitis were identified in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. parsimonious models were subsequently developed using age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes. results: in unadjusted models, high titers to porphyromonas gingivalis were most strongly associated with periodontitis across  all definitions (odds ratio, 2.07 to 2.74; p <0.05). in parsimonious models including demographic data, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes, high p. gingivalis titers were consistently associated with periodontitis, whereas high eubacterium  nodatum titers were associated with periodontal health in two of three definitions. receiver operating characteristic curves for the parsimonious multivariable models showed that the area under the curve ranged between 0.72 and 0.78. conclusions: serum igg titers to selected periodontal species, combined with demographic and behavioral characteristics, resulted in a moderately accurate classification of periodontal status in epidemiologic studies. the external validity of these findings must be examined further.

AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) binds to soluble (s)cd14. we investigated which factors  contribute to variations in scd14 levels in periodontitis, a chronic infectious disease of tooth-supporting tissues associated with endotoxemia and leading to inflammation and subsequently loss of teeth. the scd14 levels were determined by  elisa in healthy controls (n=57) and untreated patients (59 moderate and 46 severe) and their relation with markers of systemic inflammation (c-reactive protein levels, and leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts) was assessed. anti-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and anti-porphyromonas gingivalis igg  levels were established by elisa and cd14(-260) genotype was determined in a taqman allelic discrimination assay. increased levels of scd14 were more frequent among periodontitis patients (p=0.026) and showed a severity-dependence with increasing levels of periodontal breakdown (p=0.008). in patients, levels of scd14 correlated positively with crp (p=0.043), leukocyte numbers (p=0.011) and negatively with anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans igg (p=0.007). in a multivariate analysis, scd14 levels were predicted by ethnicity, age, educational level, and in caucasian subjects also by the severity of periodontal destruction, but not by anti-p. gingivalis igg or the cd14(-260) genotype. periodontitis is associated with elevated levels of scd14.

AB  == introduction: the current detection methods for periodontopathogens mainly use polymerase chain reactions. however, there are few methods available for visualizing the bacteria that impact on patients with periodontal disease for use in health education. the purpose of this study was to develop a specific detection method to visualize periodontopathogenic bacteria. methods: fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide probes directed to specific 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) sequences of porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were synthesized. cultured individual bacterial species were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and smeared on glass slides. fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotide probes were hybridized under stringent conditions with smeared whole cells, and then probe specificity was investigated  by epifluorescence microscopy. results: comparatively long (50-mer) oligonucleotide probes for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were designed. these probes clearly hybridized with 16s rrna of the target species in  situ and single bacterial cells were detectable visually. the probes exhibited no cross-hybridization against the additional organisms that were closely related to the target species. conclusions: the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique is a specific and reliable method by which to visually identify the target organisms. the oligonucleotide probes designed in this study will be useful for detecting p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans populations.

AB  == background and objective: this study analyzed the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans y4 with peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils taken from patients with aggressive periodontitis and chronic periodontitis. material and methods: peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils obtained from 12 patients with chronic periodontitis, six patients with aggressive periodontitis and 12 healthy  controls were exposed to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans following opsonization of the bacteria using the patient's own serum. serum immunoglobulin  g (igg) levels against both periodontopathogens were measured. phagocytosis and killing of the bacteria, as well as the extracellular human neutrophil elastase activity, were quantified. the total amount and the extracellular release of reactive oxygen species were measured using luminol-dependent and isoluminol-dependent chemiluminescence. results: polymorphonuclear neutrophils from patients with chronic (62.16 +/- 19.39%) and aggressive (43.26 +/- 26.63%) periodontitis phagocytosed more p. gingivalis than the healthy controls (24.43 +/- 19.87%) at the 30-min time point after exposure to the bacteria (p < 0.05). high serum igg levels against p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in subjects with periodontitis. polymorphonuclear neutrophils from subjects with chronic and aggressive periodontitis released significantly more reactive oxygen species and demonstrated greater human neutrophil elastase activity in the absence of any stimulus than polymorphonuclear neutrophils from healthy controls (p < 0.05). polymorphonuclear neutrophils in chronic periodontitis released significantly more reactive oxygen species when exposed to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans than polymorphonuclear neutrophils in  aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: high serum igg levels against p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans promote phagocytosis in periodontitis. the extracellular release of reactive oxygen species and neutrophil elastase by polymorphonuclear neutrophils may also contribute to damage of the surrounding periodontal tissues.

AB  == objective: the aim was to compare the effect of scaling and root planing (srp) alone, diode laser treatment (las) alone, and srp combined with las (srp + las) on clinical and microbial parameters in patients with aggressive periodontitis. materials and methods: thirty patients with aggressive periodontitis were assessed for plaque, bleeding on probing (bop), probing pocket depth (ppd), and clinical attachment level (cal). four plaque samples were randomly obtained, one  from each quadrant that was randomly assigned to srp alone, srp + las, las alone, and control (crl). a 980-nm diode laser was used in continuous mode at 2 w power. plaque samples were collected 2 wk, 12 wk, and 6 mo post-treatment. the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, and total bacterial load (tbl) were evaluated using ssrrna probes. results: bacterial counts were decreased with all  three treatment modalities and they did not reach baseline levels at 6 mo post-treatment. the srp + las group showed statistically significantly lower tbl  and bacterial levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola at 6 mo post-treatment compared to srp or las treatments alone. at the end of the observation period significant differences were observed for ppd and cal between the srp + las group and both the srp alone and las alone groups. no differences were detected for percentage of plaque and percentage of bop between any of the treatment groups at 6 mo post-treatment. conclusions: within the limits of this study, diode laser-assisted treatment with srp showed a superior effect over srp or las alone  for certain microbial and clinical parameters in patients with aggressive periodontitis over the 6-mo monitoring period.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and the hla-dqb1 allele are associated with susceptibility to periodontal disease in japanese adolescents.
AB  == periodontal disease is a multiple factor disease caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and periodontal bacteria (periodontal pathogens). the present study aimed to elucidate the risk factors for periodontal disease in japanese adolescents. subjects (11-16 years old) were classified into three groups: localized aggressive periodontitis (lap), periodontal attachment loss (pal), and periodontally healthy (ph) groups. genomic dna isolated from the buccal mucosa was used for single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the candidate genes (interleukin-1alpha-889; interleukin-1alpha +4845; interleukin-1beta +3954; an immunoglobulin g fc gamma receptor, fcgammariia-r/h131; and a human leukocyte antigen class ii allele, hla-dqb1) of aggressive periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples obtained from the same subjects were used for 16s rrnabased polymerase chain reaction analysis of five important periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). tannerella forsythia was detected in the deepest periodontal pockets in all subjects in the lap and pal groups. the prevalence of  an atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 of the lap group was significantly higher than that in the ph and pal groups. furthermore, all subjects who had the  atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 had t. forsythia infection. these results suggested that t. forsythia is associated with periodontal disease in japanese adolescents and also suggested that hla-dqb1 is related to lap and is associated with t. forsythia infection.

TI  == the upregulation of cystatin c in human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with cyclosporine a.
AB  == background and objective: cystatin c is a 13 kda non-glycosylated, basic protein  belonging to the cystatin family. it is consistently and dramatically upregulated in a variety of fibrotic diseases. however, little is known about the correlation between cystatin c and cyclosporine a-induced gingival overgrowth. the aim of this study was to compare cystatin c expression in normal, healthy gingival tissues and cyclosporine a-induced gingival overgrowth specimens and further explore the potential mechanism that may result in cystatin c expression. material and methods: fifteen cyclosporine a-induced gingival overgrowth specimens and five normal gingival tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry. three human gingival fibroblast (hgf) strains were established from crown-lengthening surgery. the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate the effects on hgfs exposed to cyclosporine a. in addition, predominant periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis) and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were added to seek the possible regulatory mechanisms of cystatin c expression. results: the cystatin c  staining in gingival tissue was stronger in the cyclosporine a-induced gingival overgrowth group than in the normal gingival group (p < 0.05). intensive staining for cystatin c expression was observed mainly in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts, epithelial cells and inflammatory cells. moreover, cystatin c expression was significantly higher in cyclosporine a-induced gingival overgrowth specimens with higher levels of inflammatory infiltrates (p < 0.05). a concentration of 200 ng/ml cyclosporine a was found to increase cystatin c expression in hgfs in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.05). the addition of periodontal pathogens and proinflammatory cytokines significantly increased the expression of cystatin c compared with cyclosporine a alone (p < 0.05). conclusion: the increased ability  of protein accumulation by cystatin c is one of several factors mediating cyclosporine a-induced gingival overgrowth. in addition, cyclosporine a may predispose to gingival overgrowth in inflammatory environments.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria and periodontal health status in  dental students.
AB  == objective: saliva may become a potential source of contamination through vertical and horizontal transmissions as well as cross-infections. this study aims to use  saliva as a screening tool to detect putative periodontal pathogens in a young population with fairly good oral hygiene. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 134 dental students (20.5+/-1 years, range 18-22 years). among those, 77 subjects also completed a periodontal examination including attachment loss, modified dental, gingival and plaque indices (al, mdi, gi and pi). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. results: one or more of the test bacteria was found in 67% of the subjects. prevotella nigrescens was detected as single bacterium in 16% of the subjects followed by treponema denticola (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (2%), aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (1%) and tannerella forsythia (1%). two or more pathogens were detected in 42% of the subjects. clinical examination revealed health with no attachment loss (al) in 84% of the students. in no al group, 38% of the students were pathogen free while this was 25% for students in localized al group (p>0.05). there was a statistically significant association between the detection of salivary periodontal pathogen in general and higher pi (p=0.018) and gi (p=0.043). conclusion: within the limits of this study, it is possible to detect all six periodontal pathogens in the saliva of dental students. although a correlation can be observed between the presence of salivary periodontal pathogen and clinical signs of inflammation such as plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding, detection of specific bacteria in saliva is not related to the presence of localized al based on the presented study population.

TI  == local application of tetracycline solution with a microbrush: an alternative treatment for persistent periodontitis.
AB  == objective: topical antibiotics may overcome shortcomings of mechanical therapy for localized persistent periodontitis. this double-center, single-blind, randomized controlled study aimed to evaluate the microbiologic profile and clinical parameters of persistent periodontal pockets after treatment with tetracycline solution. method and materials: thirty-seven patients who had at least 4 non-adjacent sites of persistent periodontal pockets with probing depth of at least 5 mm and bleeding on probing were randomly assigned to test and control groups. in the test group, 2 teeth received 4 applications of tetracycline solution (100 mg/ml) with a microbrush(t), while the other 2 teeth received the same treatment plus 1 session of scaling and root planing(srp+t). in the control group, 2 teeth received 1 session of scaling and root planing(srp), and the other 2 teeth received 4 applications of saline with a microbrush plus 1  session of scaling and root planing(srp+s). clinical parameters of probing depth, bleeding on probing, visible plaque index, gingival bleeding index, gingival recession, as well as clinical attachment level and subgingival plaque samples (evaluated by polymerase chain reaction) were measured at baseline and 1, 3, and  6 months. results: all therapies yielded statistically significant data on clinical measurements with no significant differences among groups. presence of bacteria decreased in both groups, but only in the test group was a significant decrease of porphyromonasgingivalis,tannerellaforsythia, and actinobacillusactinomycetemcomitans noted up to 6 months. conclusion: tetracycline applied with a microbrush may be an alternative treatment for persistent periodontitis that can probably be mediated by reduction of microorganism proliferation

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == detection of oral bacteria in cardiovascular specimens.
AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

AB  == background: plasma antibody measurements of antibody levels to periodontal pathogens may be used to support diagnosis, disease activity, classification, and prognosis of periodontitis. objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the long-term stability of plasma antibody levels against aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. design: plasma immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody levels against the pathogens were analyzed annually during 15 years from 21 voluntary subjects, whose periodontal status was not known at the point of selection. the total number of plasma samples was 315. in connection of  the last sampling, the clinical and radiographic periodontal status was examined. pooled bacterial samples from periodontal pockets, as well as salivary samples were collected for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis detection, and antibody determinations, respectively. according to the clinical status, six subjects had periodontitis, whereas 15 did not. results: plasma igg-class antibody levels to periodontal pathogens remained extremely stable during the 15-year period and no significant (p>0.05) intra-individual variations were observed. retrospectively, the average plasma igg antibody levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were 1.6-2.3 (p<0.05) and 1.4-1.7 (p<0.05) fold higher in the subjects with periodontitis than those without, respectively, during the whole 15-year tracking. as expected, at the time of the  periodontal examination the plasma and salivary igg antibody levels were associated both with periodontitis and bacterium-positivity. conclusions: plasma  igg levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis are extremely stable during 15 years both in subjects with and without periodontitis.

TI  == proteolytic activities of oral bacteria on prommp-9 and the effect of synthetic proteinase inhibitors.
AB  == tissue reactions to bacteria lead to proinflammatory reactions involving matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). synthetic protease inhibitors may offer new possibilities to regulate bacterial proteases. we investigated proteolytic activities of certain periodontal bacteria, their effects on the latent prommp-9, and the effects of synthetic mmp inhibitors and a serine protease inhibitor pefabloc. the strains studied were porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptoccus micros, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and 5 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. their gelatinolytic activities and the effects of certain synthetic mmp inhibitors and  pefabloc were analyzed by zymography. bacterial effects on prommp-9 conversion were investigated by western immunoblot. all investigated periodontal bacteria produced gelatinolytic cell-bound and extracellular proteinases which could fragment latent prommp-9, suggesting co-operative processing cascades in oral tissue remodeling. a. actinomycetemcomitans produced the weakest gelatinolytic activity. synthetic proteinase inhibitors exhibited slight but clear reductive effects on the bacterial proteolytic activities. we conclude that targeted anti-proteolytic treatment modalities against bacterial-host proteolytic cascades can be developed.

TI  == tumor necrosis factor-alpha -308g/a single nucleotide polymorphism and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased periodontal tissues.
AB  == background and objective: inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a high between-subject variation in the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mrna has been verified, which may be a result of genetic polymorphisms and/or the presence of periodontopathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (called the red complex) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. in this study, we investigated the effect of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfa) -308g/a gene polymorphism and of periodontopathogens on the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking patients with chronic periodontitis (n = 127) and in control subjects  (n = 177). material and methods: the tnfa -308g/a single nucleotide polymorphism  was investigated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, whereas the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and the periodontopathogen load were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: no statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of the tnfa -308 single nucleotide polymorphism in control and chronic  periodontitis groups, in spite of the higher frequency of the a allele in the chronic periodontitis group. the concomitant analyses of genotypes and periodontopathogens demonstrated that tnfa -308 ga/aa genotypes and the red-complex periodontopathogens were independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in periodontal tissues, and no additive effect was seen when both factors were present. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola counts were positively correlated with the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. tnfa -308 genotypes were not associated with the periodontopathogen detection odds or with the bacterial load. conclusion: our results demonstrate that the tnfa -308 a allele and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis patients and consequently are potentially involved in determining the disease outcome.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathogen microorganisms by pcr technique].
AB  == introduction: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues  of teeth and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. the onset and progression  of periodontal disease is attributed to the presence of elevated levels of a consortium of pathogenic bacteria. gram negative bacteria, mainly strict anaerobes, play the major role. objective: the present study aimed to assess the  presence of the main types of microorganisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, tanerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia in different samples collected from the oral  cavity of 90 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. method: bacterial dna detection was performed in diverse biological materials, namely in dental plaque, gingival tissue and saliva, by means of multiplex pcr, a technique that allows simultaneous identification of two different bacterial genomes. results: in the dental plaque of the periodontitis patients, treponema denticola dominated. in the gingival tissue, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were the microbiota most frequently detected, whilst in saliva treponema denticola and eikenella corrodens were found with the highest percentage. conclusion: the identification of microorganisms by multiplex pcr is specific and sensitive. rapid and precise assessment of different types of periodontopathogens is extremely important for early detection of the infection and consequently for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. in everyday clinical practice, for routine bacterial evaluation in patients with periodontal disease, the dental plaque is the most suitable biological material, because it is the richest in periodontal bacteria.

TI  == differences in subgingival microflora of korean and german periodontal patients.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to characterize the microbiological profile in samples of subgingival plaque taken from periodontal patients with different ethnic origin. methods: 178 patients (n=90 from south korea and n=88 from germany; age: 45.4 +/- 10.4 years) were diagnosed with severe generalized periodontitis. in all patients the deepest pocket of each quadrant was sampled for subgingival plaque. the four samples per patient were pooled and subsequently analysed with a 16s-rna-gene probe test. results: prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in german patients (47.7%) compared to korean patients (26.7%) (p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). for tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis, differences between germans and koreans were not as pronounced. a statistically significant difference could also be found for treponema denticola (germans: 95.5%, koreans: 81.1%, p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). after logarithmic transformation, bacterial counts differed for all microorganisms under investigation between germans and koreans, even after using  a general linear model/analysis of covariance (glm/ancova) to adjust for gender,  age, smoking status, pocket probing depths (ppd) of sampled teeth, and gingival bleeding index (gbi). conclusion: depending on their ethnic origin, the microbiological profile of pooled subgingival plaque sample seems to differ significantly between patients of caucasian and asian ethnic origin.

TI  == detection of herpesviruses and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis, generalized aggressive periodontitis, or gingivitis.
AB  == background: herpesviruses may be related to the etiology of aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp) by triggering periodontal destruction or by increasing the risk for bacterial infection. this case-control  study evaluated the presence of herpes simplex virus type i (hsv-1), epstein-barr virus type i (ebv-1), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) in patients with generalized agp (agp group), cp (cp group), or gingivitis (g group) and in healthy individuals (c group). methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected with paper points from 30 patients in each group. the nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was used to detect  hsv-1, ebv-1, and hcmv. bacteria were identified by 16s rrna-based pcr. results:  hsv-1, hcmv, and ebv-1 were detected in 86.7%, 46.7%, and 33.3% of the agp group, respectively; in 40.0%, 50.0%, and 46.7% of the cp group, respectively; in 53.3%, 40.0%, and 20.0% of the g group, respectively; and in 20.0%, 56.7%, and 0.0% of the c group, respectively. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected significantly more often in the agp group compared to the other groups (p <0.005). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were identified more frequently in agp and cp groups, and agp, cp, and g groups had higher frequencies of p. intermedia compared to the c group. conclusion: in brazilian patients, hsv-1 and ebv-1, rather than hcmv, were more frequently associated with cp and agp.

TI  == persistence of extracrevicular bacterial reservoirs after treatment of aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis persist in extracrevicular locations following scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotics, and antimicrobial rinses. methods: eighteen patients with aggressive periodontitis received a clinical examination during which samples of subgingival plaque and buccal epithelial cells were obtained. treatment consisted of full-mouth root planing, systemic antibiotics, and chlorhexidine rinses. clinical measurements and sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined the number of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola in the plaque. fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy determined the extent of intracellular invasion in epithelial cells. results: clinical measurements improved significantly following treatment. all bacterial species except p. gingivalis were significantly reduced in plaque between baseline and 3 months. however, all species showed a trend to repopulate  between 3 and 6 months. this increase was statistically significant for log t. denticola counts. all species were detected intracellularly. the percentage of cells infected intracellularly was not affected by therapy. conclusions: the 6-month increasing trend in the levels of plaque bacteria suggests that subgingival recolonization was occurring. because the presence of these species within epithelial cells was not altered after treatment, it is plausible that recolonization may occur from the oral mucosa. systemic antibiotics and topical chlorhexidine did not reduce the percentage of invaded epithelial cells. these data support the hypothesis that extracrevicular reservoirs of bacteria exist, which might contribute to recurrent or refractory disease in some patients.

AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of strict supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota in smokers and never-smokers. research into the impact of supragingival plaque control on the number of subgingival bacteria has resulted in contradictory findings. real-time  polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been suggested as a valid alternative to current microbiologic methods based on bacteria cultures. methods: forty-five subjects with chronic periodontitis were selected. twenty-four of them had never  smoked, and 21 were active smokers. four sites per patient were selected for sampling. supragingival debridement was performed at baseline, and the subjects received weekly instructions on oral hygiene for 180 days. a clinical examination and subgingival plaque sampling were carried out at baseline and at 30, 90, and 180 days. a real-time pcr assay was used to detect and quantify porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas  micros), dialister pneumosintes, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and the total bacteria load (eubacteria) in the subgingival samples. statistical analysis was performed using linear models adjusted for the clustering of observations within individuals. results: smokers and never-smokers exhibited a similar and significant reduction  in total bacteria counts over time. irrespective of smoking status, deep sites consistently harbored greater quantities of total bacteria throughout the study.  higher numbers of the bacteria investigated were associated with bleeding on probing. conclusion: supragingival plaque control markedly reduced subgingival microbiota counts in smokers and never-smokers.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == variability in the response of human dendritic cells stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background and objective: dendritic cells are able to prime and polarize naive t  cells towards either a t helper 1 or a t helper 2 response, depending on the antigen type and concentration, the costimulatory signals and the local cytokine  millieu. in this investigation, we analyzed the response of human dendritic cells to stimulation with different concentrations of porphyromonas gingivalis or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. material and methods: using different concentrations of p. gingivalis atcc33277 and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 33384, we determined the expression of the maturation markers cd80 and cd86 from  purified human dendritic cells by flow cytometry. we also evaluated the mrna expression levels for the cytokines interleukin-1beta, interleukin-2, interleukin-5, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interleukin-12, interleukin-13, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and tumor necrosis factor-beta by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. results:  both p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans led to dendritic cell maturation, but the expression of cd80 was higher when the dendritic cells were stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans. although both pathogens induced a t helper 1 pattern of cytokine expression, a. actinomycetemcomitans-stimulated dendritic cells expressed interleukin-1beta, interleukin-12, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and tumor necrosis factor-beta at lower bacterial concentrations than p. gingivalis. while 10(6) bacteria/ml of p. gingivalis or 10(4) bacteria/ml of a. actinomycetemcomitans induced expression of interleukin-12p40, the expression of other cytokines required 10 to 100-fold higher concentrations of bacteria. conclusion: these results demonstrate that a.  actinomycetemcomitans is a more potent immunogen than p. gingivalis because, at least in vitro, it induces stronger differentiation and activation of dendritic cells. in addition, our data also show that for a given strain, the bacterial load determines the pattern of cytokines that are expressed.

TI  == free soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappab ligand in gingival crevicular fluid correlates with distinct pathogens in periodontitis patients.
AB  == aim: the aim of the experiment was to investigate the levels of free soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb ligand (srankl) in periodontal health and disease and their correlations to clinical parameters and important periodontal pathogens. material and methods: chronic periodontitis (n=35) and periodontally healthy (n=38) subjects participated in the present study. pocket depth, recession and bleeding index were recorded at a total of 221 sites. subgingival plaque samples from these sites were analysed for the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. gingival crevicular fluid samples were analysed with elisa for levels of free srankl. comparisons between groups were performed by applying  non-parametric tests (mann-whitney) and correlations among parameters were sought for with spearman's r coefficient. results: mean levels of free srankl were higher in periodontitis subjects and correlated significantly with mean counts of t. denticola on the subject level and p. gingivalis, t. denticola on the site level (spearman's r coefficient, p<0.05), but not with clinical parameters. no correlations were found between the levels of free srankl and investigated parameters in periodontally healthy individuals. no effect of smoking was found on investigated parameters and correlations (univariate analysis of variance and  pairwise comparisons). conclusions: findings from the present study suggest a correlation of levels of srankl with important pathogens in periodontitis patients.

AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == comparison of culture methods and multiplex pcr for the detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in biofilm associated with severe forms of periodontitis.
AB  == conventional culture methods and multiplex pcr, both of which we have been used for a long time in our clinical microbiology laboratory, were compared for their  ability to detect a selected panel of periodontopathic bacteria: aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. tests were performed in a single subgingival sample taken from a periodontal diseased site with a probing depth equal to or greater than 6mm. the results were compared site-by-site, taking into account the quality and the presence or absence of pathogens. 529 samples of subgingival plaque were analysed and the prevalence of  the six species monitored varied in relation to the species itself and the method of detection. the most represented species is f. nucleatum, with a percentage of  positive variability between 44.9% pcr and 46.5% culture test. generally, the lowest prevalence was determined by culture test, with the exception of e. corrodens and f. nucleatum, which, unlike other bacteria, have been seen in higher percentages in culture with respect to pcr. for both methods, there was a  good degree of accuracy in the determination of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, and p. gingivalis. it becomes weak for f. nucleatum and p.  intermedia. both culture and pcr techniques introduced many methodological problems when applied in oral microbiology, but the ideal technique for accurate  detection of pathogens in subgingival plaque samples has yet to be developed.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == influence of the menstrual cycle on the oral microbial flora in women: a case-control study including men as control subjects.
AB  == changes in the levels of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle may cause cyclic differences in subgingival bacterial colonization patterns. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle cause changes in the oral microbiota. methods: bacterial plaque samples were collected in 20 systemically and periodontally healthy women using no hormonal contraceptives (test group) over a period of 6 weeks. twenty age-matched systemically and periodontally healthy men were assigned to the control group. samples were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay, and 74 species were analyzed. results: no cyclic pattern of bacterial colonization was identified for any of the 74 species studied in women not using  hormonal contraceptives. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (y4) was common at the beginning of menstruation (mean: 32%) and increased during the following 2 weeks (36%) in women (p <0.05). no cyclic differences in bacterial presence were found among the men (p values varied between 0.14 and 0.98). men presented with significantly higher bacterial counts for 40 of 74 species (p <0.001), including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.15) or  tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.42). conclusions: during a menstruation period, cyclic variation in the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy women of child-bearing age who were not using oral hormonal contraceptives could not be confirmed. male control subjects presented with higher levels of many species but also without a cyclic pattern.

TI  == moxifloxacin as an adjunctive antibiotic in the treatment of severe chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the impact of moxifloxacin (mox) was analyzed in the treatment of severe chronic periodontitis. methods: in a randomized, prospective, clinical multicenter trial, 92 subjects with severe chronic periodontitis were treated with scaling and root planing (srp) alone (control group; n = 21), srp plus adjunctive doxycycline (dox group; n = 36), or srp plus adjunctive mox (mox group; n = 35). probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment. the load of periodontopathogens, the level of interleukin-8, and the activities of granulocyte elastase and myeloperoxidase were also measured. results: all three procedures led to significant reductions in pd, cal, and bop. pd reduction was significantly greater (p <0.05) in the mox  group (2.46 +/- 1.17 mm at 6 months and 2.84 +/- 1.53 mm at 12 months) compared to the dox group (1.85 +/- 1.24 mm and 2.19 +/- 1.13 mm at 6 and 12 months, respectively) and the controls (1.77 +/- 0.57 mm and 1.86 +/- 0.56 mm at 6 and 12 months, respectively). only in the mox group was the load of all investigated bacteria and all inflammatory parameters reduced at each appointment compared to  baseline. conclusions: the adjunctive application of antibiotics improved the treatment outcome in subjects with severe chronic periodontitis. mox seemed to be more effective than dox and might be an alternative drug in the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == [state of local immunity in patients with chronic generalized parodontitis].
AB  == the aim of this work was the determination of the state of local immunity in periodontal complex in patients with chronic generalized periodontitis (cgp). 96  individuals were examined (mean age 43.6+/-1.2 years). all the patients were divided into 2 groups: basic group with cgp patients (76 persons) and comparative group - individuals with intact periodontium (20 persons). to evaluate local immunity in dentogingival fluids the determination of concentrations of igg, igm, and iga immunoglobulins has been used, as well as tnf-alpha, il-1, il-6, il-8, inf-gamma, il-1ra, il-10, and il-4 cytokines, and also factors controlling the state of bone tissue, namely, osteoprotegerine (opg), and rank-ligand. in gingival fluid of cgp patients the increase in both pro-, and anti-inflammatory mediators with indication to th2-deviation (decrease of inf-gamma level and elevation of il-4 level) was observed. cgp patients exhibited in their periodontal complex marked increase of igg, igm, and iga concentrations that apparently evidenced to the consequence of local polyclonal activation of b-lymphocytes. gingival fluid of cgp patients showed the elevation of rankl, tnf-alpha, and il-1 levels, and the decrease in opg concentration that could be the reason for osteoclast activation and subsequent destruction of bone tissue. in case of cgp in the zone of periodontium developed <<atypical>> inflammation that is characterized by elevated level of il-8 and predominance of neutrophil number over the quantity of other types of leukocytes.

TI  == two-year outcome with nobel direct implants: a retrospective radiographic and microbiologic study in 10 patients.
AB  == introduction: the nobel direct implant (nobel biocare ab, goteborg, sweden) was developed to minimize marginal bone resorption and to result in "soft tissue integration" for an optimized aesthetic outcome. however, conflicting results have been presented in the literature. the aim of this present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic outcomes of nobel direct implants. materials and methods: ten partially edentulous subjects without evidence of active periodontitis (mean age 55 years) received 12 nobel direct implants. implants were loaded with single crowns after a healing period of 3 to 6 months.  treatment outcomes were assessed at month 24. routine clinical assessments, intraoral radiographs, and microbiologic samplings were made. histologic analysis of one failing implant and chemical spectroscopy around three unused implants was performed. paired wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the evaluation of bone loss; otherwise, descriptive analysis was performed. results: implants were functionally loaded after 3 to 6 months. at 2 years, the mean bone loss of remaining implants was 2.0 mm (sd +/- 1.1 mm; range: 0.0-3.4 mm). three out of 12 implants with an early mean bone loss >3 mm were lost. the surviving implants showed increasing bone loss between 6 and 24 months (p = .028). only 3 out of the 12 implants were considered successful and showed bone loss of <1.7 mm after 2 years. high rates of pathogens, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and tanerella forsythia, were found. chemical spectroscopy revealed, despite the normal signals from ti, o, and c, also peaks of p, f, s, n, and ca. a normal histologic image of osseointegration was observed in the apical part of the retrieved implant. conclusion: radiographic evidence and 25% implant failures are indications of a low success rate. high counts and prevalence of significant pathogens were found at surviving implants. although extensive bone loss had occurred in the coronal part, the apical portion of the implant showed some bone  to implant integration.

TI  == expression of fcgammars and mcd14 on polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes  may determine periodontal infection.
AB  == variance in expression of receptors for immunoglobulin g (fcgammars), complement  (cr3) and lipopolysaccharide (mcd14) on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) and  monocytes might affect susceptibility for infection with certain pathogens in periodontitis, a chronic infectious disease of tooth-supportive tissues. levels of fcgammari, iia, iii, cr3 and mcd14 on pmns and monocytes were measured in 19 periodontitis patients and 18 healthy controls. subgingival infection with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) was  determined. activation of pmns and monocytes in response to stimulation with aa and pg was assessed by means of change in mcd14 expression. periodontitis is associated with an enrichment of the fcgammariii(+) monocytes (p = 0.015) with concomitant low mcd14 (p = 0.001). unadjusted data showed that the subjects culture-positive for aa (aa(+)) had significantly lower expression of monocytic fcgammari (p = 0.005) and fcgammariia (p = 0.015) than pg(+) subjects. the fcgammari was still lower on monocytes from aa(+) subjects after adjusting for the background factors (p = 0.037). pmns from aa(+) subjects responded in a hyper-reactive manner, in particular when stimulated with aa (p = 0.011). lower fcgammars expression by monocytes is related to a higher susceptibility of a subject to become infected with aa. the higher proportion of fcgammariii(+) monocytes may be involved in the chronicity of this condition. hyper-reactive pmns in aa(+) subjects may contribute to accelerated breakdown of tooth-supportive tissues.

TI  == targeted antimicrobial activity of a specific igg-smap28 conjugate against porphyromonas gingivalis in a mixed culture.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides coupled to a ligand, receptor or antibody for a specific pathogenic bacteria could be used to develop narrow-spectrum pharmaceuticals with 'targeted' antimicrobial activity void of adverse reactions often associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. to assess the feasibility of this approach, in this study sheep myeloid antimicrobial peptide (smap) 28 was linked  to affinity- and protein g-purified rabbit immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies specific to the outer surface of porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381. the selective activity of the p. gingivalis igg-smap28 conjugate was then assessed by adding it to an artificially generated microbial community containing p. gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and peptostreptococcus micros.  the specificity of the p. gingivalis igg-smap28 conjugate in this mixed culture was concentration-dependent. the conjugate at 50 microg protein/ml lacked specificity and killed p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. micros. the conjugate at 20 microg protein/ml was more specific and killed p. gingivalis. this is an initial step to develop a selective antimicrobial agent that can eliminate a specific periodontal pathogen, such as p. gingivalis, from patients with periodontal disease without harming the normal commensal flora.

TI  == prevalence and distribution of principal periodontal pathogens worldwide.
AB  == background: detailed genetic analysis of bacteria has demonstrated an unanticipated genetic diversity within species, which often reveals evolutionary  lineages that are disproportionately associated with infection. there is evidence that some evolutionary lineages of bacteria have adapted to particular ethnic groups. aim: this review analyzes to what extent observed differences in periodontal disease prevalence among ethnically or geographically distinct populations may be explained by restricted host adaptation of clones of principal periodontal pathogens. results: carriage rates of several putative periodontal pathogens and particular subsets of these species vary between ethnic groups. few of these differences can, with the limited information available, be directly related to differences in periodontal disease prevalence. asian populations are regularly colonized with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype c with questionable pathogenic potential. conversely, the jp2 clone of a. actinomycetemcomitans has enhanced virulence and causes significantly higher prevalence of aggressive periodontitis in adolescents whose descent can be traced back to the mediterranean and western parts of africa. some genetically distinct  types of porphyromonas gingivalis are more associated with disease than others, but additional work is required to relate this to clinical differences. conclusions: studies that take into account differences linked to the genetics of both patients and potential pathogens are likely to give better insight into the  aetiology of periodontal diseases.

TI  == doxycycline reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory mediator secretion in macrophage and ex vivo human whole blood models.
AB  == background: tetracyclines have been extensively used as adjuncts in the treatment of some forms of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of doxycycline to influence the secretion of inflammatory mediators in macrophage and ex vivo human whole blood models stimulated with periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharides (lps). methods: monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with various concentrations of doxycycline prior to being stimulated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) lps. the capacity of doxycycline to mediate the inflammatory response was also tested in an ex vivo whole blood model (whole  blood isolated from periodontitis patients and healthy subjects) stimulated with  porphyromonas gingivalis lps. the secretion of interleukin (il)-1beta, -6, and -8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in both models was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). changes in phosphorylation state of kinases induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans lps and doxycycline in the macrophage model were characterized by a multiplex elisa analysis. results: the secretion of il-1beta and -8 and tnf-alpha by macrophages decreased significantly (p <0.05) when they were pretreated with 2 microm doxycycline, whereas a concentration of 10 microm was required to significantly reduce il-6 secretion. pretreatment of macrophages with 10 microm doxycycline prior to a. actinomycetemcomitans lps stimulation resulted in a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) 1/2 (-76%). in the whole blood model, doxycycline,  more particularly at 10 microm, was also a potent inhibitor of the proinflammatory cytokine response. conclusion: these two models provided clear evidence that some of the clinically proven benefits of doxycycline may be related to its ability to regulate inflammatory mediator release by host cells.

TI  == a licorice extract reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion by macrophages and whole blood.
AB  == background: periodontal diseases are a group of inflammatory disorders initiated  by specific gram-negative periodontopathogenic bacteria that lead to the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. in this study, we tested whether a carbon dioxide-supercritical extract of glycyrrhiza uralensis (licorice) can reduce the periodontopathogen-induced inflammatory response. methods: monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with various concentrations of the licorice extract prior to being stimulated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (lps). the capacity of the licorice extract to mediate the inflammatory response was also tested in an ex vivo whole  blood model stimulated with p. gingivalis lps. the secretion of interleukin (il)-1beta, -6, and -8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in both models was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. changes in the phosphorylation state of macrophage intracellular kinases induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans lps and the licorice extract in the macrophage model were characterized by immunoblotting. results: the licorice extract exhibited potent anti-inflammatory properties, inhibiting the periodontopathogen lps-induced il-1beta, -6, and -8 and tnf-alpha responses of macrophages. the licorice extract inhibited the phosphorylation of important macrophage intracellular signaling proteins, including nuclear factor-kappa b p65 nuclear transcription factor and jun proto-oncogene-encoded activator protein (ap) 1 transcription factor, which are involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. the licorice extract was also a  potent inhibitor of the proinflammatory cytokine response in the ex vivo human whole blood model. conclusion: this co(2)-supercritical licorice extract is a potential candidate for the development of a new therapy to prevent and/or treat  periodontitis-associated tissue destruction.

TI  == distribution of systemic clarithromycin to gingiva.
AB  == background: aggressive and recurrent forms of periodontitis are associated with infections by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis. because these pathogens invade tissue, they are difficult to eliminate by root planing alone. the use of  systemic antibiotics in conjunction with root planing significantly enhances clinical and microbiologic treatment outcomes. although it is not widely prescribed by periodontists, clarithromycin is potentially useful because it is taken up by host cells and has favorable antimicrobial activity. methods: experimental gingivitis was induced in eight healthy subjects at one randomly selected maxillary posterior site. the contralateral maxillary site served as the healthy control. thereafter, subjects were administered six doses of clarithromycin, 500 mg, every 12 hours. blood was then drawn, and samples of gingiva were harvested from both sites. the samples were extracted, and clarithromycin content was analyzed by liquid chromatography. results: mean clarithromycin concentrations in healthy control and inflamed gingiva (2.4 and 3.0 microg/g, respectively) were significantly higher than in serum (0.5 microg/ml; p <0.05). clarithromycin levels at control and gingivitis sites were higher than serum by 5.7- and 7.0-fold, respectively (difference between sites was significant; p = 0.02). at control sites, a significant decrease in gingival  crevicular fluid flow rate was evident at the conclusion of the clarithromycin regimen (p = 0.018). conclusions: clarithromycin can attain higher levels in gingiva than serum and reach higher levels in inflamed gingiva than in healthy gingiva. its distribution profile seems to be suitable for the treatment of periodontitis. the reduction in crevicular fluid flow at control sites suggested  that clarithromycin may produce anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  == clinical and serologic markers of periodontal infection and chronic kidney disease.
AB  == background: chronic kidney disease and its concomitant sequelae represent a major public health problem. recent data suggest periodontal infection contributes to chronic kidney disease. methods: this united states population-based study of 4,053 adults > or =40 years of age investigated the association between chronic kidney disease and clinical measures and serologic markers of periodontal infection. chronic kidney disease was defined as moderate-to-severe reduction of  kidney function with glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 59 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) based on stages 3 and 4 of the kidney disease outcome quality initiative. chronic oral inflammatory burden was measured as 1) clinical periodontal infection categorized as no periodontal disease, periodontal disease (at least one tooth with > or =4 mm loss of attachment and bleeding on probing as an indicator of inflammation), or edentulism and 2) serum immunoglobulin g antibody response to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis. multiple logistic regression modeling quantified the association between chronic kidney disease and chronic inflammatory burden and other risk factors. results: nine percent of the study population had chronic kidney disease, 22% had high a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody titer, 24% had high p. gingivalis antibody titer, 9% had periodontal disease, and 17% were edentulous. after simultaneously adjusting for recognized risk factors, adults with a high a. actinomycetemcomitans titer were less likely  to have chronic kidney disease (adjusted odds ratio [or(adj)] = 0.67; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.46 to 0.98), and adults with edentulism were more likely to have chronic kidney disease (or(adj) = 1.64; 95% ci: 1.11 to 2.44). conclusion: these results support considering edentulism and low serum titer to a. actinomycetemcomitans as risk indicators for chronic kidney disease.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == background: real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been used to assist in  the detection and quantification of several periodontal pathogens. the aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of real-time pcr aimed at detecting aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: studies comparing real-time pcr versus anaerobic bacterial culture were identified via electronic and manual searches. meta-analyses examined the areas under summary receiver operator characteristic curves (srocs), and diagnostic odds ratios (dors) were calculated to evaluate the test accuracy. results: five studies met the inclusion criteria and showed some degree of heterogeneity. the areas under srocs for real-time pcr in identifying a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were 95.9% and 99.5%, respectively. the dors in detecting a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were 18.5 (95% confidence interval [ci]:  2.25 to 152.02) and 40.47 (95% ci: 1.99 to 822.26), respectively. conclusions: the present review showed a high diagnostic accuracy of real-time pcr in detecting a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis compared to the culture technique. however, the choice of the microbiologic test is determined by several factors, including diagnostic accuracy, cost, availability, and the need for an antibiotic susceptibility test.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of an essential-oil-containing mouth rinse applied in the "one-stage full-mouth disinfection" protocol--a randomized doubled-blinded preliminary study.
AB  == the aim of this randomized double-blinded preliminary study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological long-term effects of an essential-oil-containing mouth rinse as the active agent utilized in the "one-stage full-mouth disinfection protocol." probing pocket depth and plaque and gingival indices were evaluated by the same calibrated examiner in all teeth of 20 moderate chronic periodontitis subjects. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were determined by polymerase chain reaction in nonstimulated saliva, tongue dorsum, and pooled subgingival samples. the subjects were randomized into two groups: full-mouth disinfection plus essential oils (listerine) or full-mouth disinfection plus placebo. clinical and microbial parameters were evaluated at baseline (t0), 45 (t1) and 180 (t2) days after therapy and analyzed using analysis of variance, student t, and wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05). no significant differences were observed between groups regarding clinical measurements at baseline. however, in  the later examinations, t1 and t2, the test group always presented higher reductions of pocket depth, plaque index, and gingival index compared to the control group. the essential-oils group revealed significant reduction on occurrence of p. gingivalis in saliva comparing baseline and 45 days; this difference still remain at 180 days. the essential-oil-containing mouth rinse demonstrated beneficial effects on clinical parameters. microbiological findings  were less consistent. the results of this preliminary study suggest further investigations.

TI  == [study of adherence of periodontal pathogens to collagen-treated hydroxyapatite].
AB  == objective: the ability of oral bacteria to adhere to tooth surface is associated  with their pathogenicity. the objective of this study was to compare the ability  of 4 strains of periodontal pathogens attaching to collagen-treated hydroxyapatite (c-ha) beads in order to evaluate the ability of the main periodontal pathogens to form the biofilm on root surface. methods: the binding amount and binding percentage of 4 strains to c-ha were measured and compared by  3h-labeled binding assay. 4 strains of periodontal pathogens were fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) atcc 10953, porphyrin gingivalis (p. gingivalis) atcc 33277, prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) atcc 25611 and hemophilic actinomycetemcomitans (h. actinomycetemcomitans) atcc 29523. results: the differences of the percentage of relative adherence between f. nucleatum atcc 10953 and p. gingivalis atcc 33277, as well as between h. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29523 and p. intermedia atcc 25611 could not be observed. however, the percentage of relative adherence of f. nucleatum atcc 10953 and p. gingivalis atcc 33277 was higher than that of p. intermedia atcc 25611 and h. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29523 (p<0.001), no matter cultured 24 h or 48 h. no significant difference of the percentage of the relative adherence of each stain  between 24 h and 48 h cultured time could be found. conclusion: f. nucleatum and  p. gingivalis exhibited strong binding ability to c-ha. their adherence to root surface may play an important role in their local aggregation, biofilm formation  during the development and recurrence of the periodontitis.

TI  == disease severity associated with presence in subgingival plaque of porphyromonas  gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and tannerella forsythia, singly or in combination, as detected by nested multiplex pcr.
AB  == this study used a nested multiplex pcr method to detect three periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque collected before treatment and at 2 and 6 months  posttreatment from 107 patients with severe, generalized periodontitis. the proportions of the patients who harbored these bacteria before periodontal treatment were as follows: tannerella forsythia, 81%; porphyromonas gingivalis, 78%; and aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, 47%. at 2 months posttreatment there was a significant reduction in the numbers of patients harboring p. gingivalis (46%; p < 0.001) or t. forsythia (63%; p = 0.043) but not a. actinomycetemcomitans (50%) compared to pretreatment data. at 6 months posttreatment, significantly fewer patients harbored p. gingivalis (43%; p < 0.001); a. actinomycetemcomitans, (31%; p = 0.025), or t. forsythia (63%; p = 0.030). interestingly, at baseline and at 2 months posttherapy, subjects who harbored only a single pathogen had a greater level of periodontal disease than subjects who harbored two, or all three, of these periodontal pathogens. these data suggest that a reduction in the number of species present may be associated  with an increase in the severity of periodontal diseases.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == treatment outcomes of dental flossing in twins: molecular analysis of the interproximal microflora.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

TI  == periodontal debridement as a therapeutic approach for severe chronic periodontitis: a clinical, microbiological and immunological study.
AB  == aim: to clinically, microbiologically and immunologically characterize periodontal debridement as a therapeutic approach for severe chronic periodontitis. material and methods: twenty-five patients presenting at least eight teeth with a probing pocket depth (ppd) of >or=5 mm and bleeding on probing (bop) were selected and randomly assigned to quadrant-wise scaling and root planing or one session of full-mouth periodontal debridement. the following clinical outcomes were assessed: plaque index, bop, position of gingival margin,  relative attachment level (ral) and ppd. real-time pcr was used for quantitative  analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay permitted the detection of il-1beta, prostaglandin e(2), inf-gamma and il-10 in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). all the parameters were evaluated at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. results: both the groups had similar means of ppd reduction and attachment gain over time. besides a significant reduction in the bacterial level after treatment in both groups, microbiological analysis failed to demonstrate significant differences between them. finally, no difference was observed between groups with respect to the levels of inflammatory mediators in gcf. conclusion: periodontal debridement resulted in a similar clinical, microbiological and immunological outcome when compared with standard scaling and root planing and therefore may be a viable approach to deal with severe chronic periodontitis.

TI  == bacterial markers of periodontal diseases and their practical significance in dentistry.
AB  == the incidence and prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyronmonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis in specimens of subgingival dental deposit were evaluated in 495 residents of st. petersburg aged 6-82 years. the microorganisms were detected by gene-specific pcr of 16s rdna. in accordance with age-specific increase in the incidence of gingival diseases, the  percentage of samples containing t. forsythensis and p. gingivalis was significantly higher in adult and elderly patients in comparison with adolescents. the presence of t. forsythensis significantly correlated with the presence of gingivitis and dental deposit. in addition, the incidence of t. forsythensis was significantly higher in tobacco smokers. these results attest to a relationship between t. forsythensis infection and more frequent periodontal diseases associated with aging and tobacco smoking.

TI  == third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

TI  == clinical and laboratory evaluations of non-surgical periodontal treatment in subjects with diabetes mellitus.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory changes 3 months after full-mouth scaling and root planing in subjects with and without diabetes mellitus. methods: this study was performed using 10 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who required insulin therapy (dm) and 10 healthy adult control subjects (ndm) with generalized chronic periodontal disease. both groups were treated with full-mouth scaling and root planing and given oral hygiene instructions. clinical parameters, including plaque index (pi), gingival  index (gi), probing depth (pd), gingival recession (gr), and clinical attachment  level (cal), were measured at four sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from sites with the deepest pd (> or =5 mm) and with furcations in  each subject. samples were also tested for the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) by polymerase chain reaction. glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin [hba1c] and fasting glucose levels) and clinical and microbiologic assessments were recorded at baseline and 3 months after periodontal treatment. results: data revealed statistical changes (p < or =0.05; analysis of variance [anova]) in clinical variables (pi, gi, pd, gr, and cal) between baseline and 3 months in both groups. conversely, no improvement in the fasting glucose level or glycosylated hemoglobin (p < or =0.05; anova) was found after treatment. besides  some reduction in the bacterial frequency 3 months after treatment, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups. conclusion: clinical and laboratory responses were similar in dm and ndm groups 3 months after full-mouth scaling and root planing.

TI  == relationship of porphyromonas gingivalis with glycemic level in patients with type 2 diabetes following periodontal treatment.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum  glycemic levels and subgingival microbial profile alteration following periodontal treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. methods: we studied 30 periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received full-mouth subgingival debridement by analyzing their subgingival microbial profiles using a polymerase chain reaction method at baseline and various time-points for 12 months following treatment. concurrently, probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and metabolic parameters, including glycated hemoglobin a1c (hba1c), blood sugar level, c-reactive proteins, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, were recorded. results: periodontal conditions were significantly improved after treatment, and the occurrence rates of periodontal bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia, were also reduced. interestingly, p. gingivalis was detected more frequently in subjects with increased hba1c values after periodontal treatment than in those patients with decreased hba1c values. furthermore, p. gingivalis with type ii fimbriae was detected only in hba1c-increased subjects, while improvements in hba1c values were observed only in subjects without type ii clones. conclusions: these results suggest that glycemic level in diabetes is affected by the persistence of p. gingivalis, especially clones with type ii fimbriae, in periodontal pockets.

TI  == analysis of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid suggests importance of cathelicidin ll-37 in the innate immune response against periodontogenic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: during periodontitis, an innate immune response to bacterial challenge is primarily mediated by neutrophils. we compared neutrophilic content  and the level of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in two clinical forms of severe periodontitis. methods: gcf was collected from 14 patients with aggressive periodontitis, 17 patients with chronic periodontitis, and nine healthy subjects. samples were analyzed for periodontopathogen load using real-time polymerase chain reactions. the amounts of myeloperoxidase and alpha-defensins (hnp1-3) were determined by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay, and the level of cathelicidin (hcap18/ll-37) was assayed by  western blot. results: myeloperoxidase concentration was not correlated with levels of ll-37 and hnp1-3 in samples from patients, compared to controls. the amount of hnp1-3 was twofold and fourfold higher in patients with aggressive and  chronic periodontitis, respectively. those with chronic disease had significantly elevated amounts of mature ll-37. the increased concentration of both peptides in chronic periodontitis correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. conclusion: the lack of a correlation between ll-37, hnp1-3, and myeloperoxidase content suggests that neutrophils are not the sole source of these bactericidal peptides in the gcf of  patients with periodontitis; and that other cells contribute to their local production. the bacterial proteases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola might degrade hcap18/ll-37, because the 11-kda cathelicidin-derived fragment was present in gcf collected from pockets infected with these bacteria.  collectively, it appears that a local deficiency in ll-37 can be considered as a  supporting factor in the pathogenesis of severe cases of periodontitis.

TI  == rapid and simple detection of eight major periodontal pathogens by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.

TI  == an interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 3954 and red complex periodontopathogens independently and additively modulate the levels of il-1beta in diseased periodontal tissues.
AB  == inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a high individual variation in the levels of il-1beta mrna has been verified, which is possibly determined by genetic polymorphisms and/or by the presence of periodontopathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. in this study, we investigated the role of an il-1beta promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 3954 [il-1beta(3954) snp] and the presence of the periodontopathogens in the determination of the il-1beta levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis (cp) patients (n = 117) and control (c) subjects (n = 175) and the possible correlations with the clinical parameters of the disease. il-1beta(3954) snp was  investigated by restriction fragment length polymorphism, while the il-1beta levels and the presence of the periodontopathogens were determined by real-time pcr. similar frequencies of il-1beta(3954) snp were found in the c and cp groups, in spite of a trend toward a higher incidence of t alleles in the cp group. the il-1beta(3954) snp ct and tt genotypes, as well as p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola, were associated with higher il-1beta levels and with higher values of the clinical parameters of disease severity. concomitant analyses demonstrate that il-1beta(3954) and the red complex periodontopathogens were found to independently and additively modulate the levels of il-1beta in periodontal tissues. similarly, the concurrent presence of both factors was associated with increased scores of disease severity. il-1beta(3954) genotypes and red complex periodontopathogens, individually and additively, modulate the levels of il-1beta in the diseased tissues of nonsmoking cp patients and, consequently, are potentially involved in the determination of the disease outcome.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients on periodontal maintenance: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  == recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of pdt in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy  were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). the following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (fmps), full mouth bleeding score (fmbs), bleeding on probing (bop) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (rec), and clinical attachment level (cal). primary outcome variables were changes in ppd and cal. microbiological evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), tannerella forsythensis (t.f.), treponema denticola (t.d.), peptostreptococcus micros (p.m.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), campylobacter rectus (c.r.), eubacterium nodatum (e.n.), eikenella corrodens (e.c.), and capnocytophaga species (c.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. no differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of ppd, cal and fmps. at 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of bop was found in the test group. at 3 months  after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of f.n. and e.n. in the test group. at 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of e.c. and c.s. were detected in the test group. the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == background: the deleterious effects of the accumulation of supragingival plaque are well known, but the role of the proinflammatory property of supragingival plaque in periodontal diseases has not been completely elucidated. the aim of this study was to determine the relevance of toll-like receptor (tlr)2- and tlr4-stimulating activity of supragingival plaque to periodontal parameters. methods: we isolated 144 supragingival plaque samples and analyzed tlr2- and tlr4-stimulating activity using genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary reporter cells that express a reporter molecule upon activation of nuclear factor-kappa b through tlr2 or tlr4. the numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans cells in each plaque sample were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the activity to induce tlr4-mediated stimulation, but not tlr2-mediated stimulation, was positively associated with the plaque score and bleeding on probing score of the  teeth from which the plaque samples were taken. the activity to induce tlr2-mediated stimulation, but not tlr4-mediated stimulation, was negatively associated with probing depth and clinical attachment level. the ratio of tlr4-/tlr2-mediated stimulation was positively associated with all of those parameters. the number of p. gingivalis cells in each plaque sample was associated with the plaque score and clinical attachment level, but no strong association was observed between the ratio of examined bacteria in each plaque sample and the activity to induce tlr2- or tlr4-mediated stimulation, except for  a weak correlation between the ratio of a. actinomycetemcomitans cells and the activity to induce tlr4-mediated stimulation. conclusion: the tlr2- and tlr4-stimulating activity of supragingival plaque is associated with clinical parameters for gingivitis and periodontitis.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus in apical and marginal periodontitis: a role in pathology?
AB  == periodontitis is presumably caused by bacterial infection, but it has been shown  recently that affected tissue often contains human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) and epstein-barr virus (ebv). the present study was initiated to evaluate the role of these viruses in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. hcmv and ebv were quantified  in 40 apical and 25 marginal periodontitis samples using real time pcr. in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry was carried out on apical samples to detect viral presence within cells. a possible association with relevant bacteria was examined. of the apical periodontitis samples, 50% contained ebv, while none contained hcmv. of the marginal periodontitis samples, 40% were positive for ebv  and 12% for hcmv. with one exception, however, the amount of virus was close to the detection limits. ebv was only detected in 1 out of 15 healthy periodontium samples. immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were all negative. significant associations were found between periodontal ebv and the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. although there was an obvious association of the virus with clinical samples, it seems unlikely that these viruses play a major role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis of the average patient. their presence may reflect that the clinical samples contain more blood or saliva compared to controls, or an accumulation of lymphoid cells harboring virus in the inflamed tissue.

TI  == antibody levels to single bacteria or in combination evaluated against myocardial infarction.
AB  == background: evidence is accumulating that oral bacteria are associated with myocardial infarctions (mi). we were interested in studying the differences in the association between single bacteria or bacteria in combination and the relation to c-reactive protein (crp). material and methods: we examined the levels of antibodies against four major periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf) and treponema denticola (td) and crp in 548 men with a self-reported history of mi to 625 controls who took part in the oslo ii study in 2000. results: the mean levels of bacterial antibodies were higher for the cases than the controls,  but not significant as standard deviations were large. the level of crp was higher in the cases than the controls (p=0.010). logistic regression analyses comparing the upper quartile value with the lower value of one of either four antibodies (anti-aa, anti-tf, anti-td and anti-pg) were significantly associated  (p=0.032) with mi. equivalent analyses of either three bacteria showed significant associations for anti-aa, anti-td and anti-pg (p=0.036) and anti-aa,  anti-pg and anti-tf (p=0.040). crp showed an increased relative risk with increasing quartile value; trend, p=0.016, but not in multivariate analysis including the oral antigens. conclusions: no single bacterium but rather combinations were related to increasing relative risk for mi independent of known cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == lymphotoxin alpha lta+496c allele is a risk factor for periodontitis in patients  with coronary artery disease.
AB  == periodontitis and coronary artery disease (cad) are inflammatory diseases and associated with each other. the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) region carries genes involved in immune response and inflammation. we investigated whether the mhc genes correlate with the presence of periodontitis or with the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in patients with cad. blood and saliva samples from cad patients (n = 106) were collected at the time of hospitalization. nine mhc genetic markers [human leukocyte antigen (hla)-a, hla-b, hla-drb1, lymphotoxin alpha (lta) +253(a/g), +496(c/t), +633(c/g), +724(c/a), c4a and c4b)] were typed. based on panoramic tomography, patients were categorized into nonperiodontitis and periodontitis groups. two major periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, were cultivated and polymerase chain reaction-amplified from salivary samples. serum immunoglobulin (ig)a and igg antibody levels to these pathogens were measured. in the univariate analysis, lta+496c allele (or =  5.29; 95% ci = 2.07-13.51, p = 0.00027), and the occurrence of p. gingivalis in saliva (or = 4.74; 95% ci = 1.64-13.70; p = 0.002) were more frequent in periodontitis when compared with nonperiodontitis. similarly, serum iga antibody  level against the pathogen was increased in periodontitis (p = 0.048). in the multiple logistic regression analysis, when a wide range of covariates was included, the lta+496c allele (or = 10.87; 95% ci = 3.23-36.60; p = 0.00012) and  the elevated serum iga antibody level against p. gingivalis (or = 1.56; 95% ci =  1.05-2.30; p = 0.026) remained as significant risk factors for periodontitis. in  conclusion, the major finding of this study is that the lta+496c allele is associated with periodontitis in patients with cad.

TI  == [detection of periodontal pathogens in coronary atherosclerotic plaques].
AB  == objective: to explore the possible correlation between coronary heart disease and periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque samples and coronary atherosclerotic plaques were harvested from a total of 31 patients with periodontitis who scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery. the bacteria dna was obtained from  subgingival plaque samples and coronary atherosclerotic plaques using the chelex-100 method. the extracted dna was examined using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique. results: in coronary atherosclerotic plaques samples from the 31 patients, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg, 38.7%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa, 0%), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn, 22.6%), prevotella intermedia (pi, 12.9%), bacteroides forsythus (bf, 38.7%) were detected. the concordant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in subgingival plaques and in coronary atherosclerotic plaques in the same patient was pg 5 (16.1%), aa  0 (0%), pi 2 (6.5%), fn 4 (12.9%) and bf 8 (25.8%). conclusions: the presence of  periodontal bacteria dna in coronary atherosclerotic plaques could indicate that  periodontal pathogenic bacteria may play a role in the coronary heart disease process.

TI  == interleukin-6 polymorphisms are associated with pathogenic bacteria in subjects with periodontitis.
AB  == background: growing evidence suggests that individual genetic susceptibility may  influence the host's response to infections. previously, we showed that a common  variation in the interleukin (il)-6 gene was associated with increased odds of detection of common periodontal pathogens from individuals with aggressive periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between il-6 polymorphisms and periodontopathogenic bacteria in a larger, ethnically mixed population of subjects with periodontitis. methods: genomic dna was extracted from 107 subjects diagnosed with severe forms of periodontitis to study a cluster of polymorphisms in inflammatory genes, including il-6. the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) in their subgingival biofilm was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis. serum il-6 and c-reactive protein (crp) concentrations were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the il-6 -6106 polymorphism was associated with the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.009; odds ratio [or] = 3.5; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.38 to 9.16) and the concomitant detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis (p = 0.015; or = 3.6; 95% ci: 1.28 to 10.04). the il-6 -174 polymorphism was associated with increased odds of the concomitant detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis (p = 0.042; or = 2.8; 95% ci: 1.04 to 7.75). haplotype analysis of all five il-6 polymorphisms confirmed an association with the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.046). the il-6 -6106 polymorphism was also associated with crp serum levels at multivariate analysis (p = 0.024). conclusions: these findings confirm the hypothesis that complex interactions between the microbiota and host genome are at the basis of susceptibility to periodontitis. periodontal disease may represent a useful model to study the pathways and mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in inflammatory diseases.

TI  == microbiologic and immunologic characteristics of periodontal disease in hispanic  americans with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: the microbiology of periodontitis in type 1 diabetes has been reported, but less is known about type 2 diabetes. moreover, these data have not  linked microbial colonization, host response, and clinical presentation in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. the objectives of this study were to relate periodontal status, periodontal microorganisms, and host-response characteristics in hispanic americans with type 2 diabetes. methods: plaque and serum samples were obtained from 63 hispanic american subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. the microbiology of subgingival plaque samples was evaluated using dna checkerboard hybridization, and serum antibody to a battery of oral microorganisms was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: in general, similar pathogens were present in periodontitis sites from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, although the periodontitis sites in diabetes showed a higher frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and campylobacter spp. serum antibody to campylobacter rectus was elevated in type 2  diabetes, whereas antibody to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were elevated in subjects with periodontitis, irrespective of diabetes status. stratification of the population based upon antibody to p. gingivalis or c. rectus suggested a linkage between elevated antibody to p. gingivalis, increased frequency of diabetes, and significantly worse periodontitis. conclusion: the increased severity of periodontal disease with type 2 diabetes may reflect an alteration of the pathogenic potential of periodontal bacteria and/or a modification of the characteristics of the host's inflammatory response that may contribute to a breakdown in the homeostasis of the periodontium.

TI  == biofilms in the edentulous oral cavity.
AB  == purpose: the oral cavity presents numerous surfaces for microbial colonization. these surfaces produce biofilms of differing complexities unique to each individual. several studies have looked at biofilms in dentate patients. there has been limited research regarding biofilms on dentures or soft tissues of edentulous patients. the purpose of the present investigation was to provide meaningful data describing microbial ecological relationships in the oral cavity  of edentulous patients and to evaluate the microbiota on hard and soft tissue surfaces and saliva in edentulous patients wearing complete dentures. materials and methods: sixty-one edentulous subjects with complete maxillary and mandibular dentures were recruited. "supragingival" biofilm samples were taken from 28 denture teeth for each subject. biofilm samples were also taken from the dorsal,  lateral, and ventral surfaces of the tongue, floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, hard  palate, vestibule/lip, "attached gingiva," and saliva. samples were individually  analyzed for their content of 41 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. levels and proportions of each species were determined for every sample location. results: periodontal pathogens such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were clearly present in the samples from the edentulous subjects. microbial profiles in samples from the soft tissue surfaces differed among site locations. samples from the dorsum of the tongue exhibited the highest bacterial counts followed by the "attached gingiva"  and the lateral surfaces of the tongue, while the lowest mean counts were found in samples from the buccal mucosa and labial vestibules. using cluster analysis of the proportions of the test species, three clusters were formed. the first cluster comprised saliva, supragingival plaque, and the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue. the second cluster comprised the other six soft tissue surfaces. species on the denture palate formed a third cluster. conclusions: one  of the major findings in this study was the detection of periodontal pathogens, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, in the edentulous subjects, as these  species were thought to disappear after removal of all natural teeth. this finding has implications regarding future dental treatment and the general health of individuals. distinct patterns of microbial colonization were seen on the different soft tissue surfaces. thus, this investigation provided the first step  in defining the organisms that are associated with edentulous patients on both soft (mucosa) and hard surfaces (denture). the study also provided meaningful data that described microbial ecological relationships in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects. the authors believe that this study is the first comprehensive assessment of the microbiota in the complete denture-wearing subject.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of a composition containing lactoperoxidase on oral  bacteria and breath odor.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of a composition containing bovine lactoperoxidase (lpo), glucose oxidase, glucose and buffer salts was tested against oral bacteria in vitro. a preliminary in vivo study was conducted to test the effect on breath  odor of the tablets containing this composition. suspension of the composition in filter-sterilized saliva or phosphate-buffered saline containing sodium thiocyanate (nascn) at a physiological concentration showed bactericidal activity against aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. although hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) was not detected in the suspension, hypothiocyanite (oscn(-)) was detected at an average concentration of 0.161 mm. three tablets made with the composition were continuously sucked by three subjects, and the levels of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in their oral air samples were monitored over a 2 h period by compact gas chromatography. ingestion of the tablets reduced the average levels of vscs in the oral air, whereas non-treatment or ingestion of the control tablets without enzymes did not. these  results suggest that the composition shows bactericidal activity through the formation of oscn(-) in saliva and is effective for reducing breath odor, although further clinical studies are needed.

TI  == etiological analysis of initial colonization of periodontal pathogens in oral cavity.
AB  == it is unclear when the initial colonization by periodontal pathogens occurs in the oral cavity. therefore, we report here the association between specific age groups and the time when the initial colonization by periodontal pathogens occurs in the oral cavity in such groups. findings are based on an epidemiological analysis of the prevalence of five periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of  a wide range of age populations, from newborn to elderly, who were randomly selected in a geographic region of brazil. these periodontal pathogens include campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia and were analyzed in the bacterial samples isolated from gingival sulcus, the dorsum of the tongue, and cheek mucosa of diverse age groups, using a bacterial dna-specific pcr method. results indicated that there are distinct age-related groups where initial colonization by the five periodontal pathogens examined in this study can be detected and that the presence of teeth is a permissive factor  for colonization by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia. although it remains unclear exactly how or when target pathogens colonize healthy subjects, an understanding of age-related groups does provide a potentially useful tool in  the early detection and prevention of periodontitis in healthy individuals.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to examine whether serum immunoglobulin g (igg) levels to porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are higher in type 1 diabetic patients than in controls and are associated with coronary artery calcification, a measure of atherosclerosis.  material and methods: one-hundred and ninety nine type 1 diabetic patients (mean  age 38 +/- 4 years) and 201 age- and gender-matched nondiabetic subjects had coronary artery calcification, as measured by electron beam computed tomography.  serum igg levels to p. gingivalis w50 and to a. actinomycetemcomitans hk1651 whole cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: a similar proportion of diabetic patients (29%) and controls (31%, p = 0.7) had elevated serum igg to periodontal bacteria, defined as being above the median antibody level for both microorganisms. elevated antibody levels were associated  with higher systolic blood pressure (p = 0.02) and an increased odds of coronary  artery calcification in all subjects combined (odds ratio = 1.7, p = 0.047) and in diabetic subjects examined separately (odds ratio = 2.01, p = 0.027). association of serum igg levels with coronary artery calcification was independent of social class, lipids and antibody levels to other microorganisms,  but not systolic blood pressure (odds ratio = 1.4, p = 0.1 on adjustment for blood pressure). there was no association between serum igg level and vascular endothelial function. conclusion: elevated levels of serum igg to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans are associated with coronary artery atherosclerosis. this may reflect a direct role for periodontal infection or a role for the host response to infection in coronary atherosclerosis, particularly in patients with  type 1 diabetes.

TI  == the use of rodent models to investigate host-bacteria interactions related to periodontal diseases.
AB  == even though animal models have limitations, they are often superior to in vitro or clinical studies in addressing mechanistic questions and serve as an essential link between hypotheses and human patients. periodontal disease can be viewed as  a process that involves four major stages: bacterial colonization, invasion, induction of a destructive host response in connective tissue and a repair process that reduces the extent of tissue breakdown. animal studies should be evaluated in terms of their capacity to test specific hypotheses rather than their fidelity to all aspects of periodontal disease initiation and progression.  thus, each of the models described below can be adapted to test discrete components of these four major steps, but not all of them. this review describes  five different animal models that are appropriate for examining components of host-bacteria interactions that can lead to breakdown of hard and soft connective tissue or conditions that limit its repair as follows: the mouse calvarial model, murine oral gavage models with or without adoptive transfer of human lymphocytes, rat ligature model and rat aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans feeding model.

TI  == relationship between campylobacter rectus and periodontal status during pregnancy.
AB  == introduction: in a previous study, we showed that the growth of campylobacter rectus is stimulated by the presence of female sex hormones in the culture medium. in the present study, we examined the relationship between c. rectus levels in the saliva and the periodontal status of pregnant women. methods: unstimulated whole saliva was collected from 22 pregnant and 15 non-pregnant women. periodontal pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the concentrations of suspected periodontopathogenic bacteria in the saliva samples.  in addition, the concentration of estradiol in the saliva samples was measured by enzyme immunoassay. results: the average age, number of teeth, and total number of bacteria in the saliva of subjects in both groups were similar. the percentage of sites with a pd = 4 mm and the salivary estradiol concentrations were significantly higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. in addition, the percentage of bop sites and the c. rectus levels in the saliva of the pregnant women tended to be higher than in non-pregnant women, although these differences were not statistically significant. there were positive correlations  between c. rectus levels and estradiol concentrations, and between c. rectus levels and the percentage of sites with pd = 4 mm in the pregnant women. conclusion: these results indicate that c. rectus levels are higher in the oral flora of pregnant women and that this may be associated with increased salivary estradiol concentrations. this may contribute to periodontal disease progression  during pregnancy.

AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == assessing the levels of immunoglobulins in the saliva of diabetic individuals with periodontitis using checkerboard immunodetection.
AB  == background: current methods for determining salivary antibodies are cumbersome for large-scale screenings. objectives: to test checkerboard immunodetection for  monitoring salivary antibodies and to profile them in diabetic individuals with periodontitis. methods: salivary anti-porphyromonas gingivalis, anti-actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and total iga levels of 10 individuals  were compared using checkerboard immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results: close correlation between both methods was found in anti-p. gingivalis iga and total iga, but not in anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans iga, because of high background levels in elisa. thereafter, checkerboard immunodetection was used to compare salivary antibodies of 20 adult type ii diabetic with 32 non-diabetic individuals with (n=22) or without (n=10) periodontitis. patients with periodontitis (regardless of their diabetic condition) expressed increased levels of total iga in both whole and parotid saliva, but reduced levels of anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans iga in whole saliva.  consequently, the proportion of anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans iga in the total iga was lower in saliva of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy controls. conclusions: checkerboard immunodetection was reliable and economical for screening saliva samples for multiple antibody reactions. our results support previous reports which suggested that patients with periodontitis are able to secrete high levels of salivary ig, but are hampered in targeting their salivary  response toward a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == the inhibitory effects of naringin on the growth of periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == naringin is a flavonoid that is commonly found in grapefruits. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of naringin on the growth of periodontal pathogens such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis in vitro. for comparison, the effects of naringin on several oral microbes were also studied. different concentrations of naringin solution were added to calibrated suspensions of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis. all the suspensions were incubated for 3, 6 and 24 h in an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees c. at each time point, selected dilutions from each culture broth were plated on blood agar  plates. colonies recovered on blood agar were visually counted on days 3 and 5, respectively. a. actinomycetemcomitans showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in viable counts after 3 h when naringin was added at baseline. p. gingivalis also showed a marked growth reduction in the presence of naringin, and no colony  forming units could be observed after 24 h. naringin also had an inhibitory effect against all bacteria and yeasts tested. the results suggest that naringin  possesses significant antimicrobial properties on periodontal pathogens in vitro. it also has an inhibitory effect on some common oral microorganisms in low concentrations.

TI  == high incidence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans infection in acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == recent epidemiological studies suggest that periodontitis is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease (chd). the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between periodontitis and chd, particularly acute coronary syndrome (acs), focusing on microbiological and immunological features. twenty-eight chd patients, 15 with acs and 13 with chronic chd, were included in  this study. coronary angiography, periodontal examination, and dental radiography were performed in all patients. subgingival plaque, saliva, and blood samples were analyzed for the periodontopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia using polymerase chain reaction. specific serum antibody titers to the 5 periodontal pathogens were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. it was found that 33% of the acs patients (5/15) harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans in oral samples, whereas no a. actinomycetemcomitans (0/13) was found in the chronic chd patients (p < 0.05). furthermore, acs patients showed significantly higher serum igg titers to a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.05) compared with chronic chd. more tooth loss and alveolar bone loss were noted in acs patients than in chronic chd patients, although the differences were not statistically significant. periodontal pathogens, particularly a. actinomycetemcomitans, may play a role in the development of acs.

TI  == quantitative analysis of association between herpesviruses and bacterial pathogens in periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the development of human periodontitis may depend upon  cooperative interactions among herpesviruses, specific pathogenic bacteria and tissue-destructive inflammatory mediators. this study sought to identify associations among human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and six putative periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis lesions. material and methods: fifteen periodontitis patients (nine with aggressive periodontitis and six with chronic periodontitis) and 15 periodontally normal subjects were included in the study. in each study subject, a microbiological sample was collected, using a curette, from the deepest periodontal probing depth of the dentition. a real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction assay was employed to determine the subgingival counts  of human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus. statistical analysis was performed using the student's t-test, the pearson correlation coefficient test and the single variable logistic regression test for odds ratio-based risk calculation. results: human cytomegalovirus was detected in eight periodontitis lesions and in one normal periodontal site, epstein-barr virus was detected in nine periodontitis lesions and in two normal periodontal sites, and the study bacteria were detected in 6-15 periodontitis lesions and in  1-11 normal periodontal sites. correlations were found between counts of human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus, between counts of human cytomegalovirus and p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and c. rectus, and between counts of epstein-barr virus and p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr  virus counts were also positively associated with the level of periodontal attachment loss, probing pocket depth and gingival bleeding on probing. conclusion: this study confirmed that periodontal human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus are associated with major periodontopathic bacteria and with the severity of periodontal disease. the finding of abundant herpesviruses in periodontitis lesions redefines the pathogenic paradigm of the disease. understanding the interplay between herpesviruses and specific bacterial species  in the pathogenesis of periodontitis may form the basis for new approaches to preventing, reducing or delaying tissue breakdown from periodontal infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  == extracts or alkaloids isolated from mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. in this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a m. aquifolium  extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the m. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. the values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. the most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == ccl28 effects on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: chemokines are small proteins that signal to and attract cells of the immune system; they are vital components in the modulation of immunity and wound  healing. a newly described chemokine was reported to have antibacterial and antifungal activity. this chemokine, chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 28 (ccl28; also called mucosae-associated epithelial chemokine), is secreted by mucosal epithelial cells and is found in saliva and in breast milk. the objective of this study was to test whether ccl28 has antibacterial activity against two anaerobic  periodontal pathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. methods: we used a bacterial viability test, in which two  fluorescent dyes are bound differentially to living and killed bacteria. we tested the bacteria at concentrations of 2 x 10(7)/ml, exposing them to ccl28 at  concentrations from 0.04 to 10 microm. results: ccl28 was effective at killing both organisms. after 1 hour of exposure to the chemokine under appropriate oxygen conditions, the percentage of living organisms was reduced significantly for each species. we estimated the 50% effective concentration to be approximately 0.7 microm for p. gingivalis and approximately 2.0 microm for a. actinomycetemcomitans (n = five experiments each). we confirmed these observations using standard bacterial plating methods. conclusion: because this chemokine is secreted into the saliva, a reduction in salivary flow (as in xerostomia) may diminish the oral self-defense mechanisms by also reducing the exposure of bacteria to the antibacterial action of ccl28.

TI  == markers of systemic bacterial exposure in periodontal disease and cardiovascular  disease risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  == background: recent meta-analyses reported a weak association between periodontal  disease (pd) on clinical examination and cardiovascular disease (cvd). systemic bacterial exposure from periodontitis, which correlates poorly with the clinical  examination, has been proposed as the more biologically pertinent risk factor. the purpose of this study was to review and analyze the association between pd with elevated systemic bacterial exposure and cvd. methods: we searched in the pubmed, cochrane controlled trials register, embase, and scopus databases for all literature examining pd and cvd. from 10 selected publications, we extracted 12 cohort (n = 5) and cross-sectional (n = 7) studies and included 11 of these in a  meta-analysis. with stratified analyses, this resulted in 14 analyses of coronary heart disease (chd; n = 7), stroke (n = 4), and carotid intima-medial thickening  (cimt; n = 3) as a measure of early atherosclerosis. systemic bacterial exposure  was measured by periodontal bacterial burden (n = 1), periodontitis-specific serology (n = 12), or c-reactive protein (n = 1). results: periodontal disease with elevated markers of systemic bacterial exposure was associated strongly with chd compared to subjects without pd, with a summary odds ratio of 1.75 (95% confidence interval (ci): 1.32 to 2.34; p <0.001). this group was not associated  with cvd events or with stroke but was associated with a significant increase in  mean cimt (0.03 mm; 95% ci: 0.02 to 0.04). conclusion: periodontal disease with elevated bacterial exposure is associated with chd events and early atherogenesis (cimt), suggesting that the level of systemic bacterial exposure from periodontitis is the biologically pertinent exposure with regard to atherosclerotic risk.

TI  == n-acetylcysteine prevents lps-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and mmp2 production in gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == periodontitis is an inflammatory process that ultimately results in tooth loss. although the primary etiologic agent for periodontitis is bacteria, the majority  of periodontal tissue destruction is thought to be caused by an inappropriate host response. reactive oxygen species (ros) have been known to be involved in periodontal tissue destruction. we treated human gingival fibroblasts with lipopolysaccharide (lps) obtained from e. coli and the periodontopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, and examined their inflammatory responses in the presence and absence of the antioxidant n-acetylcysteine (nac). lps enhanced ros production, as well as, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and the production and activation  of mmp2. nac suppressed all lps-induced inflammatory responses examined, suggesting that lps-induced ros may play a major regulatory role in these responses in gingival fibroblasts. in addition, nac prevented lps-induced activation of p38 mapk and jnk but not phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of ikb. these results indicate that nac exerts anti-inflammatory effects in lps-stimulated gingival fibroblasts, functioning at least in part via down-regulation of jnk and p38 mapk activation. furthermore, this work suggests that antioxidants may be useful in adjunctive therapies that complement conventional periodontal treatments.

TI  == identification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis within human dental calculus: a pilot investigation.
AB  == objective: dental calculus is considered to be simply a "plaque-retentive factor", and therefore only a secondary aetiological factor in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. recent studies have suggested a more active role for calculus.  our objective was to demonstrate the presence of periodontal pathogens in the non-mineralised areas of supra- and subgingival dental calculus. methods: subjects for the study were derived from patients with substantial amounts of supragingival calculus in the lower anterior region who had moderate periodontal  disease, having been referred to the periodontal department at the eastman dental hospital for periodontal care. calculus was removed in as large pieces as possible by the use of a sickle or a push scaler placed underneath the apical or  facial border of the calculus and fracturing it from the tooth surface in a single stroke. the orientation and absence of dental plaque was confirmed using light microscopy for each sample prior to inclusion in this study. samples were prepared for transmission electron microscopic (tem) observation after immunogold staining with polyclonal antibodies for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. g.) and treponema denticola (t. d.). results: most of the samples contained at least one of the bacterial species examined, either in the lacunae or in the covering dental plaque. t. d. was the most frequently identified species and was found in nearly  all of the subgingival samples, whilsta. a. was rarely observed. conclusions: in  this limited study, supra- and subgingival dental calculus appears to be capable  of maintaining periodontal pathogens within the deep recesses of its structural lacunae and channels. therefore, calculus could possibly play a relevant role in  the aetiology and pathogenesis of periodontitis. the presence of t. d. in the majority of specimens requires further investigation as its pathogenic potential  may be underestimated in current published microbiological research, and further  work is required to determine its role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. however, further work by way of a large-scale definitive study is necessary to confirm the results of this investigation.

AB  == background and objective: periodontal disease is a chronic disease characterized  by the interaction between periodontopathic bacteria and the host immune response. the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between periodontopathic bacteria and host immune cell infiltrates. material and methods: twenty-two patients with chronic periodontitis were included in this study. gingival tissues were taken at the periodontal surgery after completion of initial therapy. three types of periodontopathic bacteria were detected by polymerase chain reaction, and the prevalence of mrna expression of chemokine receptors was examined by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the  gingival tissues. the infiltration of t and b cells was determined by an immunohistochemical method. results: in the patients, both porphyromonas gingivalis and tanerella forsythia were detected, and the mrna expression of chemokine receptors cxcr1&2, cxcr4, ccr1, ccr2, ccr3 and ccr4 were more prevalent. the mean number of infiltrated b cells was significantly larger than that of t cells in the sites harboring both p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. similarly, in the sites where p. gingivalis was detected but t. forsythia was not, the mean number of b cells was significantly larger than that of t cells. in the sites with mrna expression of ccr2 and ccr3, the mean number of b cells was significantly larger. conclusion: these results suggest that a high proportion of t helper 2-associated chemokine receptor-positive t cells may be associated with  the predominance of b cells and may play an important role in the formation of chronic periodontitis in sites where both p. gingivalis and t. forsythia are detected.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontally healthy children.
AB  == background: salivary occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria is of interest especially in children as a risk indicator for the transmission, development and  control of periodontal disease. we assessed the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola as microbial complexes  in the saliva of children with mixed dentition and healthy gingiva. materials and methods: paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 41 children (22 boys and 19 girls), aged 6-13 years old. gingival health was determined during the initial screening exam. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. results: p. nigrescens was the most frequent species (80%), followed by t. denticola (32%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (24%) and p. gingivalis (12%). p. intermedia and t. forsythia were not detected. p. nigrescens was also common species in combinations. paired and triple bacterial combinations were found in 24% and 20% of all children, respectively. there was no positive association between bacterial combinations in colonization and subject's gender (p>0.05, fisher exact test). conclusion: the salivary presence of p. nigrescens,  t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis but not p. intermedia and t. forsythia can occur in childhood without clinical signs of gingival disease. thus, the possible risk of bacterial transmissions through saliva and, the need to screen for periodontal pathogens should be considered before mixed dentition.

TI  == susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms  for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. material and methods: twenty strains  of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides ll-37 and human beta defensin-3. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. results: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to ll-37 than the others (p=0.004). the susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on  the species but not on the strains. the periodontopathic bacteria, especially actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003).  in addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. conclusion: our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some  periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == periodontal microbiota in patients with coronary artery disease measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction: a case-control study.
AB  == background: recent data have shown that periodontal disease may increase the risk of occurrence of coronary heart disease in which inflammation initiated by bacteria and their compounds might be a common causal factor. this case-control study aimed at studying the relationship between periodontal disease and coronary artery disease (cad) based on clinical and periodontal microbiologic parameters.  methods: a total of 90 male subjects, 48 to 80 years of age, were included in this study. forty-five men had cad (cad+), which was confirmed by coronary angiography. forty-five age-matched controls showed no history or symptoms of cad (cad-). all subjects underwent a clinical periodontal examination including assessment of tooth loss, probing depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding  on probing. in the cad+ group, this examination took place 1 day before coronary  angiography. subgingival microbial samples were taken and evaluated by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) for the total amount of bacteria and the following periodontopathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra (formerly micromonas micros), dialister pneumosintes, and campylobacter rectus. results: compared to control subjects, cad+ subjects had significantly deeper pockets (2.28 mm versus 2.96 mm; p <0.001) and greater attachment loss (2.85 mm versus 3.65 mm; p <0.001), and this difference remained statistically significant after  adjusting for smoking. no significant differences were observed between cases and controls with regard to the number of teeth present. p. intermedia was the only periodontal pathogen that showed significantly higher mean counts in cad+ subjects compared to cad- subjects. higher counts of total bacteria, p. micra, d. pneumosintes, and c. rectus were found in the cad- group. conclusion: the results suggest that a relationship between periodontal disease and coronary heart disease exists, although p. intermedia was the only periodontopathogen related to cad.

TI  == microbiologic analysis of periodontal pockets and carotid atheromatous plaques in advanced chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: in recent years, many researchers have focused their attention on the ability of periodontal pathogens to colonize atheromatous plaques. nevertheless,  a clear correlation between the detection rates of periodontopathic bacterial dna in atheromas and in subgingival plaque samples has not been established. the aim  of our study was to assess the presence of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia [formerly tannerella forsythensis]) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same patients. methods: thirty-three patients with advanced chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy were enrolled in the study. dna was extracted from subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas. universal bacteria primers for  general detection of bacteria and species-specific primers for detection of periodontal pathogens were used to amplify part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction. results: all subgingival plaque samples were positive  for at least one target microorganism. the prevalence of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 69.7%, 63.6%, 54.5%, 45.4%, and 33.3%, respectively. bacterial dna was detected in 31 out of 33 endarterectomy specimens. however, none of the samples tested positive  for dna from periodontal pathogens. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation; thus, no correlation could be drawn between periodontitis bacteria and microorganisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions.

TI  == stimulatory response of neutrophils from periodontitis patients with periodontal  pathogens.
AB  == objective: neutrophils play a crucial role in the defense of invading bacteria by releasing biologically active molecules. the response of peripheral blood neutrophils was studied in periodontitis-affected patients and in healthy controls towards stimulation to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans (aa) extracts. materials and methods: peripheral venous blood was drawn from 23 adult patients with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis (probing depth >or=5 mm, attachment loss >or=3 mm), and 30 healthy  volunteers. neutrophil response followed by metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) and interleukin-8 (il-8) secretion was assayed by zymography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, on both whole blood and purified neutrophils.  in addition to periodontal pathogen extracts, known stimulating agents were tested, such as escherichia coli-lipopolysaccharide (lps), phytohemagglutinin, and zymosan a. results: neutrophil response, expressed as a secretion ratio under stimulated and non-stimulated conditions, measured in whole blood, showed no differences between periodontitis and healthy controls. instead, in purified neutrophils from patients, mmp-9 exhibited a significantly higher secretion ratio with lps and pg (1.5- to 2-fold), whereas il-8 showed a larger increase in secretion ratio (3- to 7-fold) in the presence of pg, aa, lps, and zymosan a. conclusion: peripheral neutrophils of periodontitis-affected patients are more reactive as suggested by their significantly higher response toward periodontal pathogen extracts and other stimulating agents.

TI  == diagnosis and anti-infective therapy of periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal diseases (gingivitis and periodontitis) are chronic bacterial infections with a remarkably high prevalence and morbidity. periodontitis, in contrast to gingivitis, is not reversible, is associated with certain bacterial species and affects all of the soft tissue and bone that support teeth. among the periodontal pathogens, species, such as aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and several forms of uncultivable spirochetes play the major role in the pathogenesis. in severe chronic, recurrent and especially aggressive forms of periodontitis, diagnosis of the species involved and, whenever possible, an optimized evidence-based antimicrobial treatment is indicated. in order to monitor alarming bacterial changes in the periodontal pocket, several techniques, namely microscopy, culture, immunoassays, enzyme tests and dna-based techniques, have been established and the methods are described in the first part of this review. in the second part, the selection and use of locally delivered (topical) and systemic antibiotics used adjunctively in  periodontal therapy are discussed.

AB  == background: elevated levels of the macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (mip-1alpha) are reported in inflammatory bone diseases including periodontitis.  we evaluated the ability of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lpss) to modulate mip-1alpha expression in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns). we also evaluated the effect of mip-1alpha as an osteoclast activating factor. methods: human gingival  epithelial cells and fibroblasts were obtained by primary cell culture. pmns were isolated from healthy controls. human mg63 osteosarcoma cells were used as osteoblastic cells. after incubation of each cell type with il-1beta, porphyromonas gingivalis lps, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lps, mip-1alpha mrna and secreted protein levels were quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunohistochemistry. the ability of recombinant mip-1alpha to induce osteoclast  formation was determined by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase assay. results: mip-1alpha expression in pmns and gingival epithelial cells was induced by il-1beta and lps, but neither induced mip-1alpha expression in gingival fibroblasts or osteoblastic cells. mip-1alpha was highly expressed in the basal epithelial layer of inflamed gingiva but not in healthy gingiva. mip-1alpha induced osteoclast formation at an optimal concentration of 0.05 to 2 ng/ml. conclusions: mip-1alpha expression by gingival epithelial cells may be important  in initiating inflammation by facilitating accumulation and activation of leukocytes. the ability of mip-1alpha to facilitate formation of multinuclear bone cells indicates a possible role in periodontitis-associated bone destruction. these findings indicate mip-1alpha may play an important role in early and later stages of inflammatory-related periodontitis.

TI  == effects of glass ionomer and microfilled composite subgingival restorations on periodontal tissue and subgingival biofilm: a 6-month evaluation.
AB  == background: this 6-month study evaluated the effects of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (rmgi) and microfilled composite (mc) subgingival restorations on periodontal tissues and subgingival biofilm. methods: fifty-four  periodontally healthy patients were assigned as follows: group 1 (n = 18), root exposure (re) without non-carious cervical lesions (nccl) treated with coronally  positioned flap (cpf); group 2 (n = 18), re with nccl treated rmgi restorations plus cpf; group 3 (n = 18), re with nccl treated with mc restorations plus cpf. probing depth (pd), visible local plaque score (pl), and local bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed at baseline and 6 months after surgeries. restored and non-restored root recoverage (rr) was assessed at 6 months. each experimental tooth was subgingivally sampled (baseline and 6 months) and analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: clinical results showed no significant differences among the groups regarding pl, bop, and pd at baseline and 6 months. the rr means were similar among the groups at 6 months. intragroup  analyses revealed that the proportions of 10 periodontopathogens decreased at 6 months for the control group. for the rmgi group, there was a significant decrease in the proportions of nine periodontopathogens. for the mc group, there  was a significant increase in the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum and gemella morbillorum and a decrease in five periodontopathogens. intergroup analyses showed an increase in the proportion of f. nucleatum polymorphum for the mc group. conclusions: in a 6-month evaluation, well-finished rmgi or mc subgingival restorations did not negatively affect periodontal health. furthermore, rmgi seems to exert more positive effects on the subgingival biofilm composition than mc.

TI  == age-dependent deficiency in saliva and salivary antibodies secretion in down's syndrome.
AB  == objective: down's syndrome (ds) individuals suffer from an increased susceptibility to infections. here, we assessed age-related changes in the salivary-specific humoral immunity of ds subjects. design: parotid and whole saliva were collected from a young group of ds (yds, n=30, 23.3+/-4 years), an older group of ds individuals (ods, n=10, 51.9+/-8 years) and compared to two age-matched groups of healthy volunteers--a young group (yc, n=29, 22.8+/-5 years) and an older group (oc, n=10, 48.4+/-9 years). the levels of total iga, and specific antibodies to three common oral pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans)  were analysed. results: the limited increases in iga concentrations could not compensate the dramatic reduction in the salivary flow rate observed in ds individuals. therefore, the median secretion rates of the specific antibodies in  whole and parotid saliva were 70-77% and 34-60% (respectively) lower in yds individuals as compared to yc and farther 77-100% and 75-88% (respectively) lower in ods compared to yds. in contrast, the antibody secretion rates were similar for parotid saliva, or even increased for whole saliva of oc, compared with yc. consequently, a dramatic cumulative extreme reduction (>92%) in the bacterial specific salivary antibodies differentiated the adult ds individuals from to their age-matched controls. conclusions: our results indicate a severe immunodeficiency in the secretion rate of the specific salivary iga response of in ds individuals which intensifies with age.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in erupting third molars of periodontally healthy subjects.
AB  == the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythensis in bacteriologic samples of 5-7-mm deep mandibular third-molar pericoronal pockets was analysed by polymerase chain reaction, to test the hypothesis that these sites would harbour the bacteria. the patients were periodontally healthy 20-year-old finnish male conscripts. sixteen had acute pericoronitis, 28 chronic pericoronitis, and 15 were symptom-free controls. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only 7% of the samples from chronic pericoronitis cases, whereas p. gingivalis was positive  in 20% of the symptom-free versus 69% (p = 0.018) of the acute and 57% (p = 0.044) of the chronic cases. the percentages for p. intermedia were 93, 94 and 93%, and for t. forsythensis 47, 63 and 57%, respectively. these results confirm  that, apart from a. actinomycetemcomitans, periodontopathogens are common in third-molar sites in periodontally healthy individuals.

AB  == aims: the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the systemic administration of metronidazole and amoxicillin as an adjunct to initial periodontal therapy in patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis. methods and materials: this randomized, double blind, placebo controlled parallel study involved 50 adult patients with untreated periodontitis who were randomly assigned to receive either a full-mouth scaling and root planing along with systemic metronidazole and amoxicillin (t group) or scaling and root planing with a placebo (p group). clinical measurements including probing depth (pd), clinical attachment levels (cal), plaque index (pi), and bleeding index (bi) were recorded at baseline and six to eight weeks after therapy. the deepest pocket was selected and samples for microbiological testing were taken. patients received coded study medications of either 500 mg amoxicillin in combination with 250 mg metronidazole or an identical placebo every eight hours for seven days following scaling and root planing. results: there was a significant change in pd (p=0.0001), cal (p=0.00001), pi (p<0.05), and bi (p<0.05) in the t group compared to the placebo  group after therapy. parallel to the clinical changes, treatment significantly reduced the number of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and p. intermedia (pi) compared with baseline in the t group (p=0.003, 0.021 and 0.0001, respectively). however, in the p group only the pi colony count was reduced significantly (p=0.0001). after therapy, there was a significant difference between the t and p groups in the number of patients negative for aa, pg, and pi (pv = 0.033). conclusions: the significant differences between treatment and placebo groups are in line with other studies and support the considerable adjunctive benefits of the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == interleukin- 1 gene polymorphisms as assessed in a 10-year study of patients with early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == our 10-year study of early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients includes repeated clinical observations, microbiological characteristics and analysis of genetic polymorphism of il-1a and il-1b genes. twenty patients (age 15-26 years) were divided according to the clinical status in the 4th year into a group with mean number of teeth with bleeding on probing (bp) 9.8 and mean number of teeth with periodontal pocket (pp) 2.23, and a group with mean number of teeth with bp 5.37  and no pp. significantly higher values of mean bp and pp were found among the groups during the study but a strong progression of disease was found only in 3 patients. the risk il-1a allele-2 and il-1b allele-2 genotype and bacterial presence were analyzed by dna hybridization methods. no significant differences of bacteria composition (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were found between the groups. a higher prevalence of composite il-1 genotype was detected in the group of eop patients with progressive disease. early finding of the disease followed by conservative therapy could positively influence the disease progression. eop treated in early  stages may, but need not, develop into the aggressive form in the presence of risk genotype il-1.

TI  == population-based study of salivary carriage of periodontal pathogens in adults.
AB  == large, general population-based data on carriage rates of periodontal pathogens hardly exist in the current literature. the objectives of the present study were  to examine the salivary detection of aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola in a representative  sample of the adult population living in southern finland and to clarify which determinants are associated with the presence of these pathogens in saliva. 16s rrna-based pcr methods with species-specific primers were employed to determine the presence of the six target bacteria in stimulated saliva samples, which were  available from 1,294 subjects aged > or =30 years. the age group, gender, level of education, marital status, smoking history, number of teeth, and number of teeth with deepened pockets were included in the statistical analysis. in general, the carriage of periodontal pathogens was common, since at least one of  the examined pathogens was found in 88.2% of the subjects. in descending order, the total detection rates were 56.9%, 38.2%, 35.4%, 31.3%, 20.0%, and 13.9% for t. forsythensis, t. denticola, p. gingivalis, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, respectively. age per se was strongly associated with the carriage of p. gingivalis (p = 0.000), and the level of education with that of t. denticola (p = 0.000). there was an association between the number of teeth with deepened pockets and carriage of p. gingivalis (p = 0.000), p. intermedia (p = 0.000), t. denticola (p = 0.000), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.004). the data suggest that distinct species have a  different carriage profile, depending on variables such as age, educational level, and periodontal status.

AB  == the paper describes an optimized technique for dna isolation from the streptococcus mutans cultures and from the clinical samples including proteinase  k treatment and detergent lysis, followed by sorbent-based enrichment. this technique was employed for isolating dna from the periodontal bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and bacteroides forsythus. a multiplex pcr technique was adapted for large-scale studies of clinical samples. an original pcr method was developed for the semiquantitative detection of str. mutans, showing the sensitivity of 100 genome copies per reaction. extensive studies of approximately 2,000 individuals have demonstrated  that these methods are applicable to the study of the dental and gingival microflora in the biological sample from the oral cavity of persons with dental diseases from various age groups.

AB  == aim: to evaluate and compare the microbiological effects of hand instruments, er:yag-laser, sonic, and ultrasonic scalers in patients with chronic periodontitis. patient perception of each treatment was documented. material and  methods: from 72 patients, bacterial samples were collected from the deepest pocket in each quadrant (total: 288 sites). a polymerase chain reaction kit estimated the amount of aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythensis (tf), and treponema denticola (td) at baseline as well as 3 and 6 months after therapy. one quadrant in each patient was randomly assigned to curettes (h-group), er:yag laser (l-group), sonic device (s-group), or ultrasonic device (u-group). results: three months post-operatively, the amounts of pg, pi,  tf, and td were significantly reduced in all groups. laser and sonic instrumentation failed to reduce aa. six months after therapy, significant differences were still detected for pg (l- and u-group), for pi and tf (s-group), and for td (l-, s- and u-group). patients rated ultrasonic treatment as more preferable than hand and laser instrumentation. conclusion: the various treatment methods resulted in a comparable reduction of the evaluated periodontal pathogens, and bacterial increase was only partially different 6 months post-operatively. ultrasonic instrumentation caused less discomfort.

TI  == influence of sampling strategy on microbiologic results before and after periodontal treatment.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to test whether different sampling strategies would influence the microbiologic outcomes by assessing the bacterial  load and composition of the subgingival microbiota by means of anaerobic culturing before and after periodontal treatment. methods: the first study (1 versus 4 [1vs4]) included 33 patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. two sampling strategies were compared, sampling one site from the deepest pocket in the mouth (m1) versus a pooled sample of four sites from the deepest pockets in each quadrant (m4). the second study (2 versus 4 [2vs4]) included 20 patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. the strategy m4 was compared to a pooled  sample of two non-adjacent sites in the same quadrant (m2). all samples were processed identically by means of anaerobic culturing. in both studies, a pretreatment sampling was taken. however, in the second study (2vs4), subgingival samples were also taken at 1, 3, and 6 months after periodontal therapy. quantitative data were compared between strategies by means of t test and signed-rank test; qualitative data were compared by means of 2 x 2 contingency tables. results: pretreatment samples showed that total anaerobic counts were significantly higher for m4 compared to m1 (p <0.001) and m2 (p = 0.025). however, there were no significant differences in regard to percentage of microbiota and counts for each pathogen. most of the qualitative differences between strategies were caused by false negatives in m1 and m2. post-treatment samples showed a reduction in total counts and a limited impact in the frequency  of detection of periodontal pathogens. m2 detected a significant decrease in the  frequency of detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, which was not confirmed by the m4 strategy. conclusion: the criteria of selection and the number of sites selected when sampling the subgingival biofilm in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis may influence the detection and quantitation of periodontal pathogens when evaluated by culture especially after treatment.

TI  == rankl upregulation associated with periodontitis and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background: receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) ligand (rankl) and osteoprotegerin (opg) are critical for homeostatic control of osteoclast activity, suggesting their vital roles in the progression of bone loss in periodontitis. in this study, the expression of rankl and opg mrna and the relationship between these factors and periodontopathic bacteria in periodontal tissue were studied. methods: gingival tissue and subgingival plaque samples were collected from 15 patients with chronic periodontitis and 15 periodontally healthy subjects. rna was extracted from the tissue and subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) using primers specific for rankl or opg. beta-actin was amplified as a control to ensure equal loading. the intensity of rt-pcr products was analyzed by a densitometer in proportion to the  intensity of beta-actin. the numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were determined by quantitative real-time pcr. results: our results showed increased levels of rankl mrna in chronic periodontitis tissues. the rankl/opg expression ratio was significantly higher in the periodontitis group compared to the healthy control group (p = 0.001). interestingly, the expression of rankl (r = 0.64; p <0.001), but not opg (r = -0.24; p = 0.20), was significantly correlated with increased numbers of p. gingivalis. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only 6.7% of all sites. conclusions: chronic periodontitis was associated with rankl mrna upregulation and increased rankl/opg mrna expression ratio. in addition, our data showed for the first time to our knowledge an association between upregulated rankl levels and the number of p. gingivalis in clinically obtained periodontal tissues.

TI  == identification of periodontopathic bacteria in gingival tissue of japanese periodontitis patients.
AB  == introduction: the identification of invading periodontopathic bacteria in tissues is important to determine their role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.  the objective of this study was to identify periodontopathic bacteria in diseased gingival tissue of periodontitis patients. methods: subgingival plaque and gingival tissue were collected from 32 generalized chronic periodontitis (cp), 16 generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and eight localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) patients. detection frequencies and quantities of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythensis were investigated by polymerase chain reaction. the prevalences of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sobrinus were also examined and the distribution of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes was observed. results: p. gingivalis and t. forsythensis were detected in approximately 70% of tissue samples and 50% of plaque samples in the three periodontitis groups. prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in tissue samples was higher in the lagp (63%) group  than in either the cp (16%) or the gagp (38%) group. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype c was detected in 50% of lagp patients. detection frequencies of s. oralis and s. sobrinus were markedly low in both plaque and tissue samples from all three periodontitis groups. amounts of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythensis in the tissue samples were not different among the three periodontitis groups. conclusion: p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythensis can localize in diseased gingival tissue and may be involved in periodontal tissue destruction. serotype c is the predominant serotype of a. actinomycetemcomitans in japanese lagp patients.

TI  == activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by gram-negative periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease associated with a  gram-negative subgingival microflora. bacterial components stimulate, among other receptors, toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and/or tlr4. accumulating evidence indicates that both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses result from the triggering of tlr2 as compared to tlr4 triggering. the aim was to study the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum and veillonella parvula with tlr2 and tlr4. we investigated all known serotypes (k(-), k1-k6) of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a-e strains for their potency to stimulate cytokine production. methods: human embryonic kidney (hek) cells, stably transfected with cd14, cd14-tlr2, or cd14-tlr4 and whole blood were stimulated with bacterial sonicates. cytokine production (interleukin-6, -8, -10 and -12) was measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all test bacteria stimulated hek-cd14-tlr2, but only a. actinomycetemcomitans and v. parvula stimulated hek-cd14-tlr4. no differences were found in the activation  of hek-cd14-tlr2/4, or cytokine production in whole blood between serotypes of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: gram-negative periodontal bacteria predominantly stimulated tlr2, which may be of importance for the th1/th2 cell orientation of the immune response in periodontitis.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial synergy in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis.
AB  == purpose of review: periodontitis is an infectious disease, but the specific mechanisms by which tooth-supportive tissues are lost remain obscure. this article proposes an infectious disease model for periodontitis in which herpesviral-bacterial interactions assume a major etiopathogenic role. recent findings: epstein-barr virus type 1, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses occur at a high frequency in aggressive periodontitis lesions. also, herpesvirus-infected periodontitis lesions tend to harbor elevated levels of classic periodontopathic bacteria, including porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister  pneumosintes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans. summary: conceivably, a herpesvirus active infection in the periodontium impairs  local defenses, thereby permitting overgrowth and increased aggressiveness of periodontopathic bacteria. in turn, periodontal pathogenic bacteria may augment the virulence of periodontal herpesviruses. it is suggested that interactions among herpesviruses and specific bacterial species constitute an important pathogenetic feature of periodontitis and maybe also of various non-oral infections.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromatous plaques.
AB  == aim: in the last years the relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular  diseases has been a subject of increasing research. the identification of periodontopathic bacteria in atheromas can contribute to our knowledge of such an association. the aim of our study was to assess the concomitant presence of 5 periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same individuals. methods: twenty-one patients with chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy for carotid stenosis were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas were examined using the polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization techniques by means of specific probes for periodontal bacteria. human beta-globin amplification was used as internal polymerase chain reaction efficiency control. results: three patients were excluded because the endarterectomy specimens were negative to dna  amplification. all subgingival plaque samples were positive for at least one target micro-organism. the prevalence of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 72.22%, 61.11%, 55.56%, 50%, and 33.33%, respectively.  no periodontal bacteria dna was detected in any endarterectomy specimen. conclusions: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation and, thus, no correlation between periodontitis bacteria and micro-organisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions could be drawn.

TI  == gene polymorphisms and the prevalence of key periodontal pathogens.
AB  == growing evidence suggests that individual genetic susceptibility may influence the host's response to infections. the aim of this project was to study whether gene polymorphisms of inflammatory markers are associated with the presence of viable periodontopathogenic bacteria. we extracted genomic dna from 45 young adults diagnosed with generalized aggressive periodontitis to study fc receptors, formyl peptide receptor, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and vitamin  d receptor polymorphisms. the presence and viable numbers of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were determined by culture, and their identities confirmed by pcr. multiple logistic regressions revealed that both fcgamma receptor and il-6 -174 polymorphisms were  associated with increased odds of detecting a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis after adjustment for age, ethnicity, smoking, and periodontitis extent. these findings support the hypothesis that complex interactions between the microbiota and host genome may be at the basis of susceptibility to aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as indicator for aggressive periodontitis by two analysing strategies.
AB  == objective: to compare the subgingival microbiota of aggressive and chronic periodontitis (chp) using single-site and pooled plaque samples. methods: in 60 patients with aggressive or chp, subgingival plaque was sampled from the four deepest pockets using two sterile paper points simultaneously. one paper point from each pocket was put in a separate transport vial, the second was pooled with the three other paper points of a respective patient. the content of each vial was analysed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola. results: pooled plaque samples detected higher numbers for all tested pathogens than single-site samples. detection frequencies were similar for both strategies. using single-site samples, a. actinomycetemcomitans detection rate was statistically significantly  a higher in aggressive than in chp (p=0.01). a. actinomycetemcomitans was found in higher numbers, the other pathogens in lower numbers in aggressive than in chp. neither presence nor absence of one of the tested bacteria had sufficient positive or negative predictive value for aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in higher numbers and frequency in aggressive than in chp. its detection may confirm the clinical diagnosis and influence therapy. as a diagnostic test, its sensitivity and predictive value was low.

TI  == endotoxemia, immune response to periodontal pathogens, and systemic inflammation  associate with incident cardiovascular disease events.
AB  == objective: in periodontitis, overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria may cause endotoxemia and systemic inflammation leading to cardiovascular diseases (cvd). we investigated in a prospective study the associations of serum endotoxin, antibodies to periodontal pathogens, and inflammation markers with the risk of incident cvd. methods and results: the finrisk 1992 cohort of 6051 individuals was followed up for 10 years. we examined 185 incident cvd events and a control cohort of 320 individuals using a prospective case-cohort design. high antibody response to periodontal pathogens independently predicted incident cvd events with hazard ratios (hr, quartile 4 versus quartiles 1 to 3, 95% ci) of 1.87 (1.13 to 3.08). the subjects with a high antibody response and high crp or interleukin  (il)-6 had multivariate-adjusted hrs of 3.01 (1.27 to 7.09) and 3.11 (1.42 to 6.83) compared with low-responders, respectively. the corresponding hrs for high  endotoxin concentration were 1.82 (1.22 to 2.73, alone), 3.92 (1.99 to 7.74, with crp), 3.54 (1.78 to 7.03, with il-6), and 2.26 (1.13 to 4.52, with tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha) after adjusting for age and gender. these associations were abolished after adjusting for serum lipids. high endotoxin/hdl ratio, however, had a multivariate-adjusted hr of 1.92 (1.19 to 3.08) for cvd events. conclusions: our results suggest that the exposure to periodontal pathogens or endotoxin induces systemic inflammation leading to increased risk for cvd.

TI  == the effects of porphyromonas gingivalis lps and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lps on human dendritic cells in vitro, and in a mouse model in vivo.
AB  == interaction between different bacterial plaque pathogens and dendritic cells may  induce different types of t helper (th) cell response, which is critical in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. in this study we investigated the effects of lipopolysaccharide (lps) from porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-dcs) with respect to co-stimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production and th cell differentiation. unlike escherichia coli and a. actinomycetemcomitans lps, p. gingivalis lps induced only low levels of cd40, cd80, hla-dr and cd83 expression  on mo-dcs. lps from both bacteria induced considerably lower tnf-alpha and il-10  than did e. coli lps. lps from all three bacteria induced only negligible il-12 production. in a human mixed-leukocyte reaction, and in an ovalbumin-specific t cell response assay in mice, both types of lps suppressed ifn-gamma production. in conclusion, stimulation by p. gingivalis lps and a. actinomycetemcomitans lps  appears to bias mo-dcs towards th2 production.

TI  == the detection of eight putative periodontal pathogens in adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients: an institutional study.
AB  == purpose: periodontal disease is a commonly prevalent problem faced alike by both  the developed and third world countries but showing wide variations in prevalence and severity across different geographical areas. the purpose was to identify actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), ekinella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), bacteroides forsythus (bf), treponema denticola (td) and fusobacterium nucleatum  (fn) in indian adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients. materials and methods: paper points were used to collect the sample from 28 sites in both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis (8 healthy/20 diseased sites) patients and dna analysis done. the categorical data was analysed by fishers exact test and difference in the clinical parameters was tested by mann-whitney test. results: in healthy sites of adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients, aa, ec, bf and aa, pg, pi, td, fn were detected respectively. however, when diseased and healthy sites were compared in  both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients respectively, only pg( p =0.004), cr( p =0.04), fn( p =0.014) and pg( p =0.002),  cr( p =0.02), fn( p =0.008) were statistically significant. conclusion: the prevalence of the microorganisms correlate with the clinical parameters like probing depth and bleeding on probing as seen in the japanese and western periodontitis patients' population.

TI  == subgingival chlorhexidine varnish administration as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological observations.
AB  == background: recently, the clinical additive value of a highly concentrated chlorhexidine (chx) varnish, when applied subgingivally as an adjunct to scaling  and root planing, was described. the objective of the present study was to investigate the microbiological impact of a treatment strategy for chronic periodontitis based on a combination of same-day full-mouth root planing and subgingival chx varnish administration. methods: a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel trial was conducted on 33 non-smoking chronic periodontitis patients. the control group received oral hygiene instructions and  same-day full-mouth root planing. the test group received the same instructions and treatment; however, all pockets also were disinfected using a supersaturated  chx varnish. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the deepest site per  quadrant in each patient at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. pooled sample  analysis was performed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method for the identification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola  (td), and prevotella intermedia (pi). results: in terms of detection frequency and bacterial levels, significant, mainly temporary, reductions from baseline were found in both groups. when a comparison was made between the control and the test group, significant differences in the detection frequency of tf (p = 0.024)  and td (p = 0.024), which favored the test group, were found at 1 month. a similar phenomenon was seen for td (p = 0.031) based on bacterial levels. an important trend toward lower tf levels in the test group also was found at 1 month (p = 0.052). compared to baseline levels, microbiological benefits in the test group seemed to be maintained, at least in part, over a 6-month period. in contrast, all microbial levels had relapsed in the control group at study termination. conclusion: the microbiological results of the present study promote the subgingival administration of a highly concentrated chx varnish as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing.

TI  == [production of interleukin-11 and interleukin-6 in cultured human gingival fibroblasts with the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides].
AB  == objective: to observe the effects of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), escherichia coli (ec) lipopolysaccharides (lps) on the production of il-11 and il-6 from healthy human  gingival fibroblasts (hgf), and the effects of endogenous prostaglandin on hgf il-11 and il-6 production stimulated with the above lps. methods: hgf were stimulated with pg-, aa-, ec-lps of different concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 mg/l) for 24 h. and hgf were also stimulated with the combinations of 10 mg/l pg-, aa-, ec-lps and 10(-6) mol/l indomethacin respectively for 24 h. levels of il-11 and il-6 in the supernatants were quantitated by elisa. results: lps from aa, ec, at  the concentration of 10 mg/l and from pg at the concentrations 1, 10 mg/l significantly augmented il-11 production by hgf. il-6 production was also significantly increased by stimulation with aa-lps at concentrations 1, 10 mg/l and with ec-, pg-lps at concentrations 0.1, 1, 10 mg/l. in addition, il-11 production was lower than il-6 production by hgf stimulated with lps. indomethacin significantly inhibited il-6 and il-11 production in lps-stimulated  hgf. conclusions: aa-, pg-, ec-lps may significantly increase il-11 and il-6 level in the supernatants of hgf, and endogenous prostaglandin may upregulate il-11 and il-6 production in lps-stimulated hgf.

AB  == objectives: to study the short-term microbiological changes following full-mouth  compared with quadrant wise scaling and root planing (fmrp and qrp) as well as long-term effects. method: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into a test group treated in two sessions with subgingival scaling and root planing within 24 h (fmrp) and a control group treated quadrant by quadrant  in four sessions at intervals of one week (qrp). microbiological samples were taken in the two deepest pockets of the maxillary right quadrant immediately before treatment and after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. the samples were  evaluated by real-time pcr for quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as well as for total bacterial counts (tbc). results: treatment resulted in a tbc median log reduction of 0.75 (fmrp) and 0.72 (qrp). there were no differences between groups either for the short term (1 day-4 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.3150) or for long term (4-24 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.9671). likewise, no differences were detected for selected target bacteria. conclusion: the results of the present study showed similar microbiological outcomes following both treatment modalities.

TI  == gingival epithelial cell transcriptional responses to commensal and opportunistic oral microbial species.
AB  == transcriptional profiling and ontology tools were utilized to define the biological pathways of gingival epithelial cells modulated by coculture with the  oral commensal streptococcus gordonii and the opportunistic commensal fusobacterium nucleatum. overall, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii perturbed the gingival epithelial cell transcriptome much less significantly than the oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans perturbed the transcriptome, indicating that there was a greater degree of host adaptation by the commensal species (m. handfield, j. j. mans, g. zheng, m. c. lopez, s. mao, a. progulske-fox, g. narasimhan, h. v. baker, and r. j. lamont, cell. microbiol. 7:811-823, 2005). the biological pathways significantly impacted by f. nucleatum and s. gordonii included the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. differential regulation of gadd45 and dusp4, key components of the mapk pathway, was confirmed at the protein level by western blotting. modulation of the mapk pathway is likely to affect host cell proliferation and differentiation. in addition, both the mapk and toll-like receptor pathways ultimately converge on cytokine gene expression.  an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of secreted interleukin-6 (il-6) and il-8 demonstrated that f. nucleatum induced production of these cytokines, whereas s.  gordonii inhibited secretion from the epithelial cells. stimulation of secretion  of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cells may reflect the invasive phenotype of f. nucleatum and contribute to the greater pathogenic potential of f. nucleatum than of s. gordonii.

TI  == periodontal and oral microbiological status of an adult population undergoing haemodialysis: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the periodontal status and oral microbiological patterns of a population with end-stage renal disease (esrd), undergoing haemodialysis (hd). design: this was a cross-sectional study, involving 52 patients from the nephrology department and 52 matched control subjects. materials and methods: the subjects had a periodontal clinical  examination; subgingival plaque samples were taken and analysed using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test to detect porphyromas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were studied for candida and enterobacteriaceae. main outcome measures: most of the 104 subjects had some degree of loss of periodontal attachment (lpa) > or =3  mm [11 (10.5%) had severe lpa; 16 (15.4%) moderate lpa; and 64 (61.5%) mild lpa]. only 13 subjects (12.5%) presented good periodontal health. results: no statistically significant differences were found between the hd patients and the  control group regarding bleeding index, number of teeth, or percentage of lpa > or =3 mm. however, a statistically significant difference was seen in the degree  of oral hygiene. conclusions: on the basis of the findings presented here, we cannot associate esrd with more severe periodontal destruction. although hd patients presented a higher number of periodontopathic microorganisms than the matched controls, a prolonged duration of hd did not bear a statistically significant relationship with the percentage of sites with lpa > or =3 mm, specific microbiota or composition of biofilm.

TI  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide regulates matrix metalloproteinase, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase, and plasminogen activator production by human gingival fibroblasts: a potential role in connective tissue destruction.
AB  == fibroblasts, a major constituent of gingival connective tissue, can produce immunoregulatory cytokines and proteolytic enzymes that may contribute to tissue  destruction. in this study, we evaluated the production of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), tissue inhibitors of mmps (timps), and plasminogen activators by gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) produced by periodontopathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.  in addition, changes in the expression and phosphorylation state of fibroblast intracellular signaling proteins induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans lps were characterized using antibody microarrays. we showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps induced the production of a 50 kda plasminogen activator, mmp-2 and, to a lesser extent, mmp-3 by fibroblasts. the stimulation of fibroblasts with a. actinomycetemcomitans lps also resulted in the overproduction of timp-1, but had  no effect on the production of timp-2. comparable responses were also obtained with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum lps. the results of the microarray analyses showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps induced changes in the phosphorylation state and expression of gingival fibroblast intracellular signaling proteins. more specifically, they suggested that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps may induce both jun n-terminus protein-serine kinases (jnk) and mitogen-activated protein-serine kinase p38 alpha (p38alpha mapk) pathway activation, leading to increased activator protein-1 (ap-1) and nuclear factor kappa-b (nfkappab) activities, which in turn can stimulate mmp-2,  mmp-3, timp-1, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (upa) expression. this may contribute to periodontal connective tissue destruction.

TI  == association between infection of different strains of porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque and clinical parameters in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate subgingival infection frequencies of porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  strains with genetic variation in chinese chronic periodontitis (cp) patients and to evaluate its correlation with clinical parameters. methods: two multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were developed to detect the 16srdna, collagenase (prtc) and fimbria (fima) genes of p. gingivalis and the 16srdna, leukotoxin (lkta) and fimbria-associated protein (fap) genes of a. actinomycetemcomitans in 60 sulcus samples from 30 periodontal healthy subjects and in 122 subgingival plaque samples from 61 patients with cp. the pcr products  were further t-a cloned and sent for nucleotide sequence analysis. results: the 16srdna, prtc and fima genes of p. gingivalis were detected in 92.6%, 85.2% and 80.3% of the subgingival plaque samples respectively, while the 16srdna, lkta and fap genes of a. actinomycetemcomitans were in 84.4%, 75.4% and 50.0% respectively. nucleotide sequence analysis showed 98.62%~100% homology of the pcr products in these genes with the reported sequences. p. gingivalis strains with prtc+/fima+ and a. actinomycetemcomitans with lkta+ were predominant in deep pockets (>6 mm) or in sites with attachment loss > or =5 mm than in shallow pockets (3~4 mm) or in sites with attachment loss < or =2 mm (p<0.05). p. gingivalis strains with prtc+/fima+ also showed higher frequency in gingival index (gi)=3 than in gi=1 group (p<0.05). conclusion: infection of p. gingivalis  with prtc+/fima+ and a. actinomycetemcomitans with lkta+ correlates with periodontal destruction of cp in chinese. nonetheless p. gingivalis fima, prtc genes and a. actinomycetemcomitans lkta gene are closely associated with periodontal destruction, while a. actinomycetemcomitans fap gene is not.

TI  == identification of the microorganisms responsible for periodontopathy by multiplex rt-pcr.
AB  == the aim of our research was to identify by bacterial genomic dna analysis the prevalence of five different species of periodontopathogenic bacteria present in  the subgingival biofilm, specifically: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), bacterioides forsytus  (bf), treponema denticola (td). for the analysis we used the systematic multiplex-pcr-microdent kit with species-specific primers. we studied a group of  48 subjects, 18 males and 30 females, from 18 to 78 years of age. the initial clinical screening enabled us to select, among the group analysed, 24 subjects with signs of active periodontopathy (group a) and 24 patients without identifiable clinical evidence of the disease used as the control group (group b). within the two experimental groups (a and b), the test was found to be positive in 75% of subjects from group a, whereas the test was found to be negative in all the subjects from group b. our research shows that the multiplex-pcr system is reliable. furthermore, the sensitivity and simplicity of  this technique, as well as the decrease in working times and the possibility of identifying non-culturable bacteria, since the presence of viable organisms is not essential, make this technique indicated for the simultaneous identification  of periodontopathogenic bacteria and might, in perspective, provide a more effective clinical alternative to the techniques of bacterial typing of the subgingival plaque.

TI  == interleukin-1alpha stimulation in monocytes by periodontal bacteria: antagonistic effects of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontal pathogenic bacteria are associated with elevated levels of interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) but it is unclear if all species can induce cytokine production equally. porphyromonas gingivalis may be able antagonize il-1alpha induced by other species through the activity of its proteases or lipopolysaccharide (lps). monomac-6 cells and primary human monocytes were treated with culture supernatants from porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedius, veillonella atypical and prevotella nigrescens. il-1alpha protein levels were measured after 6 h of incubation. in addition, monocytes were co-stimulated with supernatants from p. gingivalis and other bacteria. the role of p. gingivalis proteases was tested using arg-x and lys-x mutant strains. the role of lps was investigated using purified p. gingivalis lps and polymixin depletion. all species tested induced significant il-1alpha production, but p. gingivalis was the weakest. co-stimulation of monocytes with p. gingivalis antagonized the ability of other bacterial species to induce il-1alpha production. this effect was at its greatest with c. rectus (resulting in a 70% reduction). gingipain mutant strains and chemical inhibition of protease activity did not reduce antagonistic activity. however, 100 ng/ml of p. gingivalis lps can reproduce the antagonistic activity of p. gingivalis culture supernatants. periodontitis-associated bacterial species stimulate il-1alpha production by monocytes. p. gingivalis can antagonize this effect, and its lps appears to be the crucial component. this study highlights the importance of mixed infections in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease because reduction of pro-inflammatory  cytokine levels may impair the ability of the host to tackle infection.

TI  == comparison of subgingival bacterial sampling with oral lavage for detection and quantification of periodontal pathogens by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: saliva has been studied for the presence of subgingival pathogens in  periodontitis patients. with the anaerobic culture technique, the discrepancy between salivary recovery and subgingival presence has been significant, which makes this approach not suitable for practical use in the microbial diagnosis of  periodontitis patients. the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique represents a very sensitive technique to detect and quantify bacterial pathogens. the aim of the study was to compare the presence and numbers of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, and micromonas micros in subgingival plaque and mouthwash  samples by the anaerobic culture and real-time pcr techniques. methods: pooled subgingival plaque samples and 10-ml mouthwash samples were collected from 21 adult patients with periodontitis and analyzed by quantitative anaerobic culture  and real-time pcr for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and m. micros. results: the detection frequency of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis in subgingival plaque was identical by culture and real-time pcr and was higher for p. intermedia and m. micros by real-time pcr. the highest detection frequencies for the target bacteria were found in mouthwash samples by real-time pcr. the additional value of the real-time pcr to detect target bacteria was 38% for p. gingivalis, 73% for t. forsythensis, 77% for p. intermedia, and 71% for m. micros. the sensitivity to detect target species in mouthwash by real-time pcr was 100% for all test species except for p. intermedia (93.8%). conclusions: rapid detection and quantification of periodontal pathogens in mouthwash samples are possible by real-time pcr. the  procedure is significantly less time-consuming than subgingival sampling with paper points. this approach to detect major periodontal pathogens in mouthwash samples may simplify microbial diagnosis in periodontitis patients and may be used to monitor periodontal treatment.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to compare the results of microbiological rna-probe analysis after subgingival plaque sampling applying two different strategies. methods: in 220 patients, clinical examinations were obtained prior to commencement of therapy for aggressive or generalized severe chronic periodontitis (n = 113), after combined mechanical and antibiotic anti-infective periodontal therapy (n = 43), or because of periodontal pockets despite adequate therapy (n = 64). subgingival plaque samples were obtained from  the three pockets with the deepest probing depths. two sterile paper points were  inserted simultaneously into the periodontal pockets. one paper point from each pocket was put into a separate transport vial; the second paper point was pooled  (multiple site test [mt3]) with paper points from each of the two other sampling  sites from the respective patient into a transport vial. the content of each vial was analyzed separately for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola (td) with a commercially available rna-probe test. results: for all tested pathogens, log-transformed numbers of bacteria were higher in pooled samples compared to the mean values for the separate samples (p < or =0.01). however, for td only, statistically significant differences in frequency were seen between the separate samples and mt3. these findings were observed over all samples as well as after evaluation of subgroups separately. conclusions: pooling of plaque samples increased the bacterial counts per analysis compared to separate samples and thus may increase the probability of detecting existing pathogens. however, this observation only was statistically significant for the frequency of td.

TI  == oral pathogens and allergic disease: results from the third national health and nutrition examination survey.
AB  == background: the hygiene hypothesis contends that fewer opportunities for infection have led to increases in the prevalences of asthma and other allergic diseases. objective: this study evaluated the association between asthma, wheeze, and hay fever and antibodies to 2 oral bacteria associated with periodontal disease. methods: data were obtained from the third national health and nutrition examination survey. serum levels of igg antibodies to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were quantified by enzyme-linked immunoassays in 9385 subjects age 12 years and older. the outcomes  were current asthma, wheeze, and hay fever. odds ratios (ors) representing a 1-log-unit increase in igg concentrations were estimated with logistic regression. ors were adjusted for 8 confounders and weighted to represent the us  population. results: for each disease outcome, geometric mean antibody concentrations were higher in persons without the disease outcome than with the disease outcome. for a 1-log-unit increase in p gingivalis antibody concentration, adjusted ors were 0.41 (95% ci, 0.20-0.87) for asthma, 0.43 (0.23-0.78) for wheeze, and 0.45 (0.23-0.93) for hay fever. for a actinomycetemcomitans, those ors were 0.56 (0.19-1.72), 0.39 (0.17-0.86), and 0.48 (0.23-1.03), respectively. conclusion: consistent with the hygiene hypothesis, higher concentrations of igg antibodies to p gingivalis were significantly associated with lower prevalences of asthma, wheeze, and hay fever, and higher concentrations of igg antibodies to a actinomycetemcomitans were significantly associated with a lower prevalence of wheeze. clinical implications: colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria and other microbes might play a protective role in the etiology of allergic disease.

TI  == molecular analysis of the subgingival microbiota in health and disease.
AB  == this investigation provides molecular analyses of the periodontal microbiota in health and disease. subgingival samples from 47 volunteers with healthy gingivae  or clinically diagnosed chronic periodontitis were characterized by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with primers specific for the  v2-v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rrna gene. a hierarchical dendrogram was constructed from band patterns. all unique pcr amplicons (dgge bands) were sequenced for identity. samples were also analyzed for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis by multiplex pcr. associations of patient age, gender, and smoking status together with the presence of each unique band and putative periodontal pathogens with disease were assessed by logistic regression. periodontal pockets  were colonized by complex eubacterial communities (10 to 40 distinct dgge bands)  with substantial individual variation in the community profile. species diversity in health and disease was determined by the shannon-weaver index of diversity and compared by the mann-whitney u test. sequence analyses of dgge amplicons indicated the occurrence of many nontypical oral species and eubacteria previously associated with this environment. with the exception of t. forsythensis, the putative pathogens were not detected by dgge. multiplex pcr, however, detected t. forsythensis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. gingivalis in 9% 16%, and 29% of the patients with disease, respectively. the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly associated with disease (p < 0.01). statistical analyses indicated that the presence of treponema socranskii and pseudomonas sp. was a significant predictor of disease (p < 0.05) and that there  was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in terms of eubacterial species diversity between health and disease.

AB  == a visual coaggregation study showed specific interspecies coaggregation between an actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype c strain and porphyromonas gingivalis strains atcc 33277 and 381. we mutagenized a. actinomycetemcomitans sunyab 67 (serotype c) with transposon is903phikan and isolated three transposon  insertion mutants that had a reduced ability to aggregate with p. gingivalis atcc 33277. the three transposon insertions in the mutant strains mapped to the genes  at orf12, orf13 and orf16 of the gene cluster responsible for producing serotype  c-specific polysaccharide antigen (spa). western blot analysis with serotype c-specific antibody showed that these strains did not produce the high-molecular-mass smear of spa. furthermore, two spa-deficient mutants and an spa-producing mutant were constructed. the two spa-deficient mutants were deficient for orf12 and orf14, which are necessary for the synthesis of serotype  c-spa, and the spa-producing mutant was deficient for orf17, which is not related to spa synthesis. the orf12- and orf14-deficient mutants showed reduced ability to aggregate with p. gingivalis atcc 33277, while the orf17-deficient mutant aggregated with atcc 33277 to the same extent as wild-type sunyab 67. our findings suggest that serotype c-spa of a. actinomycetemcomitans mediates coaggregation with p. gingivalis atcc 33277.

AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == periodontal infections and cardiovascular disease: the heart of the matter.
AB  == background: oral infection models have emerged as useful tools to study the hypothesis that infection is a cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk factor. periodontal infections are a leading culprit, with studies reporting associations between periodontal disease and cvd. the results, however, have varied, and it often is unclear what conclusions can be drawn from these data. summary: an association exists between periodontal disease and cvd. it is unknown, however, whether this relationship is causal or coincidental. early studies predominantly  used nonspecific clinical and radiographic definitions of periodontal disease as  surrogates for infectious exposure. while most studies demonstrated positive associations between periodontal disease and cvd, not all studies were positive,  and substantial variations in results were evident. more recent studies have enhanced the specificity of infectious exposure definitions by measuring systemic antibodies to selected periodontal pathogens or by directly measuring and quantifying oral microbiota from subgingival dental plaque. results from these studies have shown positive associations between periodontal disease and cvd. conclusions: evidence continues to support an association among periodontal infections, atherosclerosis and vascular disease. ongoing observational and focused pilot intervention studies may inform the design of large-scale clinical  intervention studies. recommending periodontal treatment for the prevention of atherosclerotic cvd is not warranted based on scientific evidence. periodontal treatment must be recommended on the basis of the value of its benefits for the oral health of patients, recognizing that patients are not healthy without good oral health. however, the emergence of periodontal infections as a potential risk factor for cvd is leading to a convergence in oral and medical care that can only benefit the patients and public health.

TI  == serum antibody response to periodontal pathogens and herpes simplex virus in relation to classic risk factors of cardiovascular disease.
AB  == background: increasing evidence links chronic infections, especially burden of several infections, with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (cvd). we studied joint immune response against two major periodontal pathogens and herpes  simplex virus (hsv) in relation to established risk factors of cvd. methods: serum antibody levels to hsv, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were determined by elisa. the study included 1107 subjects, 734 from finland and 373 from russia. results: combined antibody response to periodontal pathogens was associated inversely (or, 95% ci) with high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol concentration (beta = 0.35; 0.20, 0.60; p < 0.001) and directly with hsv antibody quartiles: compared with the first quartile, ors (95% ci) for quartiles 2-4 were 1.43 (0.88-2.32), 1.74 (1.07-2.82), and 1.89 (1.18-3.02), respectively (p for trend <0.001), after adjusting for age, gender, area, education, smoking, bmi, alcohol, triglycerides, and number of teeth. in linear regression analysis, the 3-pathogen antibody score (comprising antibody levels against periodontal pathogens and hsv) was inversely  associated with hdl cholesterol concentration (beta = -0.067/1 mmol/l; -0.235, -0.018; p < 0.05). conclusions: hsv infection may promote infection by periodontal pathogens. furthermore, the infectious burden comprising hsv and periodontitis may increase the risk for cvd by clearly decreasing hdl cholesterol concentrations.

TI  == periodontal therapy in siblings with papillon-lefevre syndrome and tinea capitis: a report of two cases.
AB  == objective: report of clinical and microbiological periodontal findings before and 6 months after treatment of two siblings with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and tinea capitis. methods: two brothers, rg 3 years and ng 5 years of age, were referred for treatment due to premature mobility of their deciduous teeth. probing depths (ppd), attachment levels (pal-v), and furcation involvements were  examined clinically. panoramic radiographs were taken. subgingival plaque samples within the deepest pocket of each tooth were taken and analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. one-stage full-mouth scaling  and extraction of hopeless teeth were performed under general anaesthesia, followed by systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole for 7 days. clinical and microbiological analyses were performed 6 months after treatment. results: before treatment, both siblings had exhibited ppd of up to 13 mm, class iii furcation defects at four teeth, and marginal suppuration. aa was detected in both patients and at all teeth at levels ranging from 3.0 x 10(2) to 5.1 x 10(6). both patients exhibited palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis. seven teeth were extracted from rg,  and nine from ng. six months after treatment, ppd had been reduced to <or=5 mm. aa was not detected in any of the remaining teeth. conclusion: even periodontally affected deciduous teeth of pls patients can be treated successfully. suppression of aa to below detection level seems to be of high significance.

TI  == antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria.
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. tap water was electrolyzed in a water vessel  using platinum cell technology. the electrolyzed tap water (called puri-water) was put in contact with five major periodontopathogens or toothbrushes contaminated with these bacteria for 30 sec. in addition, puri-water was used as  a mouthwash for 30 sec in 16 subjects and the antibacterial effect on salivary bacteria was evaluated. puri-water significantly reduced the growth of all periodontopathogens in culture and on toothbrushes, and that of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in saliva, when compared to the effect of tap water. it also significantly reduced mutans streptococci growing on mitis salivarius-bacitracin  agar. our results demonstrate that the electrolyzed tap water is effective as a mouthwash and for toothbrush disinfection.

TI  == periodontal status in smokers and never-smokers: clinical findings and real-time  polymerase chain reaction quantification of putative periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: smoking is a well-known risk factor for destructive periodontal disease, but its relationship with periodontal status and subgingival microbiota  remains unclear. inherent limitations of microbiological methods previously used  may partly explain these mixed results, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been presented as a valid alternative. the aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical condition and microbiological profile of patients with chronic periodontitis as related to the habit of smoking. methods: fifty patients (33 to 59 years old), 25 smokers and 25 never-smokers, constituted the sample. the visible plaque index (vpi), gingival bleeding index (gbi), bleeding on probing (bop), periodontal probing depth (pd), clinical attachment loss (cal), and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) volume were recorded. real-time pcr quantified porphyromonas gingivalis, micromonas micros, dialister pneumosintes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and total bacteria in subgingival samples. results: smokers and never-smokers showed similar values for vpi, gbi, and bop. smokers had deeper pd in buccal/lingual sites and higher cal independently of the tooth surface. the gcf volume was smaller in smokers, independent of the pd. similar amounts of total bacteria and p. gingivalis were observed for both groups. significantly higher numbers of d. pneumosintes and m. micros were present in smokers and associated with moderate and deep pockets. when heavy smokers were considered, higher counts of total bacteria, m. micros, and d. pneumosintes were observed. conclusions: smoking seems to have a detrimental impact on the periodontal status and microbiological profile of patients with periodontitis. compared to never-smokers, smokers had deeper pockets, greater periodontal destruction, and higher counts of some putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == java project on periodontal diseases. the natural development of periodontitis: risk factors, risk predictors and risk determinants.
AB  == objective: to identify risk factors, risk predictors and risk determinants for onset and progression of periodontitis. material and methods: for this longitudinal, prospective study all subjects in the age range 15-25 years living  in a village of approximately 2000 inhabitants at a tea estate on western java, indonesia, were selected. baseline examination was carried out in 1987 and follow-up examinations in 1994 and 2002. in 2002, 128 subjects could be retrieved from the original group of 255. baseline examination included evaluation of plaque, bleeding on probing, calculus, pocket depth, attachment loss and presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, spirochetes and motile microorganisms. results: the mean attachment loss increased from 0.33 mm in 1987 to 0.72 mm in 1994 and 1.97 mm in 2002. analysis identified the amount of subgingival calculus and subgingival presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans as risk factors, and age as a risk determinant, for the onset of disease. regarding disease progression, the number of sites with a probing depth > or = 5 mm and the number of sites with recession were identified  as risk predictors and male gender as a risk determinant. conclusion: screening of these parameters early in life could be helpful in the prevention of onset and progression of periodontal diseases.

TI  == periodontal healing after non-surgical therapy with a modified sonic scaler: a controlled clinical trial.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and microbiological healing outcomes following non-surgical periodontal therapy using a modified sonic scaler system versus scaling and root planing (s/rp) with hand instruments. material and methods: the study comprised 20 chronic periodontitis patients. using a split-mouth design, both treatment modalities were randomly applied to one quadrant of the upper and lower jaws. clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 months after treatment. furthermore, post-operative hypersensitivity was investigated. the wilcoxon signed-rank test (alpha = 0.05) was used for statistical analysis. results: with both therapy methods, periodontal conditions showed statistically significant clinical and microbiological improvements after 4 weeks and 6 months. hypersensitive teeth were found only 4 weeks after s/rp. besides a significantly better bleeding on probing reduction in deep s/rp sites and less time required for root instrumentation by the sonic scaler, no other clinical and microbiological parameters revealed significant differences between sites treated with the sonic  scaler or s/rp. conclusion: the sonic scaler system and s/rp seem to provide similarly favourable periodontal healing results, although in deep pockets s/rp appeared to achieve a better resolution of inflammation.

TI  == microbiological composition associated with interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in subjects undergoing supportive periodontal therapy.
AB  == background: interleukin-1 gene polymorphism (il-1 gene) has been associated with  periodontitis. the present study examined the subgingival microbiota by il-1 gene status in subjects undergoing supportive periodontal therapy (spt). methods: a total of 151 subjects with known il-1 gene status (il-1a +4845/il-1b -3954) (il-1 gene) were included in this study. clinical data and subgingival plaque samples (40 taxa) were collected. these taxa were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization method. results: gender, smoking habits (n-par tests), age, and clinical periodontal conditions did not differ by il-1 gene status. il-1 gene-negative subjects had a higher total bacterial load (mean difference, 480.4  x 10(5); 95% confidence interval [ci], 77 to 884 x 10(5); p <0.02). the levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (mean difference, 30.7 x 10(5); 95% ci, 2.2  to 59.5 x 10(5); p <0.05), eubacterium nodatum (mean difference, 4.2 x 10(5); 95% ci, 0.6 to 7.8 x 10(5); p <0.02), porphyromonas gingivalis (mean difference, 17.9 x 10(5); 95% ci, 1.2 to 34.5 x 10(5); p <0.05), and streptococcus anginosus (mean difference, 4.0 x 10(5); 95% ci, 0.2 to 7.2 x 10(5); p <0.05) were higher in il-1 gene-negative subjects, an observation specifically found at sites with probing depths <5.0 mm. conclusions: bleeding on probing did not differ by il gene status, reflecting clinical spt efficacy. il-1 gene-negative subjects had higher  levels of periodontal pathogens. this may suggest that among subjects undergoing  spt, a lower bacterial load is required in il-1 gene-positive subjects to develop the same level of periodontitis as in il-1 gene-negative subjects.

TI  == changes of immunoresponse in balb/c mice neonatally treated with periodontopathic bacterial endotoxin.
AB  == the aim of this investigation was to analyze the effects of early life exposure to periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharides on immunoresponse. newborn balb/c mice were subcutaneously injected with 20 ng lipopolysaccharide of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or escherichia coli daily for 2 days, starting within 24 h after birth. the treated mice were given intraperitoneal injections of bovine serum albumin at 180 and 187 days of age. seventeen hours after each injection, the mice were bled and sera were separated. their sera were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. the mean interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-6 and immunoglobulin e levels  in the sera of mice treated neonatally with p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide were significantly higher than those of the controls. however, in all cases, no significant difference was noted between mice treated neonatally with a. actinomycetemcomitans- or e. coli lipopolysaccharide and control mice. these data suggest that neonatal exposure to p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces changes in immunological responses when the mice reach maturity.

TI  == inflammation, heat shock proteins and periodontal pathogens in atherosclerosis: an immunohistologic study.
AB  == background: inflammation is a significant component of atherosclerosis lesions. bacteria, including periodontopathogens, have been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial  groel with human heat shock protein 60 has been suggested as a link between infections and atherosclerosis. methods: in this study, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and the presence of human heat shock protein 60 and groel were examined in 31 carotid endarterectomy specimens. additionally, monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the presence of six bacteria, including those implicated in periodontal disease. results: the inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lesions was dominated by cd14(+) macrophages and cd4(+) t cells. most cells of the infiltrate as well as the endothelium were hla-dr(+), indicating activation; however, there was an absence of cd25 expression, demonstrating that  the activated t cells were not proliferating. few cd1a(+) and cd83(+) cells were  noted. human heat shock protein 60 expression was evident on endothelial cells and cells with the appearance of smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes. groel and bacteria were detected within intimal cells. chlamydia pneumoniae, porphyromonas  gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found in 21%, 52%, 34%, 34%, 41%, and 17% of arteries, respectively. conclusion: these results give evidence for a  specific immune response associated with atherosclerosis. whether bacteria initiate the observed inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions is not clear; however, the present study shows that maintenance of inflammation may be enhanced by the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria on the tongue dorsum of elderly people.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of oral bacteria  on the dorsum of the tongue. in addition, the relationship between the number of  teeth and the microflora present on the coating of the tongue in a population of  85-year-old people was assessed. subjects and methods: two hundred and five individuals (89 males, 116 females) from the same geographical area who were 85 years of age were examined. five periodontopathic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola) and one cariogenic bacterium (streptococcus mutans) were analysed using a polymerase chain reaction assay of tongue samples from the population. results: periodontal bacteria-positive individuals have more teeth than that of periodontal bacteria-negative people. between the periodontal bacteria-positive and -negative individuals, there were significant differences in the mean number of teeth for p. gingivalis (p<0.0001), t. denticola (p<0.001), f. nucleatum (p=0.002), and t. forsythia (p=0.005), while there were no significant differences for a. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.998) or s. mutans (p=0.147). conclusions: a wide range of species, including anaerobes, was detected in 85-year-old subjects. it was found that the detection of periodontal bacteria on the tongue coating increased with the number of teeth. there was a positive relationship between the tooth number and periodontopathic bacteria, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that tongue  care is essential for preventing oral disease and needs to be part of any oral care programme in elderly people.

TI  == evaluation of peri-implant microbiota using the polymerase chain reaction in completely edentulous patients before and after placement of implant-supported prostheses submitted to immediate load.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate, by means of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in the mandibular arch of completely edentulous subjects before implant placement and 4 and 6 months after the placement of mandibular implant-supported fixed prostheses. materials and methods: fifteen patients had bacterial plaque collected with sterile paper points before implant placement (ie, when they were completely edentulous) and at 3 sites on the peri-implant sulci displaying the largest probing depths after placement of 5 implants. results: for the edentulous arch, a actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 13.3% of subjects, p intermedia was detected in 46.7% of subjects, and there was no detection of p gingivalis. after 4 and 6 months of implant placement, a actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 60% and 73.3% respectively; p intermedia in 46.7% and 53.3% respectively; and p gingivalis in 46.7% and 53.3%, respectively.  discussion: future diagnosis should not be restricted to distinguishing individuals at risk of peri-implant disease. such individuals should be identified by the employment of microbiologic methods and knowledge of the multifactorial nature of the host response to the action of microorganisms. conclusions: the longer the implants were in the oral cavity, the higher the occurrence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia in the peri-implant sulci of completely edentulous patients rehabilitated with mandibular implant-supported fixed prostheses was, without any clinical or radiographic evidence indicating peri-implant disease in the studied period.

TI  == [quantitative analysis of periodontal pathogens in aggressive periodontitis patients in a japanese population].
AB  == the aim of the present study was to clarify the relationship between the relative/absolute numbers of periodontal bacteria and different types of periodontitis. fifteen patients with localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp), 25 patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and 28 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) were included in this study. saliva and subgingival plaque samples were collected from all subjects for microbiological analysis. the prevalence and proportions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were determined by conventional pcr and real-time pcr. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva was significantly higher in lagp patients (46.7%) and gagp patients (40.0%) than that in cp patients (14.3%). the mean proportion of a. actinomycetemcomitans in lagp patients (4.42%) was significantly higher than that in gagp patients (0.59%) and cp patients (0.37%) in saliva. in subgingival plaque, lagp patients showed a significantly higher mean proportion of t. forsythensis (19.8%) than cp patients (7.45%). in conclusion, a. actinomycetemcomitans was the more predominant periodontopathic bacteria in lagp  than in gagp and cp. the increased proportion of t. forsythensis might relate to  lagp, in addition to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results indicate that real-time pcr analysis is useful for the evaluation of the bacterial profiles in  different types of periodontitis.

TI  == langerhans' cell histiocytosis in a 5-year-old girl: evidence of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: langerhans' cell histiocytosis (lch) is a rare disorder characterized by langerhans' cell proliferation in various organs or tissues. when periodontal  tissue is involved, clinical manifestations can vary from gingival recession and  pocket formation to severe alveolar bone loss. this case report describes periodontal pathogens found in the pockets of involved primary teeth. methods: a  5-year-old girl with lch presented with loose teeth. intraoral examination and radiographs revealed deep pockets and severe bone loss around all primary molars. bacterial samples were obtained from saliva and subgingival plaque and analyzed for the presence of five periodontopathic bacteria using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. due to severe periodontal destruction, all primary molars  were extracted, and a gingival biopsy was taken from tooth t to confirm the diagnosis of lch. results: the biopsy specimen revealed the histologic features of lch. the patient was diagnosed as having periodontitis as a manifestation of lch. pcr results of subgingival plaque from lch-affected molars indicated the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was absent from these teeth. no tested bacteria were found  in the non-affected anterior teeth. conclusions: the bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease were detected in subgingival plaque samples from this lch patient. more microbiological data are required to understand the role of these bacteria in lch-associated periodontal destruction.

TI  == relationship of serum advanced glycation end products with deterioration of periodontitis in type 2 diabetes patients.
AB  == background: a close relationship between diabetes and chronic periodontitis has been demonstrated. we previously found that porphyromonas gingivalis with the type ii fima gene is an infectious factor closely associated with the deterioration seen in diabetic periodontitis patients. in the present study, we examined whether other biomarkers are related to the development and deterioration of periodontitis often seen in type 2 diabetic individuals. methods: a total of 97 type 2 diabetes patients with and without periodontitis were recruited, and their periodontal and diabetic conditions were analyzed. the  ratio (%) of teeth with an attachment loss >5 mm among all teeth in each subject  was used as an index of periodontal deterioration. peripheral blood was tested for levels of glycated hemoglobin (hba1c), advanced glycation end products (ages), c-reactive protein (crp), and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-alpha and interleukin [il]-1beta). subgingival plaque samples were also examined for the occurrences of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: serum ages were significantly associated with deterioration of periodontitis, whereas no other serum biochemical marker or bacterial occurrence showed a clear relationship with that condition. conclusion: ages may be factors associated with diabetic periodontitis and may be useful as biomarkers that reflect such deterioration.

TI  == characterization of patients presenting for treatment to a university refractory  periodontal diseases unit: three case reports.
AB  == background: of the many forms of periodontal disease, refractory periodontal diseases are the least characterized. they are defined as the continued degeneration of the periodontium despite adequate management. this has led to the suggestion that there may be a systemic component that is a contributing factor to the development of this condition. the objectives of this report were to follow the progression of clinical changes associated with periodontal disease over a number of years in this unique population and review various hematologic and microbiologic factors that may be contributing to the disease progression. methods: three subjects were profiled. they were referred to the refractory periodontal disease unit at the university of toronto by periodontists or general practitioners in the southern ontario region. complete medical and dental histories were obtained along with baseline clinical measurements. periodontal examinations were facilitated with the use of a computer-assisted periodontal probe. a microbiologic analysis using immunofluorescence techniques was able to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and spirochetes. a hematologic analysis, including a complete blood count (cbc), immune profile, and glycosylated hemoglobin assay, was also performed. results: the clinical presentation revealed that patients receiving adequate maintenance therapy and with good to excellent oral hygiene demonstrated sites with continual loss of attachment. few periodontal pathogens were detected. however, the most significant finding appeared to be the report elevated levels of cd8+ cells within this group of patients compared to normal laboratory ranges. conclusions: this report is an attempt at characterizing a unique population within the periodontal realm. the long-term monitoring of these patients allowed for an assessment of factors that  may be involved in the continued decline of the periodontal health of these patients. based on the immune profile, it is possible that a hyperresponsive state may be the primary feature of this population. future assessments, including full-mouth interleukin (il)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-8 levels, may assist in characterizing this population further, with the goal of producing markers that will assist clinicians in predicting treatment outcome.

TI  == inhibition of proinflammatory activities of major periodontal pathogens by aqueous extracts from elder flower (sambucus nigra).
AB  == background: prolonged induction of excessive levels of inflammatory mediators contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic disease states, such as periodontitis. it is thus important to develop safe and effective anti-inflammatory strategies for therapeutic reasons. in this study, we determined the ability of aqueous extracts from elder flower (sambucus nigra) to inhibit the proinflammatory activity of major virulence factors from the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas  gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. methods: monocytes/macrophages or neutrophils were incubated with whole cells of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, or purified components thereof (lipopolysaccharide and fimbriae) in the absence or presence of elder flower extract and were assayed for cytokine production, integrin activation, or induction of the oxidative burst. results: the elder flower extract was found to  potently inhibit all proinflammatory activities tested. investigation of the underlying mechanisms revealed that the anti-inflammatory extract inhibited activation of the nuclear transcription factor kappab and of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. conclusion: the elder flower extract displays useful anti-inflammatory  properties that could be exploited therapeutically for the control of inflammation in human periodontitis.

TI  == clarithromycin reduces recurrent cardiovascular events in subjects without periodontitis.
AB  == inflammation leading to acute coronary syndrome may be triggered by bacteria causing periodontal infection. we investigated if recurrence of cardiovascular events in unstable coronary patients are associated with periodontitis or microbiological/serological markers of it. periodontitis-related parameters of 141 patients with acute non-q-wave infarction or unstable angina pectoris, who participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with clarithromycin for  3 months, were adjusted to the occurrence of a recurrent cardiovascular event during a follow-up period (average 519 days). in the age group under 65 years the patients with periodontitis had a univariate odds ratios (or) 95% confidence intervals (95% ci) of 5.0 (1.02-24.55) for a recurrent cardiovascular event in comparison with patients without periodontitis. dental status correlated positively with serum lipopolysaccharide concentrations and combined igg antibody response to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. the end point frequency did not differ between clarithromycin and placebo groups  in bacterium-positive, seropositive, or periodontitis patients. fewer end points  in clarithromycin group were seen in bacterium-negative, seronegative, edentulous, and non-periodontitis patients. periodontitis and edentulousness are  associated with recurrent cardiovascular events, especially in younger patients.  long-term clarithromycin therapy seems to be beneficial in prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events in non-periodontitis but not in periodontitis patients.

TI  == inhibitory effects of a super pulsed carbon dioxide laser at low energy density on periodontopathic bacteria and lipopolysaccharide in vitro.
AB  == objective and background: previous studies have described the effect of irradiation by a carbon dioxide (co2) laser at high energy density on oral bacteria, and various side-effects have also been observed. however, no published studies have examined the effect of irradiation by a co2 laser at low energy density on oral bacteria. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of super pulsed co2 laser irradiation on periodontopathic bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (lps). methods: bacterial suspensions of two species of periodontopathic bacteria received laser irradiation at energy densities of 0-12.5 j/cm2. the suspensions were then spread over agar plates and incubated anaerobically. the bactericidal effects were evaluated based on colony formation. samples of lps were laser-irradiated at energy densities of 0-12.5 j/cm2. the biological activity was measured, and lps was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). results: the irradiation at low energy densities of 7.5 and 12.5 j/cm2 killed more than 99.9 and 99.999% of porphyromonas gingivalis and more than 99% of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was sterilized by the irradiation at 7.5 j/cm2. lps biological activity was significantly decreased by laser irradiation at energy densities of more than 7.5 j/cm2 (p < 0.05), and the components of lps analyzed by sds-page was diminished non-specifically. conclusion: the results indicate that co2 laser irradiation at low power is capable of bactericidal effect on periodontopathic bacteria and decreasing lps activity.

AB  == periodontal disease infection with oral biofilm microorganisms initiates host immune response and signs of periodontitis, including bone resorption. this review delineates some mechanisms underlying the host immune response in periodontal infection and alveolar bone resorption. activated t lymphocytes have  been historically implicated in experimental periodontal bone resorption. an experimental rat adoptive transfer/gingival challenge periodontal disease model has been demonstrated to require antigen-specific t lymphocytes and gingival instillation of antigen and lps for bone resorption. interference with costimulatory interactions between t cells and antigen-presenting cells abrogated bone resorption, further emphasizing the significance of immune response in periodontal disease. receptor activator of nuclear factor kappab ligand (rankl),  a critical osteoclast differentiation factor, is expressed on t lymphocytes in human periodontal disease as determined by immunohistochemical and confocal microscopic analyses. interference with rankl by systemic administration of osteoprotegerin (opg), the decoy receptor for (and inhibitor of) rankl, resulted  in abrogation of periodontal bone resorption in the rat model. this finding indicated that t cell-mediated bone resorption is rankl-dependent. in additional  experiments, treatment of t cell-transferred rats with kaliotoxin (a scorpion venom potassium channel inhibitor) resulted in decreases in t-cell rankl expression, diminished induction of rankl-dependent osteoclastogenesis, and abrogation of bone resorption, implicating an important role of immune response/rankl expression in osteoclastogenesis/bone resorption. in other experiments, adoptive transfer of antigen-specific, rankl-expressing b cells, and infection with the antigen-bearing actinobaccillus actinomycetemcomitans gave rise to periodontal bone resorption, indicating that b cells also have the capacity to mediate bone resorption, probably via rankl expression. in humans, prominent t lymphocytes have been identified in periodontal disease, and diseased tissues showed elevated rankl mrna expression, as well as decreased opg mrna expression. mononuclear cells from periodontal lesions involving t cells and b cells of patients induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. in summary, a biofilm interface initiates immune cell infiltration, stimulating osteoclastogenesis/bone resorption in periodontal disease. this resorption can be ameliorated by inhibition of rankl activity or by diminishing immune cell stimulation. these two procedures, if localized, have the potential to lead to the prevention or therapeutic management of periodontal disease and therefore require further study.

TI  == plasma levels of mannan-binding lectin in relation to periodontitis and smoking.
AB  == background: mannan-binding lectin (mbl) is an important molecule of innate immunity; it acts as an opsonin and stimulates the classical complement pathway.  moreover, it has been suggested that mbl acts as a weak acute phase protein. we investigated whether mbl levels are increased in periodontitis, and we tested whether individuals deficient for mbl are more susceptible to periodontitis. methods: a total of 219 subjects participated in the study. plasma samples from 115 periodontitis patients and 104 healthy controls were taken, and the mbl levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). mbl levels were analyzed in relation to periodontitis, taking into consideration age, gender, ethnic and educational background, and smoking status. in some analyses,  subjects with mbl plasma levels <0.8 microg/ml were considered mbl deficient. results: mbl plasma concentrations were not significantly different in moderate and severe periodontitis compared to controls (1.6, 1.4, and 1.6 microg/ml, respectively). also, the prevalence of mbl deficiency was not found to be different between controls and moderate and severe periodontitis (45%, 37%, and 36%). however, among all subjects and among the non-deficient subjects, mbl levels were markedly increased in heavy smokers (>10 cigarettes per day), irrespective of periodontal disease status, in comparison to non-smokers and light smokers. mbl plasma levels did not show a correlation with plasma c-reactive protein (crp) and were also not related to the prevalence of specific  periodontal pathogens. conclusions: mbl levels were not elevated in periodontitis, and mbl deficiency was not related to susceptibility for periodontitis. the fact that mbl levels were higher among heavy smokers is the subject of further investigation.

TI  == distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  == objective: we analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species  known as the red complex (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. methods: one hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were  randomly selected from patients treated at the pedodontic clinic of osaka university dental hospital. saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. genomic dna was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was the most  frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by c. sputigena, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis, while c. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the children. the  detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. conclusions: our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of periodontal abscesses.
AB  == background/aim: the knowledge of clinical features, microbial composition and susceptibility to antimicrobials of periodontal abscesses has recently improved.  this descriptive clinical and microbiological study provides more information on  the characteristics of periodontal abscesses. materials and methods: clinical parameters and subgingival samples were examined from 54 subjects presenting 60 periodontal abscesses. samples were cultured for anaerobic and facultative bacteria, and data were expressed as frequency detection and mean proportion of isolation for microorganisms. selected isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens were used to test susceptibility to amoxicillin, azithromycin, tetracycline and metronidazole. statistical descriptive analysis was conducted. results: most periodontal abscesses were present in patients with ongoing chronic periodontitis. bleeding on probing, tumefaction and suppuration were present in almost all abscesses. affected teeth were lower anterior teeth, upper anterior teeth and lower molars. the subgingival microbiota was composed of periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium spp. (75%), p. intermedia/nigrescens (60%), p. gingivalis (51%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (30%). some periodontopathogens showed antimicrobial resistance to tetracycline, metronidazole and amoxicillin, but not to azithromycin. conclusions: periodontal abscesses showed typical clinical features associated with untreated periodontitis, and the organisms identified were important periodontopathic bacteria. rationale use of antibiotic  adjunctive therapy in abscess treatment should be taken into account.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens and markers of systemic inflammation.
AB  == aim: we examined the relationship between serum antibodies against porphyromonas  gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and plasma fibrinogen and serum c-reactive protein (crp) in a nationally representative sample. methods: data on 2,973 participants aged 40 years and older from the third national health and nutrition examination survey, second phase (1991-1994) were used. three logistic regression models adjusted for gender, race, educational attainment, diabetes, cigarette smoking, body mass index (bmi), and other inflammatory conditions were constructed, based on three different assumptions: (a) no access  to dental/periodontal data; (b) knowledge of number of teeth present but not of clinical periodontal status; and (c) knowledge of both dental and clinical periodontal status. results: high fibrinogen (>400 mg/dl) was unrelated to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans antibodies in all models. high crp (>0.4  mg/dl) was related to high antibody levels to p. gingivalis in models a [odds ratios (or) 1.63, 95% confidence intervals (ci) 1.15-2.32], b (or 1.69, 95% ci 1.18-2.41), and c (or 1.58, 95% ci 1.12-2.23). in model c, high crp was related to >30% extent of attachment loss of >or=3 mm (or 1.58, 95% ci 1.19-2.08). antibodies to a. actinomycetemcomitans were not associated with high crp levels in any model. conclusions: high serum titre to p. gingivalis and the presence of  periodontal disease are independently related to high crp levels.

TI  == involvement of porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotype in treatment outcome following non-surgical periodontal therapy.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is considered a critical pathogen in periodontal diseases. it is classified into six genotypes based on diversity of the fima gene encoding fimbrillin. the present study evaluated the involvement of the fima genotype in treatment outcome following non-surgical periodontal therapy. methods: chronic periodontitis patients were enrolled in this study; all received clinical and microbiological examinations at baseline. the detection of  subgingival species and identification of p. gingivalis fima genotypes were performed using polymerase chain reaction based methods. in total, 160 p. gingivalis positive sites with bleeding on probing (bop) and a probing depth of > or =4 mm were accepted. they were followed up after scaling and root planing. results: longitudinal investigation indicated that fima type i positive sites at  baseline were followed by a significantly higher frequency of persistent bop after treatment than type i negative sites (51.6% versus 27.9%), while types ib and ii were not. type i positive sites also showed more persistence of tannerella forsythensis and p. gingivalis after treatment than type i negative sites. in post-treatment investigation, type i positive sites showed higher frequencies of  bop and t. forsythensis detection than type i negative sites (77.8% versus 43.5%  and 100% versus 76.1%, respectively). conclusions: bop in initially type i positive sites showed little improvement with treatment, and the combined persistence of fima type i and t. forsythensis seemed to be involved in this poor treatment outcome. the present study demonstrated the potential of p. gingivalis  fima type i as a predictor of persistent bop after treatment.

TI  == cd14 and tlr4 gene polymorphisms in adult periodontitis.
AB  == bacterial deposits, smoking, and host genetic factors play a major role in an individual's predisposition to periodontitis. bacterial components are recognized by cd14 and toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4), resulting in a nf-kappab-based inflammatory response. we hypothesized that functional cd14 and tlr4 polymorphisms contribute to periodontitis susceptibility. we aimed to investigate the occurrence of cd14-260c>t, tlr4 299asp>gly, and 399thr>ile gene polymorphisms in adult periodontititis. dna was collected from 100 patients with severe periodontitis and from 99 periodontally healthy controls. the gene polymorphisms  were determined by the pcr technique. the presence of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and whether the subjects smoked, was included in the analyses. the cd14-260t/t genotype was found in 34.0% of periodontitis patients and in 20.2% of controls. logistic regression analysis adjusted for gender, age, smoking, and prevalence of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans showed an association between the cd14-260t/t genotype and periodontitis (p = 0.004, or 3.0, 95% ci 1.4-6.9). we conclude that the cd14-260t/t genotype contributes to the susceptibility to severe periodontitis in dutch caucasians.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == a searchable database for proteomes of oral microorganisms.
AB  == an online database of proteomes for two-dimensional electrophoresis (2de) gel data was constructed and it is now freely accessible through a web-based interface. proteins from three oral bacteria, streptococcus mutans ua159, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans hk1651, and porphyromonas gingivalis w83, whose genome databases are freely available, were separated by 2de, and protein spots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) and identified. about 1000 spots from the gels of p. gingivalis w83 were extracted and analyzed by maldi-tof, and 330 proteins were identified. in addition, 160 of 240 spots of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 158 of 356 spots of s. mutans were identified. information such as spot coordinates on the gels, protein names (predicted functions), molecular weights, isoelectroric points, and links to online databases, including oral pathogen sequence databases of the los alamos national laboratory bioscience division (oralgen) and national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) or the institute genomic research (tigr), were stored in tables accessible through the relational database management system mysql on an apache web server. to test for functionality of this database system, responses of s. mutans to environmental changes were analyzed using the database  and 21 spots on the gel were identified as proteins whose expression had been increased or decreased by environmental ph change without in-gel trypsin digestion, protein extraction, or maldi-tof/tof-ms (mass spectrometer) analysis.  the identified proteins are agreement with those reported in previous papers on acid tolerance of s. mutans, demonstrating the usefulness of the system. this database is available at http://www.myamagu.dent.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~bioinformatics/index.html or http://www.bipos.mascat.nihon-u.ac.jp/index.html.

TI  == analysis of the presence of pathogens which predict the risk of disease at peri-implant sites through polymerase chain reaction (pcr).
AB  == the presence of dna of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in the peri-implant sulcus samples of 19 partially edentulous patients was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and related to the depth of the peri-implant sulcus, bleeding on probing, and probable risk of disease. ten of those patients presented a history of periodontal disease and nine of those did not. the dna amplification of these pathogens was observed in seven samples, of which four were from patients without history of periodontal disease. the results suggest that even when significant inflammatory signs are absent the qualitative detection may indicate risk of peri-implantitis, requiring more strict postoperative control.

TI  == caspase activation is involved in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis, a common infectious disease, is initiated by various gram-negative bacteria and characterized by the destruction of the periodontal tissue. here, we investigated the role of caspases, intracellular proteases that are the key mediators of apoptosis. we show that activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 is considerably enhanced in gingival tissue from patients with periodontitis. we also demonstrate in in vitro experiments that various periodontopathic bacteria exert a direct growth-suppressing effect and, moreover, can trigger a host-mediated cytotoxic activity involving the cd95 death receptor. our data suggest that caspase activation is a prominent feature in periodontitis-associated tissue injury.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == analytical epidemiology of periodontitis.
AB  == aims: to review the literature related to the analytical epidemiology of periodontitis generated over the past decade. this review does not deal with descriptive epidemiologic studies of the prevalence, extent and severity of periodontitis with respect to global geography, but focuses exclusively on analytical epidemiology issues, including the challenges posed by the use of different case definitions across studies, current theories and models of disease progression, and risk factors associated with the onset and progression of periodontitis. methods: relevant publications in the english language were identified after medline and pubmed database searches. findings and conclusions:  there is a conspicuous lack of uniformity in the definition of periodontitis used in epidemiologic studies, and findings from different research groups are not readily interpretable. there is a lack of studies that specifically address the distinction between factors responsible for the onset of periodontitis versus those affecting its progression. colonization by specific bacteria at high levels, smoking, and poorly controlled diabetes have been established as risk factors for periodontitis, while a number of putative factors, including specific gene polymorphisms, have been identified in association studies. there is a clear need for longitudinal prospective studies that address hypotheses emerging from the cross-sectional data and include established risk factors as covariates along with new exposures of interest. intervention studies, fulfilling the "targeting"  step of the risk assessment process, are particularly warranted. obvious candidates in this context are studies of the efficacy of elimination of specific bacterial species and of smoking cessation interventions as an alternative to the traditional broad anti-plaque approach in the prevention and control of periodontitis. ideally, such studies should have a randomized-controlled trial design.

TI  == transmission of periodontal bacteria and models of infection.
AB  == background: bacteria play an essential role in the aetiology of periodontitis. most bacterial species isolated from subgingival plaque are indigenous to the oral cavity. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis are detected infrequently in periodontal health, which makes these species prime  candidates to study person-to-person transmission. the aim of the present study was to review the literature on transmission of these periodontal bacterial species. method: we review the literature on bacterial typing techniques and summarize the information on clonal distribution of a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis in family units based on different typing techniques in order to establish the likelihood for person-to-person transmission of these periodontal pathogens. results: vertical transmission of a. actinomycetemcomitans is estimated to be between 30% and 60%, whereas vertical transmission of p. gingivalis has rarely been observed. horizontal transmission between spouses ranges between 14% and 60% for a. actinomycetemcomitans and between 30% and 75% for p. gingivalis. there is some evidence to show that cohabitation with a periodontitis patient influences the periodontal status of the spouse; however, substantially more information is needed to prove this hypothesis. conclusions: transmission of putative periodontal pathogens between family members has been shown. the clinical consequences of these events have been poorly documented. based on the current knowledge, screening for and prevention of transmission of specific virulent clones of a. actinomycetemcomitans may be feasible and effective in preventing some forms of periodontal disease. p. gingivalis is usually recovered from diseased adult subjects, and transmission of this pathogens seems largely restricted to adult individuals. horizontal transmission  of p. gingivalis may therefore be controlled by periodontal treatment involving elimination or significant suppression of the pathogen in diseased individuals and by a high standard of oral hygiene.

TI  == influence of nicotine and cotinine on epithelial colonization by periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: since smoking is an established risk factor for the development of periodontitis, the present study investigated whether nicotine and cotinine can make epithelial cells more prone to colonization by periodontopathogens. methods: primary epithelial cell mono-layers were inoculated with nicotine and cotinine prior to adhesion experiments with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. the number of bacteria associated with cells inoculated or not with nicotine or cotinine were assessed by an indirect culture viability assay. the same experimental set-up was used for assessing hela cells exposed to  cigarette smoke extract (cse). results: primary epithelial cells inoculated with  concentrations of nicotine and cotinine, found in smokers and non smokers, did not show significant differences (p>0.05) in colonization susceptibility to a. actinomycetemcomitans. when these concentrations were increased to 1 mg/ml, a significant (p<0.05) and species-specific effect of the colonization susceptibility of epithelial cells was observed: it increased for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while it decreased for p. gingivalis. for both species the effects were more pronounced for nicotine, although this was not statistically significant. the change in colonization susceptibility did not result from alterations of the bacterial viability due to nicotine or cotinine. treatment of  hela cells with cse also led to a species-specific variation in colonization tendency; i.e., increased for a. actinomycetemcomitans (p<0.05), but not for p. gingivalis. conclusions: the susceptibility of epithelial cells to become colonized by either a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis could be altered by nicotine, cotinine, or cse in a time-dependent, species-specific manner. whether  these findings that support the hypothesis of an increased patient susceptibility for bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells in smokers are clinically relevant remains to be proven.

TI  == differential induction of human beta-defensin expression by periodontal commensals and pathogens in periodontal pocket epithelial cells.
AB  == background: to investigate the possible role of beta-defensins in gingival health and periodontal disease, we examined the effect of several stimuli on the expression of interleukin-8 (il-8), human beta-defensin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (hbd) in primary human diseased gingival epithelial (hge) cell cultures from periodontitis patients by quantitative taqman reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). methods: several strains of the periodontopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were added to the cells, as well as the oral commensal bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli. the induction by the proinflammatory stimuli phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) was also tested. results: in addition to the published observations (pma induces hbd-2 and -4; tnf-alpha induces hbd-2 and -3), it was found that pma can upregulate hbd-1 and hbd-3, whereas tnf-alpha can induce hbd-4. the commensal bacteria were significant inducers of hbd-2, hbd-3, and il-8. the pathogen p. gingivalis induced hbd-1 and hbd-3 at different time points than the commensals,  but no induction of il-8 and hbd-2 could be observed. these data fit with the chemokine paralysis theory. a correlation was found between the pathogenicity of  different serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans and the induction profiles of defensins and il-8. conclusion: the results suggest that a correlation can be found in diseased oral epithelium between the defensin profiles that are induced  and the pathogenicity of the oral bacterial strains.

TI  == the effects of intra-amniotic injection of periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides in sheep.
AB  == objective: periodontal disease may cause several complications of pregnancy, including fetal death. the purpose of this study was to investigate in sheep the  effects of the intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide from 3 periodontopathic organisms and to compare these effects with those resulting from similar injection of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. the outcomes that were  studied included the rates of fetal death and the features of inflammation and lung maturation in survivors. study design: at 118 days of pregnancy, ewes that were bearing single fetuses were allocated at random to receive intra-amniotic injections of saline solution (n = 13 fetuses), or lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis (in doses from 0.1 to 10 mg [n = 22 fetuses]), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 6 fetuses]), fusobacterium nucleatum (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]) or escherichia coli (10 mg [n = 14 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 7 fetuses]). surviving fetuses were delivered  abdominally at 125 days of gestation (term, 150 days). results: when compared with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at similar dosages, periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides had high rates of fetal lethality. only 6 of 22 fetuses that  were exposed to intra-amniotic porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide survived doses of 0.1 to 10 mg, and only 3 of 6 fetuses survived 10-mg actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide. escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide did not cause fetal loss when given at doses of 10 mg (n = 14  fetuses) or 1 mg (n = 7 fetuses). fetuses that survived exposure to these lipopolysaccharides showed features of inflammation in amniotic fluid and cord blood at birth and enhanced lung maturation. conclusion: lipopolysaccharides from these 3 periodontopathic organisms have much higher rates of fetal lethality than escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide but can cause similar intrauterine inflammatory responses and improvements in lung volumes in survivors. sources of  inflammation that are distant from the uterus may underlie a proportion of unexplained stillbirth and other complications of pregnancy.

TI  == genes of periodontopathogens expressed during human disease.
AB  == background: since many bacterial genes are environmentally regulated, the screening for virulence-associated factors using classical genetic and molecular  biology approaches can be biased under laboratory growth conditions of a given pathogen, because the required conditions for expression of many virulence factors may not occur during in vitro growth. thus, technologies have been developed during the past several years to identify genes that are expressed during disease using animal models of human disease. however, animal models are not always truly representative of human disease, and with many pathogens, there  is no appropriate animal model. methods: a new technology, in vivo-induced antigen technology (iviat) was thus engineered and tested in our laboratory to screen for genes of pathogenic organisms induced specifically in humans, without  the use of animal or artificial models of infection. this technology uses pooled  sera from patients to probe for genes expressed exclusively in vivo (or ivi, in vivo-induced genes). iviat was originally designed for the study of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans pathogenesis, but we have now extended it to other oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis. results: one hundred seventy-one thousand (171,000) clones from p. gingivalis strain w83 were screened and 144 were confirmed positive. over 300,000 a. actinomycetemcomitans clones were probed, and 116 were confirmed positive using a quantitative blot assay. conclusion: mat has proven useful in identifying previously unknown in vivo-induced genes that are likely involved in virulence and are thus excellent candidates for use in diagnostic : and therapeutic strategies, including vaccine  design.

TI  == antimicrobial profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in the netherlands and spain.
AB  == background and aim: antimicrobial resistance of periodontal pathogens towards currently used antibiotics in periodontics has been investigated in a previous study. microbial resistance in the periodontal microflora was more frequently observed in spanish patients in comparison with dutch patients. the aim of the present study was to compare antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of five periodontal bacteria isolated from periodontitis patients in spain and in the netherlands. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from adult patients with periodontitis were collected and cultured on selective and non-selective plates. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and micromonas micros were isolated and used for minimal inhibitory concentration tests using the epsilometer (e-test) technique. eight different antibiotics were tested on all bacterial isolates. mic50 and mic90 values for each antibiotic and each species were determined and the percentage of resistant strains was calculated. results:  significantly higher mic values were noted in spanish strains of f. nucleatum for penicillin, ciprofloxacin, of p. intermedia for penicillin, amoxicillin and tetracycline, of m. micros for tetracycline, amoxicillin and azithromycin, and of p. gingivalis for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. based on breakpoint concentrations, a higher number of resistant strains in spain were found in f. nucleatum for penicillin, amoxicillin and metronidazole, in prevotella intermedia for tetracycline and amoxicillin, and in a. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin and azithromycin. resistance of p. gingivalis strains was not observed for any of the antibiotics tested both in spain and the netherlands. conclusions: differences exist in the susceptibility profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in spain and in the netherlands. this implicates that antibiotic susceptibility testing is necessary to determine efficacy of antimicrobial agents. also, clinical studies with antibiotics should  take these differences into account. the information from the present study indicates that it may not be possible to develop uniform protocols for usage of antibiotics in the treatment of severe periodontitis in the european union.

AB  == objectives: previous studies suggest differences between geographically and racially distinct populations in the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria as well as greater periodontal destruction associated with infection by highly leucotoxic actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the present study examined these hypotheses in brazilians with aggressive or chronic periodontitis. materials and  methods: clinical, radiographical, and microbiological assessments were performed on 25 aggressive periodontitis and 178 chronic periodontitis patients including 71 males and 132 females, 15-69 years of age. results: the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis was similar to that of other south american populations. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and its highly leucotoxic subgroup was higher in brazilians. highly leucotoxic a. actinomycetemcomitans was more prevalent in aggressive periodontitis (chi2=27.83) and positively associated with deep pockets (>6 mm, chi2=18.26) and young age (<29 years, chi2=18.68). greater mean attachment loss was found in subjects with highly leucotoxic a. actinomycetemcomitans than in subjects with minimally leucotoxic (p=0.0029) or subjects not infected (p=0.0001). conclusion: these data support the hypothesis of differences between populations in the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria and of greater attachment loss in sites infected with highly leucotoxic a. actinomycetemcomitans. detection of highly leucotoxic a. actinomycetemcomitans in children and adolescents may be a useful marker for aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == association between coinfection of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola and periodontal tissue destruction  in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the association between the infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola in chronic periodontitis (cp) and the severity of periodontal disease remains to be elucidated. the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival infection frequencies of three periodontopathic bacteria in chinese cp patients and to evaluate the correlations between infection by these bacteria and periodontal destruction. methods: a multiple pcr assay using primers derived from 16srdna genes of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola was established to measure simultaneously the presence of the three microbes in 162 subgingival samples from 81 chinese cp patients. results: the positive rates of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the subgingival samples  were 84.6%, 83.3% and 88.3%, respectively. of the subgingival samples, 68% revealed the coinfection of all the three microbes. the infection rates with p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans or t. denticola alone was 5.9% (1/17), 17.6% (3/17) and 76.5% (13/17), respectively. a close association was present between the a. actinomycetemcomitans infection and gingival index (gi) (p < 0.01), but not between p. gingivalis or t. denticola infection and gi (p > 0.05). p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were more frequently detectable in middle and deep pockets than in shallow ones (p < 0.01), while t. denticola was found remarkably often in deep pockets (p < 0.05). the coinfection rate of the three microbes was significantly higher in sites with severe periodontitis than in those with mild periodontitis (p < 0.01). conclusions: the multiple pcr established in this study can be used as a sensitive and specific method to simultaneously detect all three microbes in subgingival samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans infection may be associated with cp and play an important role in the periodontal tissue destruction. the coinfection of p. gingivalis, a.  actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola can cause more serious periodontal destruction than infection of any one or two of the three microbes.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == comparison of culture and real-time pcr for detection and quantification of five  putative periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == objectives: bacterial cultivation is a well-established method for analyzing plaque samples. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a novel rapid method for the identification and quantification of periodontopathogenic bacteria that has been recently introduced. in this study, we compared real-time pcr with conventional anaerobic cultivation. method: a total of 78 subgingival plaque samples were harvested from pockets > or =5 mm in 22 patients with advanced chronic periodontitis and immediately transferred into transport medium. aliquots were evaluated with species-specific probes by real-time pcr (meridol perio diagnostics, gaba) and anaerobic bacteria culture on selective media for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythensis. the  analysis was performed by two separate, blinded examiners. results: when real-time pcr was compared with the culture method (golden standard) for the detection of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria, the sensitivity and specificity for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 67% and 100%, respectively (kappa:  0.79); for f. nucleatum 73% and 53%, respectively (kappa: 0.21); for p. gingivalis 94% and 84%, respectively (kappa: 0.77); for p. intermedia 33% and 94%, respectively (kappa: 0.26) and for t. forsythensis 92% and 56%, respectively (kappa: 0.51). spearman's correlation coefficients for the quantitative results of both methods were 0.82 for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 0.33 for f. nucleatum, 0.83 for p. gingivalis, 0.38 for p. intermedia and 0.67 for t. forsythensis. conclusion: overall, the agreement between both test methods was excellent for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, fair for t. forsythensis and poor for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the discrepancies in the results may be explained by the inability of cultivation methods to distinguish between close related taxa, and the problems of keeping periopathogenic bacteria viable, which is required for standard cultivation.

TI  == predictive value of clinical and microbiological parameters for the treatment outcome of scaling and root planing.
AB  == objectives: to compare the clinical and microbiological outcome of non-surgical periodontal therapy after 6 months with data obtained after hygienic phase or 6 weeks after completion of non-surgical therapy, in order to evaluate the value of clinical and microbiological parameters to predict treatment success. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were available from 271 sites in 10 systemically healthy non-smokers with moderate-to-advanced chronic periodontal disease (24-32 sites per individual). subgingival plaque samples were tested for  the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola using rna probes. results: stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant impact of the number of sites with visible plaque index >1 after hygienic phase on the bleeding tendency of a subject at month 6 (p<0.01). furthermore, an association could be demonstrated between the number of residual pockets (pd>3 mm) 6 months after therapy and the number of bleeding sites and suppurating sites after hygienic phase (p=0.016). six weeks after therapy, the mean total bacterial loads had a significant impact on the bleeding tendency of a subject at month 6 (p<0.01). although the average numbers of sites with persisting p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. forsythensis and t. denticola seemed to be very similar 6 weeks and 6 months after therapy, large variations were noted between subjects, and therefore the microbiological status of a subject at week 6 could not predict the status at month 6. conclusions: the present study showed a limited potential  of microbiological tests, performed after hygienic phase or shortly after non-surgical periodontal therapy, to predict the clinical outcome 6 months later, but confirmed the importance of an establishment of perfect oral hygiene before non-surgical therapy.

TI  == the immunoreactivity of systemic antibodies to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in adult periodontitis.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis secrete several potent virulence factors and are known to be two of the major periodontal pathogens. in the present case-control study, the systemic immunoreactivity to a. actinomycetemcomitans exotoxins, cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) and leukotoxin was analyzed in adult subjects with periodontitis and in periodontally healthy controls. furthermore, systemic immunoreactivity to p. gingivalis was analyzed in these subjects. reactivity to the a. actinomycetemcomitans toxins was determined  in bioassays that quantified neutralizing antibodies, and p. gingivalis antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results showed a significantly enhanced immunoreactivity to p. gingivalis in the  subjects with periodontitis, while the reactivity to a. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin showed no significant difference between patients and controls. however, combined immunoreactivity to leukotoxin and cdt was more prevalent in the subjects with periodontitis than in the controls. in addition, immunoreactivity to leukotoxin correlated to periodontitis in men but not in women. in conclusion, data from the present study indicate that immunoreactivity  to p. gingivalis is frequent in adult periodontitis, while the role of a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be more complex and depends on gender of the infected subject as well as the virulence of the bacteria.

TI  == detection of periodontopathic bacteria and an oxidative stress marker in saliva from periodontitis patients.
AB  == we assessed the salivary levels of periodontopathic bacteria and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) in patients with periodontitis. the salivary levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus) were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. the 8-ohdg levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the salivary levels of 8-ohdg, p. gingivalis,  and t. forsythia in the periodontitis patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. by contrast, the a. actinomycetemcomitans level in healthy subjects was higher than that in periodontitis patients. 8-ohdg was significantly correlated with p. gingivalis. statistically significant decreases  in the levels of p. gingivalis, probing depth, bleeding on probing, and 8-ohdg were observed after initial periodontal treatment. these results suggest that the 8-ohdg levels in saliva reflect the load of periodontal pathogens. 8-ohdg could be a useful biomarker for assessing periodontal status accurately, and for evaluating the efficacy of periodontal treatment.

TI  == [study on the detection of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola and the correlation between coinfections of the microbes and levels of  chronic periodontitis lesion].
AB  == objective: to establish a 16s rdna multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for  simultaneously detecting p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in clinical specimens of chronic periodontitis and to study the correlation between different modes of infection and severity of the disease. methods: periodontal pocket specimens from 152 patients with mild, moderate or advanced chronic periodontitis and gingival sulcus specimens from 30 periodontally healthy individuals were collected and placed in 200 microl lysis buffer. the specimens were incubated in 100 degrees c for 10 min and 10 microl of the supernatant was directly used as pcr template. dnas from p. gingivalis strain atcc33277, a. actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, t. denticola strain fm and e. coli strain dh5alpha were used as positive and negative controls in pcr with all of which were prepared by routing phenol-chloroform method. a multiplex pcr assay, using three sets of primers specific to 16s rdna genes of the three anaerobes, was developed to detect the specimens. the target amplification fragments from 3 cases of pcr products positive for all the three anaerobes were sequenced after t-a cloning. chi-square test was applied to analyze the correlation between different coinfection of the three anaerobes and severity of the disease. results: the established 16s rdna multiplex pcr assay was able to detect p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola at a minimum of 10, 20 and  20 cells, respectively. in comparison with the reported corresponding sequences,  similarities of the nucleotide sequences from the three anaerobes 16s rdna amplification fragments were as high as 99.45%, 97.08% and 96.59%, respectively.  of the 30 periodontally healthy gingival sulcus specimens, only one (3.3%) positive for p. gingivalis and two (6.7%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans could be identified but all of the rest were negative. in the 152 cp periodontal pocket specimens, 147 cases (96.7%) were positive for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and/or t. denticola, respectively, and 5 cases (3.3%) were  negative for all the three anaerobes. the positive rate of p. gingivalis detection (91.5%, 139/152) was significantly higher than those of a. actinomycetemcomitans (72.4%, 110/152) and t. denticola (80.9%, 123/152) (chi(2)  = 7.07, 18.67; p < 0.01). 89.8% of the specimens from patients showed coinfections with two (26.5%) or three anaerobes (63.3%), and the coinfection rates in the specimens from moderate and advanced cp were remarkably higher than  that from mild cp (chi(2) = 10.43, p < 0.01). conclusion: the 16s rdna multiplex  pcr established in this study showed high sensitivity and specificity, which could be used to detect p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola  in clinical specimens. cp was an disease caused by multiple pathogenic microbes while the synergistic pathopoiesis of the three microbes was closely related to the severity of the disease.

TI  == clinical consequences of il-1 genotype on early implant failures in patients under periodontal maintenance.
AB  == background: implant failure and biologic complications such as periimplantitis are not completely avoidable. are there any genetic and microbiologic parameters  that could be used to identify patients at risk for implant failure, preferably prior to treatment? this would result in improvement of the diagnostics, treatment decision, and risk assessment. purpose: the aims of this retrospective  study were to describe (1) the absolute failure rate of branemark system implants (nobel biocare ab, goteborg, sweden) consecutively installed over a 10-year period in partially edentulous patients treated for periodontal disease prior to  implant treatment and under regular professional maintenance, (2) the rate of interleukin-1 (il-1) polymorphism in those patients who experienced at least one  implant failure during the first year of function, and (3) the prevalence of periodontal pathogens in dental and periimplant sites with and without signs of inflammation. material and methods: of 766 patients, 81 encountered at least one  implant failure; 22 patients were clinically examined and were tested genetically for il-1 genotypes. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella nigrescens was analyzed. results: the absolute implant survival rate for the whole population was 95.32%; 10.57% of the patients encountered an implant loss. implant loss in the examined group (n = 22) was 32 of 106 (30.1%); 10 (45%) of the 22 patients were smokers, and 6 (27%) of the 22 patients were il-1 genotype positive. patients positive for il-1 genotype  were not more prone to implant loss; however, a significant synergistic effect with smoking was demonstrated. between patients who were il-1 genotype positive and those who were il-1 genotype negative, the differences in regard to bleeding  on probing or periodontal pathogens did not reach statistical significance. conclusion: the overall implant failure rate in a population treated and maintained for periodontal disease is similar to that of healthy subjects. a synergistic effect found between smoking and a positive il-1 genotype resulted in a significantly higher implant loss. this indicates that further research with a  larger patient group should focus on multifactorial analysis for adequate risk assessment.

TI  == adjunctive antimicrobial therapy of periodontitis: long-term effects on disease progression and oral colonization.
AB  == background: this study assessed the long-term effects of adjunctive antimicrobial therapy on periodontal disease progression and oral colonization. methods: patients with previously untreated chronic periodontitis and subgingival actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and/or porphyromonas gingivalis were randomly assigned to subgingival scaling without (control group) or with systemic amoxicillin plus metronidazole and chx irrigation (test group). relative attachment levels were determined and subgingival and mucosal plaque samples were taken at baseline, at 10 days (plaque only) and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months following initial therapy. during maintenance therapy, patients received supragingival debridement only. results: after 24 months, the 18 test group patients showed at sites with initial probing depths (pd) > or =7 mm a significantly (p <0.05) higher frequency of 2 mm or more attachment gain (37.3% +/- 4.6%) and lower frequency of attachment loss (7.2% +/- 3.1%) compared to the  17 controls (8.2% +/- 3.9% and 19.1% +/- 13.1%, respectively). compared to controls, the intraoral prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (up to 18 months)  and p. gingivalis (up to 3 months) decreased and that of eikenella corrodens (at  10 days) increased in test patients (p <0.05). in both treatment groups, the detection frequency of tannerella forsythensis decreased transiently, while an overall increase was recorded for treponema ssp. conclusions: over the 24-month period, a single course of the administered adjunctive antimicrobial therapy led  to a relative risk reduction of 62% for attachment loss at deep sites. however, with the exception of a. actinomycetemcomitans, it failed to induce long-term changes in the prevalence profiles of oral colonization.

TI  == characteristics of periodontal microflora in acute myocardial infarction.
AB  == background: periodontitis has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. systemic reactions associated with cardiovascular events may depend on  characteristics of the subgingival microflora in periodontitis. our objectives were to compare the numbers of cultivable bacteria, composition of subgingival microflora and clonal distribution of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) in two groups of patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (gcp), one with an acute myocardial infarction (ami-gcp) and the other one without ami (non-ami-gcp). methods: in all, 150 dentate individuals were screened for suitability to this study. subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 11 ami-gcp and 11 non-ami-gcp patients who had been selected using strict inclusion criteria in an attempt to exclude confounding factors and to increase comparability of periodontal conditions by matching for periodontal probing depths and attachment levels. culture methods were used to determine the  total viable counts and occurrence and proportions of six periodontal bacterial species and yeasts. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique was used to detect  a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). intraspecies characterization of a. actinomycetemcomitans included serotyping and genotyping. results: the mean proportions of p. gingivalis (p = 0.05) and tannerella forsythensis (t. forsythensis) (p = 0.01) were significantly lower, but the numbers of micromonas micros (m. micros) and a. actinomycetemcomitans were up to nine times higher and the mean total number of cultivable bacteria per sample higher (p <0.01) in ami-gcp than in non-ami-gcp. conclusion: the findings  that no target subgingival species were overrepresented but the total bacterial number was higher in ami-gcp than non-ami-gcp patients may provide support to the hypothesis that elevated numbers of bacteria in close vicinity to sterile parenteral area present a risk for systemic health.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens in atherosclerotic vessels.
AB  == background: epidemiological studies have shown that periodontitis may be associated with presence of atherosclerosis. dna from periodontal pathogens has been detected in atherosclerotic lesions, but viable oral bacteria have not yet been isolated from atherosclerotic plaques. the purpose of the present study was  to determine if viable oral bacteria could be isolated from atherosclerotic lesions and if dna from periodontal pathogens could be detected by use of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques. methods: seventy-nine specimens of atherosclerotic plaque removed from carotid or femoral arteries during surgery were immediately transferred to reduced transport fluid and brought to the laboratory. the calcified tissue was meticulously cut into fine pieces and used for cultivation of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, and oral streptococci. the material from 24 of the specimens was homogenized, dna was extracted, and pcr amplification of 16s rdna with universal and specific primers was carried out. finally, the pcr products were sequenced. results: none of the samples yielded growth of the oral bacteria  under investigation. in all the 24 specimens bacterial dna was detected and likewise dna of p. intermedia was found in the samples. p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis were found sporadically. conclusions: viable oral bacteria could not be isolated from the atheromas, but the data confirm that dna of periodontal pathogens can be detected in atherosclerotic plaques. however, the finding that dna from p. intermedia constantly occured in the examined samples was new. further studies may focus on the simultaneous occurrence of identical clones of this species in subgingival plaque and atherosclerotic plaques.

TI  == distinct transcriptional profiles characterize oral epithelium-microbiota interactions.
AB  == transcriptional profiling, bioinformatics, statistical and ontology tools were used to uncover and dissect genes and pathways of human gingival epithelial cells that are modulated upon interaction with the periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. consistent with their biological and clinical differences, the common core transcriptional response of  epithelial cells to both organisms was very limited, and organism-specific responses predominated. a large number of differentially regulated genes linked to the p53 apoptotic network were found with both organisms, which was consistent with the pro-apoptotic phenotype observed with a. actinomycetemcomitans and anti-apoptotic phenotype of p. gingivalis. furthermore, with a. actinomycetemcomitans, the induction of apoptosis did not appear to be fas- or tnf(alpha)-mediated. linkage of specific bacterial components to host pathways and networks provided additional insight into the pathogenic process. comparison  of the transcriptional responses of epithelial cells challenged with parental p.  gingivalis or with a mutant of p. gingivalis deficient in production of major fimbriae, which are required for optimal invasion, showed major expression differences that reverberated throughout the host cell transcriptome. in contrast, gene orf859 in a. actinomycetemcomitans, which may play a role in intracellular homeostasis, had a more subtle effect on the transcriptome. these studies help unravel the complex and dynamic interactions between host epithelial cells and endogenous bacteria that can cause opportunistic infections.

AB  == background: aortic aneurysms affect an increasing number of elderly patients and  cause considerable morbidity and mortality. the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms is unclear and little is known about the role of microorganisms in the development of the condition. the aim of  the present study was to examine aortic aneurysm samples for the presence of four putative periodontal pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythensis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: fifty-six samples from the aneurysm wall were obtained from patients undergoing aneurysm repair. dna was extracted from tissue by conventional methods. universal eubacterial primers for general detection of bacteria and species specific primers for detection of the periodontal pathogens were used to amplify part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: bacterial dna was  detected in 50 of the 56 aneurysm samples (89.2%). a. actinomycetemcomitans was found in four samples (7.1%). none of the samples was positive for t. denticola,  t. forsythensis, or p. gingivalis. conclusion: bacteria are commonly present in aortic aneurysms and may play a role in the development of the condition. periodontal pathogens are also present.

TI  == treponema medium glycoconjugate inhibits activation of human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with phenol-water extracts of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == oral treponemes are well-known as causative agents of periodontal diseases; however, the details have not been fully clarified. here, we examined the effects of treponema medium glycoconjugate on the activation of human gingival fibroblasts using phenol-water extracts from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the phenol-water extracts activated human gingival fibroblasts to mediate il-8 production, as well as il-8 mrna expression, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. t. medium glycoconjugate exhibited no activation of human gingival fibroblasts, while phenol-water extract-induced activation of human gingival fibroblasts was clearly inhibited by t. medium glycoconjugate. furthermore, binding of biotinylated phenol-water extracts to cd14 in the presence of lps-binding protein was blocked with t. medium glycoconjugate. these results suggest that t. medium glycoconjugate has an inhibitory effect on host cell activation by periodontopathic bacteria caused by  binding to cd14- and lps-binding protein.

AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the association of locally delivered doxycycline 10% and scaling and root planing in the subgingival plaque of smokers. methods: sixteen smokers with chronic periodontitis and a minimum of four pockets (> or = 5 mm) on anterior teeth that  bled on probing were selected. patients were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: scaling and root planing (srp) or scaling and root planing followed by local application of doxycycline (srp-d). subgingival plaque samples  were collected from initially moderate (5 to 6 mm) and deep (> or = 7 mm) pockets at baseline and 3 months. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis was used to detect the frequency of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas  gingivalis (pg), and tannerella forsythensis (tf). results: no statistically significant difference was found in the reduction of aa in either the srp-d or srp group (p > 0.05). the reduction in tf, pg, and tf + pg was statistically significant for srp-d only (p = 0.016, 0.027, and 0.027, respectively). the proportion of sites free of tf at 3 months was 53% for srp-d and 9% for srp (p =  0.02). for pg, this proportion was 82% and 40%, respectively (p = 0.05). conclusion: the use of locally delivered doxycycline may promote the elimination  of t. forsythensis and p. gingivalis in a greater proportion of sites compared to conventional scaling and root planing in smokers.

TI  == dna-dna hybridization demonstrates multiple bacteria in osteoradionecrosis.
AB  == bone necrosis secondary to radiation was previously attributed to trauma of devitalized bone and microbiological sepsis. however, conventional microbiological technique has failed to demonstrate microorganisms throughout osteoradionecrotic bone, claimed to be hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular. the aim of the present study was to examine such bone for bacteria using dna-dna  hybridization. compared to standard culture methods this technique enables the investigation of a vast number of bacteria in a fairly short time. twelve deep medullary specimens from resected radionecrotic mandibles were studied. a multitude of bacterial species were detected, most of them anaerobic. porphyromonas gingivalis was the most predominant organism, followed by fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum. all samples contained actinomyces, prevotella and f. nucleatum. the results of this study indicate that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, may play a more fundamental role in the pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis than being merely surface contaminants.

AB  == objective: the association between serum antibody levels to major periodontal pathogens and coronary heart disease (chd) was analyzed in a prospective population-based study. methods and results: the population comprised 1023 men (aged 46 to 64 years) in the kuopio ischemic heart disease study. the subjects with chd at baseline (n=113) were more often seropositive for porphyromonas gingivalis iga (38.9% versus 28.5%, p=0.021) and igg (60.2% versus 46.7%, p=0.007) than those without chd. during the 10-year follow-up, 109 men free from  chd at baseline experienced an acute myocardial infarction or chd death. the men  with an end point were more often seropositive for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans iga (15.5% versus 10.2%, p=0.019) than those who remained healthy. in the highest tertile of a. actinomycetemcomitans iga-antibodies compared with the lowest one, the relative risk (rr) for an end point adjusted for chd risk factors was 2.0 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.2 to 3.3). in the porphyromonas gingivalis iga-antibody tertiles, the highest rr of 2.1 (1.3 to 3.4) was observed in the second tertile. all antibody levels correlated positively with the carotid artery intima-media thickness. conclusions: high-serum antibody levels to major periodontal pathogens are associated with subclinical, prevalent, and future incidence of chd. periodontal pathogens or host response against them may contribute to the pathogenesis of chd.

TI  == effects of an antimicrobial additive to toothbrushes on residual periodontal pathogens.
AB  == objective: previous studies have reported the link between residual microbial contamination of toothbrushes and periodontal diseases. the goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of an antimicrobial additive (microban) to toothbrushes on residual retention of periodontal pathogens. methodology: twenty  patients had one side of their mouths brushed with a toothbrush containing the antimicrobial agent (experimental side), and the other side with a toothbrush containing no agent (control). toothbrushes were air-dried (25 degrees c) for four or 24 hours. toothbrush heads were vortexed and cultured for prevotella species (ps), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and non-specific colony-forming units (ns). the plates were incubated and counted. means and standard deviations were calculated, and data were analyzed using a series of t-tests (paired and unpaired) and wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. results: no significant inter- or intra-group differences in mean counts were found; however, when four-hour and 24-hour data for aa, pg, or ns were combined, experimental counts were lower than controls in 39/50 (78%) of  the matched pairs (wilcoxon signed-rank test p = 0.01). conclusion: toothbrushes  containing the antimicrobial additive showed lower microbial counts than those without, but between-group means were not statistically significant.

TI  == detection of dna from periodontal pathogenic bacteria in biofilm obtained from waterlines in dental units.
AB  == direct person-to-person transmission of periodontal bacteria through saliva has recently been widely reported and dental units have been demonstrated to retract  saliva from patients under treatment and to release it into the mouths of subjects undergoing the next operation. in this study the presence of a group of  periodontal pathogenic bacteria inside waterlines in dental units was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based methods. briefly, 18 dental units of three different manufacturers were studied. dental units were divided into two groups according to their prevalent use in routine practice. the first group consisted of nine dental units characterized by the frequent use of high-speed dental hand-pieces directly inside the mouth and in contact with patients' saliva. the second group, as a control, consisted of nine dental units  where high-speed dental hand-pieces were not in use. a one cm section of the waterline tubing connected to the high-speed hand-piece was removed from each dental unit to evaluate the presence of dna of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola. two specimens were positive for prevotella intermedia dna. all the positive results were from samples obtained from dental units categorised in the first group. these findings clearly suggest  that dental units have the potential to transmit periodontal pathogens. manufacturers should be invited to design dental units that incorporate automated devices to disinfect duwls between patients with minimal effort by dental staff.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == high serum antibody levels to porphyromonas gingivalis predict myocardial infarction.
AB  == background: an association between coronary heart disease (chd) and clinically diagnosed periodontitis has been found in several epidemiological studies. however, seroepidemiologic evidence based on prospective data on this association is totally lacking. design: the aim of the study was to investigate serum antibodies to major periodontal pathogens for their prediction of myocardial infarction (mi) in men free of chd at baseline. methods: cases and controls were  ascertained from a random population sample of 4255 men aged 30 to 59 years at baseline. the study cases included 63 men with nonfatal mi or coronary death within the follow-up time of 10 years. age-matched control subjects (n=63) were randomly chosen from the same cohort. serum antibody levels to two major periodontopathogenic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, were determined. results: there was no significant association between the risk for mi and igg- or iga-class antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans or igg-class antibody levels to p. gingivalis. however, a high p. gingivalis iga-class antibody level predicted mi independently of classical cardiovascular risk factors. the risk for mi increased by increasing quartiles of antibody levels (p for the trend 0.021). compared with the first quartile, the multivariate odds ratios of mi in the second, third and fourth quartiles were 2.47 (95% ci 0.75-8.11), 3.30 (1.03-10.58) and 3.99 (1.22-13.10),  respectively. conclusion: the study provides serological evidence that an infection caused by the periodontal pathogen, p. gingivalis, increases the risk for mi.

TI  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis are components of a polymicrobial intracellular flora within human buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we used in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy to detect the periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis within buccal epithelial cells taken directly from the mouth. this study tested the hypothesis that the intracellular  flora of buccal cells is polymicrobial. mixtures containing a red fluorescent universal probe paired with green fluorescent versions of either a. actinomycetemcomitans-, p. gingivalis-, or t. forsythensis-specific probes were hybridized with buccal cells collected from each of 38 healthy humans. we verified co-localization of probe pairs within cells by generating three-dimensional reconstructions. intracellular bacteria were detected in every  subject. each cell that was labeled with a species-specific probe also contained  bacteria recognized only by the universal probe. bacteria labeled with specific probes often occupied smaller regions within larger masses of bacteria. those findings suggest that future studies of invasion by oral bacteria may need to include microbial consortia.

TI  == periodontal diseases: microbiological considerations.
AB  == the location of plaque-associated gingivitis at the gingival portion of the tooth plays an essential role in its genesis. however, at times local and other host response modifying factors also have an influence. the pathogeny of periodontitis is more complex. the microorganisms that comprise subgingival plaque are capable  of acting directly on periodontal tissues or of modifying the host response, whereas the participation of the plaque per se (normal, decreased, or increased)  is as decisive as the action of the bacteria themselves in the emergence of the disease. different types of periodontitis are associated with specific microorganisms. the most periodontopathogenic are a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis. periodontitis as a whole, represent the source of complications such as root caries, endoperiodontal processes and periodontal abscesses. they are associated with various illnesses such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and respiratory infections, amongst others, as well as pathological oral halitosis. the different modalities of pcr are particularly important in the microbiological diagnosis of periodontitis, although on the negative side of things, it must be pointed out that in vitro sensitivity studies cannot be performed using this technique. first line antibiotic treatment of periodontitis  includes amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid, metronidazole (associated or not with amoxicillin) and clindamycin.

TI  == killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria by photodynamic therapy.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate a new approach for killing periodontopathogenic bacteria using photodynamic therapy (pdt). methods: in this  study, we investigated the photosensitizers chlorin e6, blc 1010, and blc 1014 by three different methods for their effect in pdt on the viability of periodontopathogenic bacterial species. the methods included examination of inhibition zones on agar plates, determination of colony-forming units (cfu), and the use of a bacterial viability kit. results: using the cfu method, we were able to demonstrate that the anaerobic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga gingivalis can be photoinactivated completely by illumination with an intensity of 5.3 j/cm2 in the presence of 10 microm chlorin e6 and 10 microm blc 1010. with the photosensitizers chlorin e6 and blc 1010, we were able to induce zones of inhibition on agar plates. blc 1014 failed to produce a zone of inhibition. the results of the bacterial viability test also showed that the photosensitizer blc 1014 provides the lowest photodynamic effect in comparison to the others. conclusion: the data collected to date suggest that photodynamic therapy with chlorin e6 and blc 1010 is advantageous for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == efficacy of antibiotics against periodontopathogenic bacteria within epithelial cells: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: periodontopathogenic bacteria can invade and survive within epithelial cells, but susceptibility of intracellular infection to antibiotics used in periodontitis treatment has not been studied to date. methods: kb cells were infected by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, strain nctc 9710; porphyromonas gingivalis, strains atcc 33277 and jh16-1; or streptococcus constellatus, strain j012b. after 2, 4, and 12 hours the bactericidal effect of antibiotics (clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin) on intracellular microorganisms was tested at a concentration up to the 100-fold minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined separately on planktonic bacteria. results: the p. gingivalis strains differed in their invasiveness and atcc 33277 was 100-fold more invasive than jh16-1. doxycycline and clindamycin at a concentration 10-fold mic had no effect, but p. gingivalis intercellular infection was significantly reduced by metronidazole at 10-fold mic after 2 and 4 hours. moxifloxacin was effective, but a 100-fold mic concentration was necessary to reduce p. gingivalis strains intracellular growth to 7% of the control. other  bacterial species grown inside the kb cells were more susceptible to antibiotics. clindamycin at 10-fold mic reduced the number of intracellular s. constellatus after 4 and 12 hours. this bacterium was eliminated by moxifloxacin at 50-fold mic. intracellular a. actinomycetemcomitans was killed by 10-fold mic of doxycycline and moxifloxacin after 4 hours incubation. conclusions: moxifloxacin  was the most efficient antibiotic to treat intracellular infection. however, taking into account the mic values and the levels of antibiotics in gingival fluid, elimination of intracellular bacteria by antibiotics alone seems to be questionable.

TI  == quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction versus culture: a comparison between two methods for the detection and quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this investigation was to validate a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay in identifying and quantifying actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis from subgingival plaque samples taken from subjects with different periodontal conditions, when compared with conventional cultural procedures. patients and methods: ninety-two adult subjects participated in this study, 32 with periodontitis, 30 with gingivitis and 30 healthy. a pooled subgingival sample was obtained from every patient. culturing procedures were carried out using standard techniques. for real-time pcr analysis, primers were selected from sequences of the lktc (a. actinomycetemcomitans), arg-gingipain (p. gingivalis) and bspa antigen (t. forsythensis) genes. contingency tables were constructed to  compare the qualitative results, while quantitative data were evaluated by paired t-test. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was the least frequently recovered species with both techniques. prevalence of p. gingivalis was low in healthy patients, increased in gingivitis and peaked in periodontitis patients. the frequency of detection of t. forsythensis showed marked differences between culture and pcr, although the same tendency of an increase in prevalence from health to gingivitis and to periodontitis was observed with both methods. contingency tables demonstrated a good level of agreement between pcr and culture procedures for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, especially in periodontitis patients. p. gingivalis culture counts were significantly higher than those obtained by pcr. the opposite was true for t. forsythensis, and statistically significant higher counts were obtained by pcr for gingivitis and periodontitis patients. conclusion: this study demonstrated a good agreement between the quantitative pcr technology and the culture procedure. the high sensitivity and specificity of the quantitative pcr technology justify its use in epidemiological studies and as an adjunct in clinical diagnosis of periodontal patients.

TI  == methods of detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis in periodontal microbiology, with special  emphasis on advanced molecular techniques: a review.
AB  == background: certain specific bacterial species from the subgingival biofilm have  demonstrated aetiological relevance in the initiation and progression of periodontitis. among all the bacteria studied, three have shown the highest association with destructive periodontal diseases: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythensis (tf). therefore, the relevance of having accurate microbiological diagnostic techniques for their identification and quantification is clearly justified. aim: to evaluate critically all scientific information on the currently available microbial diagnostic techniques aimed for the identification  and quantification of aa, pg and tf. summary: bacterial culturing has been the reference diagnostic technique for many years and, in fact, most of our current knowledge on periodontal microbiology derives from cultural data. however, the advent of new microbial diagnostics, mostly based on immune and molecular technologies, has not only highlighted some of the shortcomings of cultural techniques but has also allowed their introduction as easy and available adjunct  diagnostic tools to be used in clinical research and practice. these technologies, mostly polymerase chain reaction (pcr), represent a field of continuous development; however, we still lack the ideal diagnostic to study the  subgingival microflora. qualitative pcr is still hampered by the limited information provided. quantitative pcr is still in development; however, the promising early results reported are still hampered by the high cost and the equipment necessary for the processing. conclusion: quantitative pcr technology may have a major role in the near future as an adjunctive diagnostic tool in both epidemiological and clinical studies in periodontology. however, culture techniques still hold some inherent capabilities, which makes this diagnostic tool the current reference standard in periodontal microbiology.

TI  == mmp-2 activation by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans supernatant in human pdl cells was corresponded with reduction of timp-2.
AB  == objective: matrix metalloproteinase 2 (mmp-2) has been implicated to play a role  in pathogenesis of periodontal disease. we recently reported that porphyromonas gingivalis supernatant could activate mmp-2 in human periodontal ligament (hpdl)  cells. in this study, activation of mmp-2 by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans supernatant and the mechanism was investigated. methods: hpdl cells were treated  with either a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis supernatant for 48 h. to verify the mechanism, pretreated inhibitors were used. gelatin zymography, rt-pcr and western blot analysis were used to detect the activation of mmp-2, expression of mt1-mmp and timp-2 mrna and the proteins, respectively. results: the supernatant from a. actinomycetemcomitans could activate mmp-2 in hpdl cells similar to that from p. gingivalis but by a different mechanism. activation by a. actinomycetemcomitans supernatant was correlated with a reduction of timp-2 secretion without any alteration of mt1-mmp, while activation by p. gingivalis increased mt1-mmp but no change of timp-2 was found. conclusion: the supernatant  from a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis could induce the activation of mmp-2 possibly through the imbalance of mt1-mmp and timp-2 in hpdl cells but by different mechanisms. the imbalance of mt1-mmp and timp-2 may be another factor that is involved in the severity of periodontal disease.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaques. a controlled clinical and laboratory trial.
AB  == objective: a possible relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease has been suggested. the aims of this controlled clinical study were: (i)  to ascertain the presence of periodontal bacteria dna [actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus)]  in carotid atheromatous plaques and (ii) to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna, if any, in periodontal pockets and in carotid  atheroma in the same patient. methods: a total of 52 patients scheduled for carotid endarderectomy were enrolled in this study. the test group consisted of 26 dentate patients; the control group included 26 edentulous patients. a complete periodontal examination, including radiographic orthopanoramic and subgingival plaque sample, was performed in the test population. oral and x-ray examinations were performed in the control group. atheromatous plaques were harvested during surgical procedure for each dentate and edentulous patient and then sent to the microbiological laboratory. subgingival plaque samples and carotid specimens were examined using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique by means of specific primers for periodontal bacteria. amplification of extracted dna was tested using human beta-globin specific-primers. results: out of 52 endarterectomy samples, 12 (seven dentate, five edentulous patients) were excluded as negative to dna amplification. in subgingival plaque samples of 19 test patients, t. forsythensis (79%), f. nucleatum (63%), p. intermedia (53%), p. gingivalis (37%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (5%) were found. no periodontal bacteria dna was detected by pcr in any of the carotid samples in either patient  group. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in atheromatous plaques could not be confirmed by this study and thus no correlation could be established between species associated with periodontal disease and putative bacteria contributing to atheromatous plaques.

AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and tannerella forsythensis have been implicated as the main etiological agents of periodontal disease. the purpose of this work was to estimate the prevalence of these organisms in plaque from children without gingivitis (group 1; n = 65) and from those with gingivitis (group 2; n = 53). extracted dna from plaque was subjected  to two rounds of pcr targeting the 16s rrna gene using both universal primers and species-specific primers. the results were as follows: group 1, p. gingivalis, 49%; a. actinomycetemcomitans, 55%; and t. forsythensis, 65%; group 2, p. gingivalis, 47%; a. actinomycetemcomitans, 59%; and t. forsythensis, 45%. t. forsythensis was detected more frequently in children with no gingivitis than in  those with gingivitis (p = 0.03). there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the presence of p. gingivalis or a. actinomycetemcomitans in either group (p > 0.05). logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of a patient having gingivitis were 2.3 times greater in the absence of t. forsythensis. in conclusion, the results of this study have shown that the three pathogens can be detected in the dental plaque of healthy children and of those with gingivitis and that t. forsythensis is associated with dental plaque at sites with no gingivitis.

AB  == background and purpose: the association between cerebrovascular events and periodontitis has been found in few studies based on clinical periodontal examinations. however, evidence on the association between periodontal pathogens  and stroke is lacking. therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate whether elevated levels of serum antibodies to major periodontal pathogens predict stroke in a case-control study. methods: the study population comprised 6950 subjects (aged 45 to 64 years) who participated in the mobile clinic health survey in 1973 to 1976 in finland. during a follow-up of 13 years, a total of 173 subjects had a stroke. from these, 64 subjects had already experienced a stroke or had signs of  coronary heart disease (chd) at baseline, whereas 109 subjects were apparently healthy. two controls per case were matched for age, gender, municipality, and disease status. serum igg and iga class antibody levels to the periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, were determined by multiserotype enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: the  cases identified during the follow-up that were free of stroke or chd at baseline were more often iga-seropositive for a. actinomycetemcomitans than were their controls, 41.3% versus 29.3%. compared with the seronegative, the seropositive subjects had a multivariate odds ratio of 1.6 (95% ci, 1.0 to 2.6) for stroke. the patients with a history of stroke or chd at baseline were more often iga-seropositive for p. gingivalis than were their controls, 79.7% versus 70.2%.  when compared with the seronegative, the seropositive subjects had an odds ratio  of 2.6 (1.0 to 7.0) for secondary stroke. conclusions: the present prospective study provides serological evidence that an infection caused by major periodontal pathogens is associated with future stroke.

TI  == effect of supragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and gingivo-periodontal tissues.
AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a short term evaluation of the effect of supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microflora and gingivoperiodontal tissues in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis. a total of 92 sites from 23 patients were studied; patients ranged between 35 and 60 years of age (x  46.4 +/- 1.71). plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), bleeding on probing (bp), probing depth (pd), and attachment level (al) were measured. subgingival microflora of the same sites was studied by dark field microscopy, and cultures in non-selective and selective media for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (pi/n), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and  fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). the patients were included in a supragingival plaque control program which included oral hygiene training and assessment, and professional control of supragingival plaque and calculus. after 28 days, measurement of clinical parameters and the microbiological study were repeated. the sites were divided according to baseline pd values into: group 1 (5 mm), group 2 (6 mm) and group 3 (> or = 7 mm). results revealed a significant reduction in pi scores, gi scores, pb and pd in groups 2 and 3. no significant difference in al was observed in any of the three groups. pi scores were found to decrease significantly in group 1, and gi scores, bp and pd tended to decrease. a significant increase in coccoid cells and a significant decrease in motile rods and spirochetes, both small and total, was observed in groups 2 and 3. group 1 showed a significant decrease in medium and total spirochetes. at the end of the  study, a significant decrease in pi/n was found in all three groups. significant  decreases were found in pg and fn in groups 3 and 2 respectively. although it holds true that supragingival plaque control reduced a potentially pathogenic subgingival microbiota, this effect was not sufficient to be compatible with healthy gingivoperiodontal tissues.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial interrelationships in aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: recent findings have begun to provide a basis for a causal link between herpesviruses and aggressive periodontitis. one theory is that herpesviruses cooperate with specific bacteria in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. this study examined whether the presence of herpesviruses [human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv) type 1, herpes simplex virus (hsv) type 1 and 2] is associated with the presence of putative pathogenic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia,  campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in aggressive periodontitis lesions. methods: the study included 18 young adults with advanced  periodontitis and 16 periodontally healthy subjects from ankara, turkey. subgingival specimens pooled from two sites in each subject were collected by a periodontal curette. qualitative polymerase chain reaction methodology was used to identify herpesviruses and bacteria. chi-square tests were employed to determine statistical associations among herpesviruses, bacteria and periodontal  disease. results: hcmv, ebv-1 and hsv-1 were each detected in 72-78% of the aggressive periodontitis patients. hsv-2 occurred in 17% of the periodontitis patients. ebv-1 was detected in one periodontally healthy subject. the study bacteria occurred in 78-83% (p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, c. rectus) and in 44% (p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans) of the periodontitis samples, and in 0-19% of the samples from healthy periodontal sites. hcmv, ebv-1 and hsv-1 were positively associated with p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and c. rectus, but not with a. actinomycetemcomitans. hsv-2 was not associated with any  test bacteria. conclusions: these results support the notion that the clinical outcome of some types of severe periodontal infection depends on the presence of  specific herpesviruses and bacterial pathogens. our findings open the door to testing a variety of hypotheses regarding the deleterious aspects of combined herpesviral-bacterial infections in periodontal sites.

TI  == plasma antibody levels in periodontitis patients and controls.
AB  == background: a major aspect of the adaptive host response in periodontitis is the  production of antibodies. several risk and susceptibility factors for periodontitis, including smoking, age and composition of the subgingival microflora, have also been suggested to influence antibody production. aim: the present study was conducted to investigate plasma levels of immunoglobulin (ig) g, a and m antibodies in periodontitis patients of caucasian european heritage in relation to disease severity, smoking, diagnosis and prevalence of periodontopathogens. methods: in this study, 29 patients with severe periodontitis, 51 with moderate periodontitis and 55 controls without periodontal destruction were enrolled. from the total of 80 patients, 18 were diagnosed with  aggressive periodontitis and 62 with chronic periodontitis. total igg, iga and igm as well as igg isotypes were analyzed in plasma samples. results: levels of total igg, iga and igm were not different between patients and controls; however, in periodontitis, higher levels of igg1 and igg2 were observed. smoking appeared  to be significantly and inversely related to antibody levels in periodontitis, in particular for total igg and igg2. the absence of an elevated total igg and igg2  in smoking patients was irrespective of severity, prevalence of periodontal pathogens and diagnosis. the elevation of total igg and igg1 and igg2 in non-smoker periodontitis patients was observed in patients with moderate periodontitis and even greater in patients with severe periodontitis, but was independent whether patients were infected with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis and independent of diagnosis. clinically, it was observed that patients who smoked had more periodontal bone loss; the current findings on antibody levels may be one of several mechanisms related to more extensive periodontal breakdown in smoker patients. conclusion: the current study shows that non-smoker periodontitis patients have higher levels of total igg and igg2 than smoker periodontitis patients.

TI  == gene expression signatures in chronic and aggressive periodontitis: a pilot study.
AB  == this pilot study examined gene expression signatures in pathological gingival tissues of subjects with chronic or aggressive periodontitis, and explored whether new subclasses of periodontitis can be identified based on gene expression profiles. a total of 14 patients, seven with chronic and seven with aggressive periodontitis, were examined with respect to clinical periodontal status, composition of subgingival bacterial plaque assessed by checkerboard hybridizations, and levels of serum igg antibodies to periodontal bacteria assayed by checkerboard immunoblotting. in addition, at least two pathological pockets/patient were biopsied, processed for rna extraction, amplification and labeling, and used to study gene expression using affymetrix u-133 a arrays. based on a total of 35 microarrays, no significantly different gene expression profiles appeared to emerge between chronic and aggressive periodontitis. however, a de novo grouping of the 14 subjects into two fairly robust clusters was possible based on similarities in gene expression. these two groups had similar clinical periodontal status and subgingival bacterial profiles, but differed significantly with respect to serum igg levels against the important periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and campylobacter rectus. these early data point to the usefulness of gene expression profiling techniques in the identification of subclasses of periodontitis with common pathobiology.

TI  == antibiotic resistance profile of the subgingival microbiota following systemic or local tetracycline therapy.
AB  == background: tetracyclines have been extensively used as adjunctives to conventional periodontal therapy. emergence of resistant strains, however, has been reported. this study evaluated longitudinally the tetracycline resistance patterns of the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis subjects treated with systemic or local tetracycline therapy+scaling and root planing (srp). methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients were randomly assigned to three groups: srp+500 mg of systemic tetracycline twice/day for 14 days; srp alone and srp+tetracycline fibers (actsite) at four selected sites for 10 days. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from four sites with probing pocket depths (ppd)> or =6 mm in each patient at baseline, 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months post-therapy. samples were dispersed and diluted in pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized ringer's solution, plated on trypticase soy agar (tsa)+5% blood with or without 4 microg/ml of tetracycline and incubated anaerobically for 10 days. the percentage of resistant microorganisms were determined and the isolates identified by dna probes and the checkerboard method. significance of differences among and within  groups over time was sought using the kruskal-wallis and friedman tests, respectively. results: the percentage of resistant microorganisms increased significantly at 1 week in the tetracycline groups, but dropped to baseline levels over time. the srp+actsite group presented the lowest proportions of resistant species at 6 and 12 months. no significant changes were observed in the srp group. the predominant tetracycline-resistant species included streptococcus  spp., veillonela parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, gemella morbillorum and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). a high percentage of sites with resistant aa, porphyromonas gingivalis and tanerella forsythensis was observed in all groups at baseline. however, t. forsythensis was not detected in any group and p. gingivalis was not present in the srp+actsite group at 1 year post-therapy. aa was still frequently detected in all groups after therapy. however, the greatest reduction was observed in the srp+actsite group. conclusion: local or systemically administered tetracycline results in transitory selection of subgingival species intrinsically resistant to this drug. although the percentage of sites harboring periodontal pathogens resistant to tetracycline were quite elevated in this population, both therapies were effective in reducing their prevalence over time.

TI  == microbiologic diagnostics at titanium implants.
AB  == background: the microbiota found at periimplant lesions have been shown to contain putative periodontal pathogens as well as opportunistic species such as staphylococcus spp, enterics, and candida spp. therefore, a microbiologic diagnosis may be of value as guidance before treatment of such lesions. purpose:  the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of some putative pathogens associated with long-term followed-up cases using two different microbiologic procedures. materials and methods: fifteen subjects contributed with plaque samples from teeth and implants; these were analyzed with respect to 18 putative  periimplant pathogens using cultural methods and a deoxyribonucleic acid dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: the number of individuals positive for the analyzed pathogens was similar in samples taken from teeth and implants when analyzed with the dna-dna hybridization technique. when comparing detection frequency by culture procedure and by "checkerboard" technique at implants, the number of individuals positive for these species was lower with the traditional culture technique than with the checkerboard analyses. using a higher cutoff point (> or = 4) with the checkerboard technique, the number of positive individuals was generally lower than that found with the culture technique. when  comparing the techniques on an implant site level, the prevalence obtained by culture was lower for all analyzed species. if the specific species were present  in the samples analyzed by the checkerboard technique, they were present only in  every second sample analyzed with the culture technique. the high specificity values showed that if the checkerboard technique did not detect any porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, or fusobacterium nucleatum, the bacteria were also undetectable by the culture technique. the two methods therefore did not overlap but did supplement each other. conclusions: based on the current results it is recommended that the technique used when analyzing microbiota around titanium implants should be a combination of the two protocols mentioned as they seem to give the most comprehensive outcome when used together.

TI  == human salivary function in relation to the prevalence of tannerella forsythensis  and other periodontal pathogens in early supragingival biofilm.
AB  == objective: previously, we screened 149 subjects and established four groups high  or low for salivary killing of oral bacteria, and for aggregation and live and dead adherence of oral bacteria (as a combined factor). caries scores were significantly lower in both high aggregation-adherence groups. subsequently, we found that supragingival total biofilm dna, total streptococci and two major streptococcal rrna variants also were significantly lower in the high aggregation-adherence groups. in this study, we looked at the effects of those differences in salivary function on three periodontal pathogens. design: quantitative pcr was used to determine levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus) in stored dna extracts of overnight supragingival biofilm collected from buccal upper central incisors (uc), lingual  lower central incisors (lc) and buccal upper and lower first molars (bm) and lingual upper and lower first molars (lm) of subjects in the four groups. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were almost completely absent from these samples. t. forsythensis was found in 11 of 35 persons at the buccal molar site. only two of those subjects were in the high aggregation-adherence groups, and that difference was statistically significant. the mean quantity of t. forsythensis also was significantly lower in the high aggregation-adherence groups. conclusions: the difference between the low and high aggregation-adherence groups might reflect direct interactions of salivary proteins with t. forsythensis. alternatively, the higher levels of total biofilm  and total streptococci seen in the low aggregation-adherence groups might create  a favourable environment for early secondary colonization of t. forsythensis.

TI  == induction of calprotectin release by porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  in human neutrophils.
AB  == calprotectin, a major cytosolic protein of leukocytes, is detected in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells. this protein is known to be a marker for several inflammatory diseases and is detected in inflammatory  gingival tissue with periodontal disease. recently, we found that the calprotectin level in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects. however, the regulation of calprotectin in periodontal disease is unclear. in the present study, we investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathic bacteria on calprotectin release from human neutrophils. neutrophils from healthy donors were treated with lipopolysaccharides from porphyromonas gingivalis (p-lps), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and escherichia coli. calprotectin of neutrophil was identified by immunoblotting and calprotectin amount was determined by elisa. two subunits (10  and 14 kda) of calprotectin were observed in the cell and medium fractions from neutrophils. p-lps increased calprotectin release from seven to 16 times the control level after 30 min and its effect appeared in a dose-dependent manner (10-1000 ng/ml). lipopolysaccharides from a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced calprotectin release from neutrophils. these results suggest that lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria induce calprotectin release from human neutrophils.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain  reaction with taqman probes.
AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.

TI  == efficacy of antibiotics to strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria within a single species biofilm - an in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: this study examined differences in the efficacy of antibiotics against a single strain of three periodontal pathogens grown in an artificial biofilm. methods: single species biofilms were established with artificial saliva and one of the following bacterial strains: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  y4, streptococcus constellatus 384b (a clinical isolate) and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277. the efficacy of the antibiotics clindamycin, doxycycline,  metronidazole, and moxifloxacin to these bacteria was determined using concentrations up to 100-fold minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to planctonic bacteria over 48 h. results: the ability of the bacteria to form a biofilm varied. the biofilms of s. constellatus 384b and a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 contained more viable bacteria and showed a larger thickness in sem photographs than those of p. gingivalis atcc 33277. the antibiotics tested showed different efficacy for the different strains. moxifloxacin was the most efficient antibiotic: onefold mic was sufficient to eliminate a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and p. gingivalis atcc 33277 after 48 h. however, only the 50-fold mic completely eradicated s. constellatus 384b. sem photographs underlined the damaging effect of moxifloxacin on the biofilm structure. conclusion: the complete removal of bacteria by the use of antibiotics alone seems to be impossible when taking into  account mic values and the level of antibiotics in gingival fluid.

TI  == quadrant root planing versus same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological findings.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that over a period of 6 months, same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) resulted in greater reductions in the detection frequency of five putative periodontal pathogens compared with quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) in chronic periodontitis patients. materials and methods: forty patients were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups. the fm-srp group received full-mouth scaling and root planing completed within the same day, while the q-srp group received quadrant root planing at 2-weekly intervals over four consecutive sessions. selected-site analyses were performed on the deepest site in each quadrant before and after therapy, at approximately 3 and 6 months from baseline (r1 and r2) and clinical indices were recorded with an electronic pressure-sensitive probe. in addition, subgingival plaque samples were collected  from these sites at baseline (bas), at reassessment 1 (r1), approximately 6 weeks after the completion of therapy and at reassessment 2 (r2), 6 months from baseline. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in plaque. results: both therapies resulted in significant improvements in all clinical indices both  at r1 and r2. a marked reduction in the presence of all candidate periodontal pathogens was noted after both treatment modalities, reaching statistical significance for the majority of the test organisms. these improvements were maintained over a period of 6 months. when the two treatment groups were compared, a significantly higher percentage of q-srp patients was positive for p. intermedia at r1 compared with fm-srp patients (p<0.05). in addition, a greater reduction in the patient prevalence for t. denticola was found for the fm-srp group than the q-srp group at r1 and r2 from baseline (p<0.005), but the significance of this is questionable given the skewed detection frequency of this organism at baseline between the two treatments (p<0.01). conclusion: this study  failed to confirm that same-day fm-srp resulted in greater microbiological improvements compared with q-srp at 2-weekly intervals over a 6-month period, as  determined by pcr.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) and quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) resulted in variations in the systemic humoral immune response dynamics (antibody titres and avidity) during active treatment and 3 and 6 months post-therapy. materials and methods: forty patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups and received either scaling and root planing quadrant by quadrant at 2-weekly intervals (q-srp group) or same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp group). clinical measurements and serum samples were obtained at baseline and approximately 6 weeks after the last clinical intervention (r1) and 6 months after the initiation of therapy (r2). furthermore, serum samples were obtained from each patient undergoing therapy (q-srp and fm-srp) at 3 bi-weekly instances so as to determine the short-term effects of each session of scaling and root planing on the dynamics of the humoral immune response. serum antibody titre was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and antibody avidity was measured by thiocyanate dissociation against five putative periodontal pathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis; actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; prevotella intermedia; treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus. results: both therapies resulted in similar antibody titre reductions against the majority of the organisms tested and although there was a distinct trend for antibody avidity to increase following therapy, this was not found to be statistically significant, reflecting marked inter-individual variation. in addition, no evidence emerged from this study to support increased antibody titres following the active phases of both treatment approaches due to an inoculation effect. nevertheless, significant short-term increases in antibody avidity to most test bacteria were noted for both treatment strategies. conclusion: both therapies were associated with a reduction in antibody titres and an increase in the binding ability or avidity of antibodies, but there was a marked inter-subject variability and statistical significance was reached for only some of the test bacteria. no significant differences in the humoral antibody dynamics were found  between the two treatment approaches.

TI  == topical and systemic antibiotics in the management of periodontal diseases.
AB  == both systemic and topical antibiotics are increasingly used in the management of  periodontal infections. whilst these drugs are used mostly on an empirical basis, some contend that rational use of antibiotics should be the norm due to their wide abuse and consequential global emergence of antibiotic resistance organisms. here we review the rationale and principles of antimicrobial therapy, treatment goals, drug delivery routes and various antibiotics that are used in the management of periodontal diseases. the pros and cons of systemic and local antibiotic therapy are described together with practical guidelines for their delivery. the available data indicate, in general, that mechanical periodontal treatment alone is adequate to ameliorate or resolve the clinical condition in most cases, but adjunctive antimicrobial agents, delivered either locally or systemically, can enhance the effect of therapy in specific situations. this is particularly true for aggressive (early onset) periodontitis, in patients with generalised systemic disease that may affect host resistance and in case of poor  response to conventional mechanical therapy. locally delivered antibiotics together with mechanical debridement are indicated for non-responding sites of focal infection or in localised recurrent disease. after resolution of the periodontal infection, the patient should be placed on an individually tailored maintenance care programme. optimal plaque control by the patient is of paramount importance for a favourable clinical and microbiological response to any form of  periodontal therapy.

TI  == evidence for local production of antibodies to auto and non-self antigens in periodontal disease.
AB  == autoimmune mechanisms may contribute to periodontal disease (pd) pathogenesis; autoantibody to collagen type 1 is produced at the periodontal site and local levels are found to be higher than in serum. objectives: to find any evidence of  autoimmune destruction in diseased periodontal tissues in patients with periodontitis. the study examines the relationship of antibodies to a self antigen collagen type 1 and antigens from two periodontal pathogens namely porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and a non-oral bacterium bacteroides fragilis (bf) in disease sites and in serum. materials and methods: granulomatous tissues from periodontally diseased sites and serum samples were obtained from 13 patients (15 sites) undergoing surgical therapy. tissues were homogenized at 4 degrees c on tris saline buffer [1 g (5 ml)-1], homogenate was centrifuged and the resultant supernatants were used in assays. antibody to collagen and aa, pg and bf in tissue eluates and serum were determined by competitive enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (elisa) and conventional elisa respectively using an alkaline phosphatase/p-nitrophenyl phosphate enzyme-substrate system. sera from age and sex matched healthy subjects and pooled human serum were used as controls. antibody (ab) levels in tissues and serum were standardized by concomitant albumin assay. results: level of antibodies to collagen type 1 in tissue was significantly higher than in serum (p = 0.0001). antibody levels in tissue to pg were significantly higher than in serum (p = 0.0271). ab levels to both aa and bf in tissues and serum were not significantly different from each other. conclusions: these findings confirm the  process of the local production of antibodies to autoantigen namely collagen type-1 and to bacterial antigens in the granulomatous tissues housed within the periodontal lesions in patients with periodontitis.

AB  == severe periodontitis is associated with elevated inflammatory markers in otherwise healthy populations. however, the nature of this association has not been determined. our aim was to assess whether the degree of response to periodontal therapy was associated with changes in serological markers of systemic inflammation. ninety-four systemically healthy subjects with severe generalized periodontitis participated in a prospective six-month blind intervention trial. periodontal parameters and inflammatory markers [c-reactive protein (crp) and interleukin-6 (il-6)] were evaluated prior to and 2 and 6 mos after delivery of standard non-surgical periodontal therapy. six months after treatment, significant reductions in serum il-6 (p < 0.001, median decrease 0.2 ng/l, 95% ci 0.1-0.4 ng/l) and crp (p < 0.0001, median decrease 0.5 mg/l, 95% ci  0.4-0.7) were observed. decreases in inflammatory markers were significant in subjects with above average clinical response to periodontal therapy after correction for possible confounders. periodontitis may add to the systemic inflammatory burden of affected individuals.

AB  == objectives: detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. we thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. methods: autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel,  subgingival calculus, and root caries. periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. results: subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. the calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655  nm. the autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. however, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or  blood clots. for clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. conclusion: the autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting  subgingival calculus and root caries.

TI  == a comparison of the antibacterial efficacies of essential oils against oral pathogens.
AB  == cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathic bacteria are present in dental plaque as biofilms. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of essential oils on the following oral bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. we tested manuka oil, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavandula oil, and romarinus oil and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. the essential oils inhibited the growth of the bacteria tested, manuka oil being the most effective. minimum bactericidal concentration values showed that lavandula oil acts bacteriostatically, and the remaining oils, bactericidally. periodontopathic bacterial strains tested were killed completely by exposure for 30 s to 0.2% manuka oil, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. tea tree oil and manuka oil showed significant adhesion-inhibiting activity against p. gingivalis. all the essential oils tested inhibited the adhesion of s. mutans. this study showed that, among the essential oils tested, manuka oil and tea tree oil in particular had strong antibacterial activity against periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria. from the viewpoint of safety, we also examined the effects of these essential oils on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that, at a concentration of 0.2%, they had little effect on cultured cells.

TI  == [the effect of stress on periodontitis model of guinea pigs].
AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of stress on guinea pigs' periodontitis model. methods: 24 periodontitis models of guinea pigs were provided by inoculating actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) in the gingival sulcus. the guinea pigs were divided into two groups: stress group(stimulated with cold bath and fright) and control group(without stimulations). three animals of each group were sacrificed successively at 1, 2, 4, 6 week after inoculation. clinical and histological evaluation, cortisol concentration examinations, osteoclast and osteoblast numbers account were applied. results: the cortisol concentration of stress group was significantly higher than that of control group at 1, 2, 4 week after stressed(p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). pocket depth in stress group was significantly deeper than that in control group at 2, 4 week (p < 0.05), compared with control  group, the stress group demonstrated more active tissue damage and alveolar bone  resorption. the bone repair in stress group was not as active as in control group. the osteoclast numbers in stress group was significantly higher than that  in control group at 1, 4, 6 week (p < 0.05). conclusions: stress could enhance the destruction of periodontal tissues infected by pathogenic bacteria and increase disease susceptibility. it was concluded that stress was a significant risk indicator for periodontitis.

TI  == oral microbial heat-shock proteins and their potential contributions to infections.
AB  == the oral cavity is a complex ecosystem in which several hundred microbial species normally cohabit harmoniously. however, under certain special conditions, the growth of some micro-organisms with a pathogenic potential is promoted, leading to infections such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and stomatitis. the physiology and pathogenic properties of micro-organisms are influenced by modifications in environmental conditions that lead to the synthesis of specific  proteins known as the heat-shock proteins (hsps). hsps are families of highly conserved proteins whose main role is to allow micro-organisms to survive under stress conditions. hsps act as molecular chaperones in the assembly and folding of proteins, and as proteases when damaged or toxic proteins have to be degraded. several pathological functions have been associated with these proteins. many hsps of oral micro-organisms, particularly periodontopathogens, have been identified, and some of their properties-including location, cytotoxicity, and amino acid sequence homology with other hsps-have been reported. since these proteins are immunodominant antigens in many human pathogens, studies have recently focused on the potential contributions of hsps to oral diseases. the cytotoxicity of some bacterial hsps may contribute to tissue destruction, whereas the presence of common epitopes in host proteins and microbial hsps may lead to autoimmune responses. here, we review the current knowledge regarding hsps produced by oral micro-organisms and discuss their possible contributions to the  pathogenesis of oral infections.

TI  == associations of periodontal status with general health conditions and serum antibody titers for porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present study was to evaluate associations of periodontal status with general health conditions and with serum antibody titers  for porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) in a japanese population. methods: subjects (1,314) aged 40 years or older were recruited for the study. their periodontal status was evaluated using the community periodontal index of treatment needs (cpitn). records from general health examinations were used for the present analyses, including data on age, gender, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sbp/dbp); levels  of serum alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose, and c-reactive protein (crp); counts of white blood cells (wbc) and platelets; smoking habit; and electrocardiogram recordings. serum igg antibody titers for pg fimbrial antigens  (igg.pg.fim.), pg whole-cell antigens (igg.pg.whol.), and aa whole-cell antigens  (igg.aa.whol.) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the subjects were divided, according to their maximum cpitn codes, into four periodontal groups: max.cpitn-0/1/2, -3, -4, or -ms (missing sextant). results: multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed significant associations of the max.cpitn-4 subjects who were males (odds ratio, or: 2.03) or smokers (or: 1.73), or who had high diastolic blood pressure (or: 1.27), high wbc (or: 1.24),  high serum crp level (or: 2.39) and high serum igg.pg.fim. (or: 1.17), igg.pg.whol. (or:1.54), and igg.aa.whol. (or: 1.19) titers. conclusion: significant associations between periodontal status and several health conditions were found in the adult population examined, including gender, smoking habit, diastolic blood pressure, white blood cell counts, c-reactive protein, and serum  igg antibodies to p. gingivalis fimbriae, igg p. gingivalis whole cell, and igg a. actinomycetemcomitans whole cell titers.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a japanese population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis. other periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis, although the evidence is controversial. the aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria and to clarify the microbiological features of aggressive periodontitis in japanese patients. methods: subgingival plaque was collected from 50 aggressive periodontitis (agp) patients (localized 10, generalized 40). samples from 35 generalized chronic periodontitis (cp) patients and 18 healthy subjects were examined as controls. plaque samples were examined using culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. results: the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans  was relatively low in the localized (20%) and generalized (17.5%) agp patients, with no significant difference observed in detection frequencies between agp and  the control groups (cp 8.6%, healthy 0%). on the other hand, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, and treponema denticola were frequently detected in localized as well as generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. the prevalence and proportion of p. gingivalis correlated with severity of clinical attachment loss in both localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis. conclusions: t. forsythensis, c. rectus, p. gingivalis, and t. denticola were the predominant periodontopathic  bacteria of aggressive periodontitis patients in japan. although a. actinomycetem- comitans was also detected in agp patients, the prevalence of this bacterium was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == distribution of periodontal pathogens in korean aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: microbial associations in aggressive periodontitis versus different ethnic origins are substantially unknown. we undertook this study to determine the prevalence of seven putative periodontopathogens in korean patients and to evaluate microbial differences in localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. methods: thirty-nine aggressive periodontitis patients between 20 and 35 years old (24 males and 15 females; mean age 29.6 years) were selected according to clinical criteria. the patients were subclassified into 17  localized and 22 generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. in each of the 39 individuals, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four diseased teeth (> or = 6 mm probing depth, 156 sites) and one healthy site (< or = 3 mm probing  depth, 39 sites). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of the 16s ribosomal rna gene fragments (about 530 bp) of plaque bacteria and their subsequent detection by dot-blot hybridization using specific oligonucleotide probes were performed to determine the presence of seven periodontopathogens. results: the prevalences were 75% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 94.2% for tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), 99.4% for fusobacterium sp., 85.9% for micromonas micros (formerly peptostreptococcus micros), 96.8% for porphyromonas gingivalis, 78.8% for prevotella intermedia, and 96.8% for treponema sp. the prevalences of these bacteria were significantly higher in diseased sites than in healthy sites. logistic regression analysis showed that p. intermedia was more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis than the localized form, with an odds ratio of 3.28 (95% confidence interval 1.26-8.56, p = 0.015). conclusions: our results demonstrate that the seven periodontal pathogens analyzed are strongly associated with korean aggressive periodontitis. in particular, p. intermedia are more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis, a more severe and progressive form, than with localized aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr using taqman and sybr green for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tetq gene and total bacteria.
AB  == accurate quantification of bacterial species in dental plaque is needed for microbiological diagnosis of periodontal diseases. the present study was designed to assess the sensitivity, specificity and quantitativity of the real-time pcr using the geneamp sequence detection system with two fluorescence chemistries. taqman probe with reporter and quencher dye, and sybr green dye were used for sources of the fluorescence. primers and probes were designed for actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and total  bacteria based on the nucleotide sequences of the respective 16s ribosomal rna genes. since spread of antibiotic resistance genes is one of the crucial problems in periodontal therapy, quantitative detection of tetq gene, which confers resistance to tetracycline, was included in the examination. the detection of p.  gingivalis, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans was linear over a range of 10-10(7) cells (10-10(7) copies for tetq gene), while the quantitative range for  total bacteria was 10(2)-10(7) cells. species-specific amplifications were observed for the three periodontal bacteria, and there was no significant difference between the taqman and sybr green chemistry in their specificity, quantitativity and sensitivity. the sybr green assay, which was simpler than taqman assay in its manipulations, was applied to the clinical plaque samples. the plaque samples were obtained from eight patients (eight periodontal pockets)  before and 1 week after the local drug delivery of minocycline. although the number of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans markedly decreased after the antibiotic therapy in most cases, higher copy numbers of the  tetq gene were detectable. the real-time pcr demonstrated sufficient sensitivity, specificity and quantitativity to be a powerful tool for microbiological examination in periodontal disease, and the quantitative monitoring of antibiotic resistance gene accompanied with the antibiotic therapy should be included in the examination.

TI  == intracellular production and extracellular release of oxygen radicals by pmns and oxidative stress on pmns during phagocytosis of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == in this study we investigated intracellular and extracellular oxygen radical production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) during the phagocytosis of periodontopathic bacteria. in in vitro assays, bacteria of the species porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum were phagocytosed at 37 degrees c for 4 h by purified peripheral human  pmns from healthy subjects (n = 6). superoxide production during phagocytosis was determined by flow cytometry and with a fluorescence/luminescence microplate reader. after phagocytosis, oxidative stress was determined by flow cytometry. both the intracellular and extracellular oxygen radical production by pmns phagocytosing f. nucleatum was significantly greater than that of pmns phagocytosing p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans ( p < 0.01 by the mann-whitney test). moreover, after 4 h of incubation, the oxidative stress of pmns phagocytosing f. nucleatum was significantly greater than that of pmns phagocytosing p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. we conclude that a high level of superoxide production by pmns may damage not only periodontopathic bacteria but also pmns themselves, and may be correlated with the destruction of  periodontal tissue.

TI  == antimicrobials for the treatment of aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aggressive periodontitis is characterized by a considerable attachment loss over  a relatively short period of time. it may be the consequence of either the presence of highly aggressive pathogens or a highly susceptible host. in the first case, the use of antimicrobials should be beneficial in the treatment of those patients. however, due to the organization of the micro-organisms as a biofilm, the increasing incidence of allergies and resistance against antimicrobials and their side-effects, there is still controversy about their benefit in the treatment of periodontal disease. this paper discusses indications for the use of antimicrobials, the substances prescribed and the type of application under the conditions of aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == periodontitis is associated with a low concentration of vitamin c in plasma.
AB  == this study aimed to clarify how concentrations of vitamin c in plasma relate to the serology of periodontitis. the random sample used comprised 431 men, 194 from finland and 237 from russia. the plasma vitamin c concentration was determined by o-phtaldialdehyde-fluorometry, and serum immunoglobulin g antibodies to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were determined by a multiserotype enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the mean plasma vitamin c concentration was higher (p < 0.001) in finnish subjects (mean +/- standard deviation, 4.5 +/- 2.8 mg/liter) than in russian subjects (1.4 +/- 1.8 mg/liter). mean antibody levels to both a. actinomycetemcomitans (4.7 +/- 3.6 versus 5.2 +/- 3.1 elisa units [p = 0.05]) and p. gingivalis (5.7 +/- 2.5 versus  7.6 +/- 2.9 elisa units [p < 0.001]) were lower in finnish men than in russian men. in the combined finnish and russian population, the antibody levels to p. gingivalis were negatively correlated with vitamin c concentrations (r = -0.22; p < 0.001); this association remained statistically significant (p = 0.010) in a linear regression model after adjustment for confounding factors. the proportion  of p. gingivalis-seropositive subjects decreased with increasing vitamin c concentrations (p for trend, <0.01), but no trend was seen among a. actinomycetemcomitans-seropositive subjects. in conclusion, p. gingivalis infection is associated with low concentrations of vitamin c in plasma, which may increase colonization of p. gingivalis or disturb the healing of the infected periodontium.

TI  == multifactorial assessment of predictors for prevention of periodontal disease progression.
AB  == univariate approaches have identified single factors influencing periodontal disease progression. the aim of this explorative approach was to assess the influence of various predictive factors responsible for the prevention of periodontal disease progression in the same patient sample. patients with untreated chronic periodontitis underwent subgingival debridement alone or in combination with adjunctive antimicrobial therapy (systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole/7 days plus supragingival chx irrigation). supportive periodontal therapy was performed over a 24-month period. as predictors, clinical, microbial, immunological, and genetic parameters were assessed. the primary outcome variable was the percentage of teeth without attachment loss >/=2 mm over the study period (stability of attachment). at 24 months, multiple regression analysis identified  adjunctive antimicrobial therapy for teeth with initially at least one site showing a pocket probing depth of >/=7 mm and igg(4) reactivity against a 110-kda protein of a. actinomycetemcomitans at teeth with initial pocket probing depths </=6 mm as main predictors of long-term attachment stability ( p<0.05). other parameters failed to influence treatment outcome. adjunctive antimicrobial therapy and antibody reactivity may be dominant factors influencing the prevention of attachment loss in patients receiving periodontal therapy.

TI  == endpoint quantitative pcr assays for bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for periodontal pathogens are so sensitive that they detect infections of no clinical significance. quantitative pcr (qpcr) may provide a solution to this problem. however, most qpcr systems require expensive real-time thermal cyclers. objective: our goal was to develop qpcr assays which would allow endpoint quantification. materials and methods: 16s rrna primers for bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were adapted to the amplifluor qpcr system, which incorporates fluorescein into the pcr product so that endpoint fluorescence is proportional to the original amount of template. dna dilutions representing known numbers of cells were used as standard curves. pooled subgingival plaques from the four deepest pockets of 21 severe adult periodontitis patients were assayed. buccal molar supragingival plaque from 35 dental students provided healthy controls. endpoint fluorescence was measured with a microplate reader. results: optimized standard curves were linear in log-log or semilog fits over a range of 100-10(6) cells. countable b. forsythus was present in all patients, with counts (as logs) from 2.4 to 7.3 (mean = 5.0), and 11 controls with counts from 2.1 to 4.5 (mean = 3.0). p. gingivalis was present in 11 patients and no controls, with counts from 2.2 to 4.7 (mean = 3.2). a. actinomycetemcomitans was present in two patients, with counts of 1.5 and 3.5. conclusions: amplifluor qpcr assays discriminated between  plaque samples differing by one log or more, allowing major infections to be distinguished from minor ones. this approach allows high-throughput qpcr of plaque samples, using equipment available to many laboratories.

AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == subgingival microflora in turkish patients with periodontitis.
AB  == background: no information exists on periodontitis-associated subgingival microbiota from turkey. we determined the occurrence, interspecies relationships, and clonal characteristics for a group of periodontal bacteria in a turkish study population. methods: subgingival microbial samples were obtained from patients with localized (lagp, n = 18) or generalized (gagp, n = 17) types of aggressive periodontitis, generalized chronic periodontitis (gcp, n = 14), and non-periodontitis subjects (n = 20). culture methods were used to recover 6 periodontal bacterial species and yeasts, and a polymerase chain reaction technique was used to detect actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. intraspecies characterization of a. actinomycetemcomitans was carried out by serotyping and genotyping. results: all  species, except for micromonas micros (formerly peptostreptococcus micros) occurred more frequently (p < 0.05) in periodontitis than non-periodontitis subjects. detection frequencies for tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus) and campylobacter rectus differed among the periodontitis subgroups; the lowest frequency occurred in lagp. the mean proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and c. rectus were higher (p < 0.008) in gagp than in non-periodontitis subjects. significant positive associations were seen between 7 of the 22 possible combinations (p < 0.05). a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype c (34%) and non-serotypeable isolates (34%) were the most common antigenic types among the 305 strains analyzed. eleven arbitrarily primed (ap)-pcr genotypes were distinguished among 273 isolates from  29 subjects. yeasts were found in 23% of the 69 subjects. conclusions: the results on the turkish study population were generally in line with earlier reports on the occurrence and interspecies relationships of certain bacteria in periodontitis. however, a. actinomycetemcomitans was not overrepresented in lagp, and the serotype distribution resembled that reported from the east. the high frequency of non-serotypeable isolates suggests local characteristics of the species.

TI  == application of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to the analysis of  microbial communities of subgingival plaque.
AB  == objectives: denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was applied to the microbiologic examination of subgingival plaque. materials and methods: the pcr primers were designed from conserved nucleotide sequences on 16s ribosomal rna gene (16srdna) with gc rich clamp at the 5'-end. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  was performed using the primers and genomic dnas of typical periodontal bacteria. the generated 16srdna fragments were separated by denaturing gel. results: although the sizes of the amplified dna fragments were almost the same among the  species, 16srdnas of the periodontal bacteria were distinguished according to their specific sequences. the microflora of clinical plaque samples were profiled by the pcr-dgge method, and the dominant 16srdna bands were cloned and sequenced. simultaneously, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were detected by an ordinary pcr method. in the deep periodontal pockets, the bacterial community structures were complicated and p. gingivalis was the most dominant species, whereas the dgge profiles were simple and streptococcus or neisseria species were dominant in the shallow pockets. the  species-specific pcr method revealed the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the clinical samples. however, corresponding bands were not always observed in the dgge profiles, indicating a lower sensitivity of the dgge method. conclusion: although the dgge method may have a lower sensitivity than the ordinary pcr methods, it could visualize the bacterial qualitative compositions and reveal the major species of the plaque. the dgge analysis and following sequencing may have the potential to be a promising bacterial examination procedure in periodontal diseases.

AB  == background: the ability of helium-neon (he-ne) laser irradiation of a photosensitizer to induce localized phototoxic effects that kill periodontal pathogens is well documented and is termed photodynamic therapy (pdt). objectives: we investigated the potential of a conventional light source (red-filtered xenon lamp) to activate toluidine blue o (tbo) in vitro and determined in vitro model parameters that may be used in future in vivo trials. materials and methods: porphyromonas gingivalis 381 was used as the primary test  bacterium. results: treatment with a 2.2 j/cm2 light dose and 50 micro g/ml tbo concentration resulted in a bacterial kill of 2.43 +/- 0.39 logs with the he-ne laser control and 3.34 +/- 0.24 logs with the lamp, a near 10-fold increase (p =  0.028). increases in light intensity produced significantly higher killing (p = 0.012) that plateaued at 25 mw/cm2. there was a linear relationship between light dose and bacterial killing (r2 = 0.916); as light dose was increased bacterial survival decreased. no such relationship was found for the drug concentrations tested. addition of serum or blood at 50% v/v to the p. gingivalis suspension prior to irradiation diminished killing from approximately 5 logs to 3 logs at 10 j/cm2. when serum was washed off, killing returned to 5 logs for all species tested except bacteroides forsythus (3.92 +/- 0.68 logs kill). conclusions: the data indicate that pdt utilizing a conventional light source is at least as effective as laser-induced treatment in vitro. furthermore, pdt achieves significant bactericidal activity in the presence of serum and blood when used with the set parameters of 10 j/cm2, 100 mw/cm2 and 12.5 micro g/ml tbo.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological status of patients with early-onset or aggressive periodontitis (eop) who had received supportive periodontal care (spc) every 3-6 months for a period of 5 years, following active periodontal treatment. material and methods:  the study population consisted of 25 individuals with early-onset periodontitis.  clinical examination and recordings of probing pocket depth (ppd) and clinical attachment level (cal) were performed at baseline prior to treatment (t0), 3 months following the termination of active periodontal treatment (t1) and annually at the spc appointments (t2,t3,t4,t5). microbiological samples were obtained at the 5-year spc (t5). subgingival plaque samples for each individual were collected from one deep pocket (>5 mm), based on pretreatment measurements,  randomly selected in each quadrant. the levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were determined using oligonucleotide probe hybridization. results: during the 5-year period, the mean of spc/patient was 12.7 sessions. a significant improvement was observed in ppd, cal, gingival bleeding index and suppuration following treatment. however, between t1 and t5, 134 sites in 20 patients deteriorated with a cal loss of> or =2 mm. out of these 134 sites showing disease progression, microbial samples were randomly obtained in 13 sites (9.7%) from 8 patients. among other factors, smoking and stress were found to have significant predictive value on the future attachment loss. p. gingivalis, t. denticola and total bacterial load were statistically significantly higher in  patients who experienced disease progression during the 5-year maintenance period. conclusions: for most eop patients, regular spc was effective in maintaining clinical and microbiological improvements attained after active periodontal therapy. however, a small percentage of sites was identified as progressive in 20 patients. variables found to be related to periodontal progression were the presence of as well as the high bacterial counts of p. gingivalis, t. denticola and total bacterial load, number of acute episodes, number of teeth lost, smoking and stress.

TI  == acquisition and loss of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia over a 5-year period: effect of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice.
AB  == objectives: the present study describes the natural history of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia over a 5-year period and the effect of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on these organisms in a normal adult population. material and methods: subgingival plaque  samples were collected from 504 adult volunteers. probing pocket depths (ppd) and relative attachment levels were measured using an automated probe. participants were matched for disease status (cpi), plaque index, age and gender, and allocated to receive either a triclosan/copolymer or placebo dentifrice. re-examination and subgingival plaque sampling was repeated after 1, 2, 3, 4 and  5 years. p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. intermedia were detected  and quantitated using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. logistic regression and generalised linear modelling were used to analyse the data. results: this 5-year longitudinal study showed considerable volatility in acquisition and loss  (below the level of detection) of all three organisms in this population. relatively few subjects had these organisms on multiple occasions. while p. gingivalis was related to loss of attachment and to ppd >/=3.5 mm, there was no relationship between a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. intermedia and disease progression over the 5 years of the study. smokers with p. gingivalis had more ppd >/=3.5 mm than smokers without this organism. there was no significant effect of the triclosan dentifrice on p. gingivalis or a. actinomycetemcomitans. subjects using triclosan were more likely to have p. intermedia than those not using the dentifrice; however this did not translate into these subjects having higher levels of p. intermedia and its presence was uniform showing no signs of increasing over the course of the study. conclusion: the present 5-year longitudinal study has shown the transient nature of colonisation with p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. intermedia in a normal adult population. the use of a triclosan-containing dentifrice did not lead to an overgrowth of these organisms. the clinical effect of the dentifrice would appear to be independent of its antimicrobial properties.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == can presence or absence of periodontal pathogens distinguish between subjects with chronic and aggressive periodontitis? a systematic review.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to determine to what extent the presence or absence of periodontal pathogens can distinguish between subjects with chronic and aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: a systematic review of cross sectional and longitudinal studies providing microbiological data both from patients with chronic periodontitis (chp) and aggressive periodontitis  (agp) at a subject level. strict inclusion criteria were applied. the presence or absence of five microorganisms was selected as primary study parameters: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), bacteroides forsythus (bf), and campylobacter rectus  (cr). results: the presence or absence of aa could be evaluated in 11 papers. in  seven papers the presence or absence of pg could be analysed. subject specific data on pi were available from six studies. two studies could be used regarding the presence or absence of bf, and two regarding cr. sensitivity and specificity  of every microbiological test were individually calculated for each selected study, assuming that the clinical diagnosis of agp or chp was the true status the tests attempted to detect. agp was considered to be the condition of interest and chp was considered equivalent to 'non-agp'. receiver operator characteristic (roc) diagrams were constructed using these data. roc diagrams indicated the limited discriminatory ability of all of the test parameters to identify subjects with agp. an additional assessment showed that the highly leukotoxic variant of aa was uniquely associated with patients suffering from aggressive periodontitis. however, in a high proportion of patients diagnosed with agp the presence of this variant could not be detected. conclusion: the presence or absence of aa, pg, pi, bf or cr could not discriminate between subjects with agp from those with chp.

TI  == antibacterial activity of synthetic human b defensin-2 against periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges  that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. human b defensin-2 (hbd-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight, which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or  stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. this peptide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. therefore, it is thought that hbd-2 plays an important role as one of natural immunities to bacterial infection. however, its activity is inhibited by body fluids such as serum. the aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or serum. the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 was tested against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and escherichia coli. antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were  performed in vitro. the antibacterial activity of hbd-2 was approximately equal to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. furthermore, the activity of  hbd-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained in the presence of 20% serum. our results suggest the possibility that synthetic  hbd-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.

TI  == enzymatic degradation of collagen-guided tissue regeneration membranes by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == bacterial infection in the vicinity of guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes was shown to have a negative effect on the clinical outcomes of this increasingly used technique. several oral and specifically periodontal bacteria were shown to adhere to such membranes in vivo and in vitro with a higher affinity to membranes constructed from collagen. the present study examined the role of periodontal bacteria and their enzymes in the degradation of commercially used collagen membranes. degradation of two collagen membranes [biomend (calcitek, colla-tec inc., plainsboro, nj) and bio-gide (geistlich biomaterials,  wolhousen, switzerland)] labeled by fluorescein isothiocyanate was examined by measuring soluble fluorescence. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and their enzymes were evaluated. collagenase from clostridium hystolyticum was used as a positive control. while whole cells of p. gingivalis were able to degrade both types of membranes, t. denticola could degrade bio-gide membranes only and a. actinomycetemcomitans whole cells could degrade none of the membranes. fractionation of p. gingivalis cells revealed that cell membrane associated proteases were responsible for the degradation of the two collagen membranes. in t. denticola, the purified major phenylalanine protease was found to be responsible for the degradation of bio-gide membranes. these results suggest that proteolytic bacterial enzymes may  take part in the degradation of collagen barrier membranes used for guided tissue regeneration.

TI  == distribution of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotypes and porphyromonas  gingivalis in japanese adults.
AB  == strains of the bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans found in the human  oral cavity are divided into five serotypes, a, b, c, d, and e. in this study, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes and porphyromonas gingivalis were isolated from 656 subgingival sites in systemically healthy japanese adults. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 19.5% of 328 japanese subjects, while 27.1% of subjects were positive for p. gingivalis. of 75 a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive sites, only one serotype was detected in 39 sites  (52.0%). the numbers of sites in which two different serotypes and three different serotypes were detected were 18 (25.0%) and 7 (9.3%), respectively. a.  actinomycetemcomitans serotype c was detected more frequently in sites that were  positive for both p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans (76.9%) than in sites that were p. gingivalis-negative and a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive (33.9%). in addition, serotype c was detected much more frequently than the other serotypes (<16%) in sites that were positive for both p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. these findings suggest that the characteristics of serotype c may differ from those of the other serotypes. this report is the first to use pcr to describe the distribution of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes in  humans and to examine the association between the distribution of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes and the presence of p. gingivalis.

TI  == generation of gingival t cell lines/clones specific with porphyromonas gingivalis pulsed dendritic cells from periodontitis patients.
AB  == objectives and background: it is well documented that in periodontitis lesions, most infiltrated gingival t cells are antigen-specific memory t cells. these cells play an important role as regulators and effector cells in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. in this study, we used dendritic cells (dcs) as antigen-presenting cells to generate human gingival t cell lines and clones specific for porphyromonas gingivalis from periodontitis patients. methods: autologous dcs were derived from the patients' adherent monocytes using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin (il)-4. lymphocytes were isolated from gingival biopsies using collagenase enzyme digestion and the number was increased by subsequent culturing in il-2-containing medium. t cells were then negatively sorted using flow cytometry, cocultured with p. gingivalis-pulsed dcs and subsequently expanded in the culture medium containing il-2. t cells were kept viable and active by periodic exposure to antigen-pulsed dcs. the specificity of the t cell lines was tested against four plaque bacteria: p. gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella  intermedia and actinomyces viscosus. the established t cell lines were then cloned. three p. gingivalis-specific t cell lines and 12 gingival t cell clones were generated. they all showed good specificity against p. gingivalis but not to other plaque bacteria. results: all t cell clones were positive for cd4 and the majority of them produced interferon gamma, but a minimal or negligible amount of il-5. conclusions: the data obtained clearly showed that monocyte-derived dcs could be used as powerful antigen-presenting cells to generate antigen-specific t cells from periodontitis tissues.

TI  == the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in the supragingival plaque of children with and without caries.
AB  == purpose: the present study was undertaken to determine the presence of 3 periodontopathic bacteria in the supragingival plaques of 3- to 16-year-old children with different oral health conditions. methods: dmft and dft, pma index  (p=papillary gingivitis, m=marginal gingivitis, and a=attached gingivitis), ohi (oral hygiene index), and oral malodor of each subject were determined prior to the collection of supragingival plaques. periodontopathic bacteria (p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans) in supragingival plaques were detected using an immunoslot blot assay with monoclonal 3 periodontopathic bacteria in the 2 subject groups (children with and without caries). p. gingivalis-positive subjects, but not their p. intermedia or a. actinomycetemcomitans counterparts, were correlated to oral malodor. oral malodor was also correlated to debris index, a component of ohi. results: the group with  the higher ohi showed a higher prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria. for the 3 periodontopathic bacteria in the subjects tested, p. gingivalis-, p. intermedia-, and a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive plaques were not age related. conclusions:  the supragingival plaques in children can harbor periodontopathic bacteria such as p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans.

AB  == objectives: the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of unsupervised, long-term use of a 0.3% triclosan/2% copolymer dentifrice on the progression of periodontal disease in a general adult population. methods: five hundred and four volunteers were enrolled in a double-blind, controlled clinical  trial. participants were matched for disease status, plaque index, age and gender. at the baseline examination, probing pocket depths and relative attachment levels were recorded and participants were assigned to either the test or control group. re-examinations took place after 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months. subgingival plaque samples were collected at each examination and assayed for porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia. a generalised linear model was used to analyse the data, with a number of covariates thought to influence the responses included as the possible  confounding effects. results: the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice had a significant effect in subjects with interproximal probing depths > or =3.5 mm, where it significantly reduced the number of sites with probing depths > or =3.5  mm at the following examination, when compared with the control group (p<0.001).  furthermore, this effect increased with increasing numbers of affected sites. there was no effect of the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice in individuals without  probing depths > or =3.5 mm at the previous examination. other factors significantly affecting probing pocket depths (ppd) included increasing age, smoking and presence of p. gingivalis. ppd > or =3.5 mm were positively associated with loss of attachment some 2 years later. conclusion: this study showed that in a normal adult population, unsupervised use of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice is effective in slowing the progression of periodontal disease.

AB  == objective: we analyzed the association of coronary heart disease (chd) and serology of periodontitis in a random sample (n=1163) of men (aged 45 to 74 years) by determining serum igg-antibodies to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. methods and results: chd (n=159) was more prevalent among edentulous than dentate subjects (19.8% and 12.1%, p=0.003). in the dentate population, chd was more common among subjects seropositive for p. gingivalis compared with those seronegative (14.0% and 9.7%,  p=0.029). accordingly, chd was more prevalent in subjects with a high combined antibody response than those with a low response (17.4% and 11.1%, p=0.026). when adjusted for age and several chd risk factors, the subjects with a high combined  antibody response had an odds ratio of 1.5 (95% ci, 0.95 to 2.50, p=0.077) for prevalent chd. in a linear regression model, the combined antibody response was directly associated with prevalent chd (p=0.046) and inversely with serum hdl cholesterol concentration (p=0.050). conclusions: in conclusion, edentulousness and serum antibodies to major periodontal pathogens were associated with chd. this suggests that periodontal infection or response of the host against the infection may play a role in the pathogenesis of chd.

TI  == ovine periodontitis as a potential model for periodontal studies. cross-sectional analysis of clinical, microbiological, and serum immunological parameters.
AB  == objectives: : to investigate infection and host immunity patterns in sheep with naturally occurring "broken-mouth" periodontitis. materials and methods: : eight  periodontally healthy (hs) and eight periodontally diseased ewes (pds) were selected. subgingival plaque and sera were collected and examined for evidence of human periodontitis-associated pathogens. serum igg titers were measured by elisa to multiple strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, dichelobacter nodosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum as well as several purified antigens (cysteine proteases, lps, k, and fimbriae). results: : neither the organism aa nor antigens to aa were found in any animal. most animals were positive for pg, bf, and pi, but dna probes detected no difference between hs and pds relative to  amounts of pathogens in subgingival plaque. pds had significantly higher serum igg titers to all pg strains, to 50% of bf strains, to the pi and fn strains, and to fimbriae and the two cysteine proteases (p-values ranging from 0.05 to 0.001). regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between number of teeth lost and serum igg antibody titers to whole-cell sonicate antigens of p. gingivalis strains (p<0.01) and body weight (p<0.01). conclusions: : the presence of pathogens associated with periodontitis was reflected in differences in serum  igg titers between healthy and diseased sheep. this may have influenced animal body weight and might have systemic health and economic consequences. the data suggest that susceptible and non-susceptible sheep can be identified for periodontal research.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to assess the dynamics of bacterial colonization in intra-osseous defects following guided tissue regeneration (gtr)  therapy using a resorbable barrier. patients and methods: in each of 30 patients, one intra-osseous defect was treated with gtr using a polylactic acid membrane (guidor). plaque samples were taken from the defect site, other teeth and mucous  membranes following initial therapy (baseline), and at 3, 6 and 12 months after periodontal surgery. additionally, samples were taken from the defect sites at 1, 2 and 4 weeks. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), and bacteroides forsythus (b.f.) were detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). supportive periodontal therapy was performed at 3-month intervals. results: in the 29 patients completing the study, the assessed microflora was detected in 3 (a.a.), 13 (p.g.) and 14 (b.f.) defect sites at baseline, in 2 (a.a.), 2 (p.g.) and 2 (b.f.) following surgical debridement, and  in 6 (a.a.), 10 (p.g.) and 22 (b.f.) at 12 months. defect site colonization following gtr therapy was significantly correlated with presurgical colonization  at other assessed teeth (a.a. and p.g.: tau = 0.45 and 0.66, respectively; p < 0.001), or on mucous membranes (b.f.: tau = 0.44, p < 0.001). conclusion: the colonization of periodontal pathogens at sites treated by gtr may correlate with  the intra-oral presence of these pathogens before surgery. if colonization of gtr sites by periodontal pathogens is to be prevented, intra-oral suppression/eradication of these pathogens may be required before surgery.

AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate effects of immunodeficiency on the periodontal infection characters of the specific pathogens of juvenile periodontitis. methods: a total of 36 immunodeficient guinea pigs produced by twice whole-body irradiation with 60co were divided randomly into four groups, in which actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans with p. gingivalis were inoculated into the gingival sulcus of two mandibular incisors respectively. the pigs in the control group did not receive any inoculation. at 2, 3 and 6 weeks after inoculation, three animals in  each group were sacrificed successively. clinical and histological examinations were used to examine the changes in the periodontal tissues. the other 36 normal  guinea pigs were divided into four groups and treated in a similar way described  above. results: significant periodontal damages were noted in immunodeficient pigs inoculated with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis or a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis in 2 and 3 weeks after bacterial inoculation. the damages were more severe than in the normal groups. the immunodeficient groups demonstrated larger numbers of osteoclasts than the normal groups (p < 0.05). conclusion: the loss of periodontal tissue in immunodeficient  hosts is much serious than those with normal defence system, after they are infected with a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis. abnormal defence system in hosts may play an important role in onset and development of juvenile periodontitis.

AB  == epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum igg antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (p < 0.05) when compared with those without  overgrowth. in addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth  than of those without overgrowth (p < 0.01). strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with  gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. however, no differences were found in serum igg antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. these results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor  for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass  for this unwanted side effect.

TI  == update on actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in human periodontal disease.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is an important pathogen of periodontitis in young individuals. porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen of severe adult periodontitis. a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis can be transmitted from family member to family member and may cause periodontitis in the recipient individual. in the usa, a. actinomycetemcomitans occurs more frequently in hispanics and asians than in caucasians. p. gingivalis is more common in hispanics, asians and blacks than in caucasians. a. actinomycetemcomitans and p.  gingivalis strains differ in genotype, serotype, toxin and enzyme production, and cellular invasiveness. variation in virulence may help explain differing clinical outcomes of periodontal a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis infections. a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis cannot be eradicated from the great majority of deep periodontal pockets by mechanical debridement alone. a. actinomycetemcomitans may be removed from subgingival sites by adjunctive systemic amoxicillin-metronidazole or other appropriate antibiotic therapies. subgingival eradication of p. gingivalis may require periodontal surgery as well  as antibiotic therapy.

AB  == periodontal disease is a complication of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm), although the mechanisms responsible for this relationship remain unclear. the aim of this study was to examine oral manifestations and the prevalence of periodontal pathogens from subgingival plaque samples and serum igg antibody levels against them in young japanese type 1 diabetic subjects. one hundred and seventeen japanese t1dm subjects (53 male, 64 female, mean age +/- sd, 16 +/- 6.5 years) participated in this study. thirty-nine periodontally healthy, age-matched nondiabetics served as controls. t1dm subjects were clinically assigned into three groups: 12 periodontitis, 32 gingivitis and 73 periodontally healthy. microbiological tests for four periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga ochracea were performed using 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction methods. serum igg antibody levels against 12 periodontal bacteria including the  four species assessed by polymerase chain reaction were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. in the t1dm subjects, the periodontitis group had a significantly longer mean duration of diabetes and a higher percentages of subjects harbouring p. gingivalis and p. intermedia than the periodontally healthy group. serum igg antibody levels against p. gingivalis were significantly elevated in the periodontitis group compared with gingivitis and periodontally healthy groups. these results indicate that japanese t1dm subjects are a high-risk group for periodontal disease and both p. gingivalis infection and duration of t1dm are risk factors for the progression of periodontitis in patients with t1dm.

TI  == high prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by pcr in the oral cavities of periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori has been associated with the development of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. although it may be transmitted through the oral cavity, it is unknown whether the oral cavity acts as a permanent reservoir for this bacterium. the purpose of this study was to use nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to clarify whether the oral cavity acts as a reservoir for h. pylori. methods: the existence of h. pylori in the oral cavity was determined by  nested pcr in 57 subjects and by culture method in 18 subjects. the presence of periodontopathic bacteria was also determined by 16s rrna-based pcr method. results: although h. pylori was rarely detected in the oral cavity by culture technique, it was frequently detected (35.1%) by nested pcr in the oral cavity, especially among periodontitis patients who had the bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract (46.4%). among the subjects who harbored h. pylori in the  stomach or duodenum, 41.2% of patients with periodontal pockets > or = 4 mm and 9.1% of subjects without pockets showed h. pylori in dental plaque, although a statistically significant difference was not observed. one patient who had periodontal pockets retained h. pylori in the oral cavity even after eradication  of the bacterium from the stomach and duodenum. most (8/10) of the patients who had h. pylori in dental plaque harbored bacteroides forsythus in their oral cavities. conclusion: close attention should be given to periodontitis patients who harbor h. pylori in the oral cavity.

AB  == to determine the prevalence of periodontitis in an italian young adult population and the relationship with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque. a full-mouth periodontal and oral examination was performed in 70 subjects. dental and behaviour habits were assessed with a standardised questionnaire. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the deepest pocket of the first molars in each quadrant with a sterile curette. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were detected using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction. at subject  level, the prevalence of bleeding on probing, calculus, normal pocket depth (pd), pd > 5mm and bacterial positivity were 44.8%, 43.3%, 22.9%, 11.4% and 95.7%, respectively. at quadrant level bacterial prevalence was 79.4%; p. intermedia was the most common bacteria (79.0%); a. actinomycetemcomitans had a prevalence of 40.8%. a significant linear trend across categories of gingival conditions (healthy, bleeding on probing, calculus presence) was detected for p. intermedia  (p = 0.0038) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.00005) proportions. no significant association was observed between pathogenic bacteria and pd, nor with behavioural attitudes. gingival conditions are found to be a good predictors (vpp = 85%) for periodontopathic bacteria. for the italian population, as no data are  present, prospective longitudinal studies are needed to examine the relationship  between pd and bacteria presence with periodontal disease onset and/or progression.

TI  == the microflora recovered from the outer-surfaces of the frialit-2 implanto-prosthetic connector.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to examine the outer-surface microbiota  of the prosthetic connector of frialit-2 implants, and to compare the microbial findings with the peri-implant parameters 2 years after functional loading. in 16 implant-treated patients (55.8 +/- 9.5 years) the outer-surface micro-organisms of the prosthetic connectors were determined in 32 frialit-2 implants. the functional loading time of the prosthetic suprastructures was 24.1 +/- 13.8 months on average. after removal of the implant-supported restoration, microbial  samples were obtained from the outer-surfaces of the frialit-2 prosthetic connector. the microbial plaque samples were specified on cdc-blood agar as percentages of the total cultivable flora. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was semiquantitively determined on tsbv-agar in cfu/ml. the microbial plaque samples were dominated by actinomyces israelii (68.8%), eubacterium lentum (56.3%) and veillonella parvula (43.8%) with proportions ranking between 3.9% (v. parvula) and 11.1% (a. israelii). the most frequently detected gram-negative microorganisms were fusobacterium nucleatum (87.5%), porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3%), and peptostreptococcus micros (68.8%) with enhanced proportions for p. gingivalis (11.4%) and p. micros (11.4%). no statistical significant correlation  could be established between the microbiota present on the outer-surfaces of the  f2-connector and the peri-implant parameters examined. the outer-surface microflora recovered from the implanto-prosthetic-connector of frialit-2 implants reveals a colonization with gram-positive bacteria and potentially harmful gram-negative micro-organisms that were frequently detected, but present at low levels. after 2 years of restorative loading, the outer-surface microbial colonization is compatible with peri-implant soft tissue health.

TI  == enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor by periodontal pathogens in gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) has recently attracted attention as a potent inducer of vascular permeability and angiogenesis. aberrant angiogenesis is often associated with lesion formation in chronic periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to investigate the properties of vegf expression in human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) culture. hgf were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (lps), vesicle (ve) and outer membrane protein (omp) from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. hgf constitutively produced vegf and levels were significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) by stimulation with ve and omp from a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis at concentrations of 10 microg/ml or higher. on the other hand, vegf levels were not increased by lps stimulation. vegf mrna expression was also observed in ve- and omp-stimulated hgf. a vascular permeability enhancement (vpe) assay was performed using guinea pigs to ascertain whether supernatant from cultures of ve- and omp-stimulated hgf enhance vascular permeability in vivo. supernatant from cultures of ve- and omp-stimulated hgf strongly induced vpe. this was markedly suppressed upon simultaneous injection of anti-vegf polyclonal antibodies with the supernatant. heating and protease treatment of the stimulants reduced the vegf enhancing levels in ve and omp in vitro. these results suggest that ve and omp may be crucial heat-labile and protease-sensitive components of periodontal pathogens that enhance vegf expression. in addition, vegf might be associated with the etiology of periodontitis in its early stages according to neovascularization stimulated by periodontal pathogens causing swelling and edema.

TI  == the influence of membrane exposure on the outcomes of guided tissue regeneration: clinical and microbiological aspects.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of membrane exposure on guided tissue regeneration (gtr). thirty patients with 2-wall or 3-wall intraosseous defects were treated with gtr. periodontal index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth, clinical attachment level and recession were  assessed at the baseline examination, as well as immediately prior to and six months after gtr. the numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans on the retrieved expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-ptfe)  membranes were assessed using polymerase chain reaction. the results showed that  26.3% of the membrane exposure sites had zero attachment gain. the membrane exposure sites tended to achieve a smaller clinical attachment gain and had significantly greater marginal tissue recession ( p = 0.006). in addition, the exposed membranes harbored significantly more a. actinomycetemcomitans than the non-exposed membranes (p = 0.029). in conclusion, membrane exposure resulted in a poor gtr outcome. the amount of a. actinomycetemcomitans on the exposed membrane  may be a major contributing factor to the outcome of gtr.

TI  == determination of eight selected periodontal pathogens in the subgingival plaque of maxillary first molars in japanese school children aged 8-11 years.
AB  == to prevent the onset or progression of periodontitis, we must understand when periodontal pathogens are first harbored and how they develop the biofilm that causes periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between clinical status and selected periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque in school children. this study was conducted with 95 school children, 8-11 years old. the presence and distribution of eight selected periodontal pathogens sampled from the maxillary right first molar were determined by an indirect immunofluorescent technique and compared with clinical  parameters. of the 95 sites sampled, only one site had all eight pathogens and five sites did not have any of the eight pathogens. the mean number of positive pathogens per site was 3.5 +/- 1.8 and mean percentage of positive pathogens was  3.82 +/- 4.22%. the number and total percentage of positive pathogens were strongly correlated with the plaque index (pi). in addition, the number of positive pathogens was correlated to the presence of subgingival calculus. the most frequently found pathogens were campylobacter rectus (84.2%) and eikenella corrodens (83.2%), and the least, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype c (7.4%). of the eight pathogens, the frequency and distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis were significantly correlated with pi and the presence of calculus. in addition, seven sites with both p. gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus showed a  correlation with gingival inflammation. in conclusion, the presence of p. gingivalis or p. gingivalis and b. forsythus may be a risk marker to be sought in screening for the onset of periodontal disease.

TI  == isotypic antibody response to plaque anaerobes in periodontal disease.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that locally produced immunoglobulin (ig)a could be more protective than igg and that there could be a relationship between  crevicular fluid-specific iga levels and the onset of periodontal disease. this study was designed to investigate this hypothesis regarding specific immune responses towards 4 plaque anaerobes in gingival crevicular fluid and saliva from patients with periodontopathies and controls. methods: gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) and whole saliva were collected from 35 adults with periodontitis and 24 periodontally healthy adults (controls). antigens were extracted from actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum and used to set up specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) tests to assess iga and igg levels to these microorganisms in the fluids collected. results: the crevicular fluid of periodontitis patients contained significantly higher levels of igg to the 4 microorganisms tested than  that of controls (p < 10(-6) for all comparisons). iga levels to the 4 bacteria were statistically significantly much higher in control crevicular fluid (p < 10(-7) for all comparisons). controls also had statistically significantly higher levels of specific salivary iga than patients (p < 0.02 for all comparisons). conclusions: these data support the potentially protective role of specific iga directed to oral microorganisms involved in the onset and development of periodontal disease.

TI  == igg subclass specific antibody response to periodontopathic organisms in hiv-positive patients.
AB  == background: we previously reported an increased rate of progression of periodontal disease over an 18-month period in human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-positive subjects compared to controls. the mechanism for disease progression and rapid tissue loss was unknown. data on the microbiological studies failed to show any significant difference in the microbial characteristics of the periodontal lesions in hiv-positive patients compared to hiv-negative controls. immunological analysis had identified neutrophils as an important component of the host defense against periodontal infection, especially against rapid tissue loss. serum igg reactivities to periodontal pathogens in hiv-positive patients with periodontitis were reduced. other data provided circumstantial evidence to suggest that igg subclass (igg2) specific antibody might assist bacterial clearing in periodontal infection. the aim of the current  study was to examine the specific igg subclass antibody response to a panel of periodontopathic organisms: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), and bacteroides forsythus (bf) in hiv-positive patients compared to hiv-negative controls. methods: sera from 120 hiv-positive patients (40 periodontitis, 69 gingivitis, and 11 no oral diseases)  were tested for igg subclass specific antibody response to the above listed 6 organisms using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. data were compared with those  obtained from 40 hiv-negative control subjects (35 periodontitis, 2 gingivitis, and 3 no oral diseases). results: in the hiv-positive group, a consistently high  response rate was found in igg1 to all the bacteria tested. in addition, high levels of igg3 and igg4 to pg and igg1 and igg2 to pi were also present. however, no significant difference was detected among the periodontitis, gingivitis, and no oral disease subgroups. when the periodontitis patients from the hiv-positive  group were compared to the hiv-negative group, no difference in the antibody levels and response rates was noted. conclusion: we conclude that in hiv-positive patients, the specific igg subclass antibody response to periodontopathic organisms was similar to that of hiv-negative subjects.

TI  == dna from periodontopathogenic bacteria is immunostimulatory for mouse and human immune cells.
AB  == although bacterial dna (bdna) containing unmethylated cpg motifs stimulates innate immune cells through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9), its precise role in the pathophysiology of diseases is still equivocal. here we examined the immunostimulatory effects of dna extracted from periodontopathogenic bacteria. a  major role in the etiology of periodontal diseases has been attributed to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and peptostreptococcus micros. we therefore isolated dna from these bacteria and stimulated murine macrophages and human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) in vitro. furthermore, hek 293 cells transfected with human tlr-9 were also stimulated with these dna preparations. we observed that dna from these pathogens stimulates macrophages and gingival fibroblasts to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 in a dose-dependent manner. methylation of the cpg motifs abolished the observed effects. activation of hek 293 cells expressing tlr-9 which were responsive to bdna but not to lipopolysaccharide confirmed that immunostimulation was achieved by bdna. in addition, the examined bdna differed in the ability to stimulate murine macrophages, hgf, and tlr-9-transfected cells. dna from a. actinomycetemcomitans elicited a potent cytokine response, while dna from p. gingivalis and p. micros showed lower immunostimulatory activity. taken together, the results strongly suggest that dna from a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. micros possesses immunostimulatory properties in regard to cytokine secretion by macrophages and fibroblasts. these stimulatory effects are  due to unmethylated cpg motifs within bdna and differ between distinct periodontopathogenic bacteria strains. hence, immunostimulation by dna from a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. micros could contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == in vitro effect of laser irradiation on cementum-bound endotoxin isolated from periodontally diseased roots.
AB  == background: in a previous study, we evaluated the in vivo effects of an nd:yag laser on periodontal disease by measuring crevicular interleukin (il)-1beta levels before and after laser application. it was found that laser therapy was less effective than traditional scaling and root planing. these results might be  due to incomplete removal of microbial residues and cementum-bound endotoxin on root surfaces by the laser. in this study, we explored the in vitro effectiveness of an nd:yag laser for the elimination of cementum-bound endotoxin by measuring il-1beta changes in stimulated monocytes. methods: fresh human monocytes were harvested from adults without periodontitis and grown in rpmi 1640 medium. diseased cementum particles were collected and prepared from teeth with untreated periodontitis and were irradiated with 5 levels of laser energy. cementum particles were subjected to endotoxin testing by a limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assay and then were incubated with cultured monocytes. production of il-1beta in  stimulated monocytes was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantified by spectrophotometry. results: the endotoxin unit (eu) of diseased cementum was 18.4 eu/mg, which seemed to be remarkably lower than that of common  periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis (381) at 15,300 eu/mg/ml, prevotella intermedia (atcc 25611) at 227 eu/mg/ml, and fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 25586) at 1,987 eu/mg/ml. monocytes subjected to stimulation by diseased cementum particles without laser irradiation produced 124 to 145 pg/ml il-1beta, 9- to 18-fold higher than that of unstimulated monocytes (7.07 to 15.95 pg/ml). diseased cementum particles after irradiation with various energy levels  of the nd:yag laser could still stimulate monocytes to secrete 89 to 129 pg/ml il-1beta. no statistically significant difference was found in the production of  il-1beta induced by diseased-bound cementum with or without laser irradiation. conclusions: the nd:yag laser varying from 50 mj, 10 pps to 150 mj, 20 pps, for 2 minutes, did not seem to be effective in destroying diseased cementum endotoxin.

TI  == microbiological markers for prediction and assessment of treatment outcome following non-surgical periodontal therapy.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus are considered major putative periodontal pathogens. however, it remains unclear what combinations or what levels of these bacteria influence treatment outcome. the purpose of the present study was to establish useful pathogenic markers for prediction and assessment of treatment outcome following scaling and root planing (srp). methods: a total of 1,149 sites in 104  chronic periodontitis patients were clinically examined at baseline. three months after srp, 606 sites in 56 of these patients were reexamined. subgingival plaque  samples taken from the examined sites at baseline and 3 months were analyzed for  the detection and quantification of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and  b. forsythus using a colorimetric polymerase chain reaction technique. results: at baseline, high levels and a combination of p. gingivalis and b. forsythus were frequently detected in diseased sites (74%). srp reduced the levels and the coexistence of p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (from 75% to 43%). however, in treated sites where there was less reduction of probing depth (<2 mm), or where bleeding on probing (bop) or suppuration was detected, residual coexistence of p. gingivalis and b. forsythus and a high level of p. gingivalis after srp were significantly more frequent. furthermore, srp did not improve bop at sites exhibiting initially high levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: these  results suggest that the combination of p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, as well as the level of p. gingivalis, is useful in assessing treatment outcome. furthermore, the high level of a. actinomycetemcomitans before srp is a possible  valuable predictor of treatment outcome.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and other putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with and without periodontal destruction.
AB  == background and aims: bacteria play an essential role in the pathogenesis of destructive periodontal disease. it has been suggested that not all bacteria associated with periodontitis may be normal inhabitants of a periodontally healthy dentition. in particular, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans have been isolated infrequently from subjects without periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare prevalence and proportions of a number of periodontal bacteria in periodontitis patients and control subjects. material and methods: in all, 116 consecutive subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe periodontitis (mean age 42.4) and 94 subjects without radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss (mean age 40.4) were recruited for the study. the gingival condition in the control group varied between gingival health and various degrees of gingivitis. in patients, the deepest pocket in each quadrant was selected for microbiological sampling. in control subjects all mesial and distal sites of all first molars were selected for sampling. all paper points from a patient were pooled and processed for anaerobic cultivation within 6 h after sampling. clinical variables of sampled sites included bleeding index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more often prevalent in patients than in controls. the highest odds ratios were found for p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (12.3 and 10.4 resp.). other odds ratios varied from 3.1 to 7.7 for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. micros, respectively. absolute numbers of target bacteria were all higher in patients, but only the mean percentage of b. forsythus was significantly higher in patients in comparison to controls (p < 0.001). conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, f. nucleatum and p. micros are all significant markers for destructive periodontal disease in adult subjects. based  on calculated odds ratios, b. forsythus and p. gingivalis are the strongest bacterial markers for this disease and are infrequently cultured from subjects without periodontal bone loss.

TI  == serum markers of periodontal disease status and inflammation in hemodialysis patients.
AB  == background: hemodialysis (hd) patients face a 25% annual mortality rate, with 50% of reported deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease. all-cause and cardiovascular mortality correlate with such acute-phase proteins as c-reactive protein (crp). hepatic crp synthesis is upregulated by inflammation; however, elevated crp values frequently are found in the absence of apparent infection or  inflammation. because destructive periodontal diseases have been associated with  elevated crp levels, we questioned whether destructive periodontal diseases could contribute to elevated crp values in hd populations. methods: sera from 86 consecutive dentate hd patients were assayed for levels of immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody to six periodontal species by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: crp values for the subject population ranged from less than 6.9 to 159 mg/l (median, 8.2 mg/l). univariate comparisons between subjects with or without elevated crp levels (>10 mg/l) showed that crp level elevation was associated significantly (p < 0.05) with greater doses of human recombinant erythropoietin and lower levels of hemoglobin, serum iron, transferrin saturation (tsat), albumin averaged over the 3 preceding months, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. log serum igg antibody levels to porphyromonas gingivalis also were significantly greater in the group with elevated crp levels (p = 0.013). subsequent multivariate logistic regression showed that log serum antibody levels to p gingivalis remained significant (p = 0.02) after controlling for nonperiodontal sources of elevated crp, hemoglobin, tsat, and triglyceride values. conclusion: these results suggest that elevated levels of igg antibody to bacterial species associated with destructive periodontal diseases are associated with elevated crp values in hd populations.

AB  == background: the aim of this study was to determine the distribution patterns of porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in periodontitis patients after standard mechanical periodontal therapy, and to evaluate the effect of additional local antibiotic therapy, given to all teeth with cultural evidence of these bacteria. methods: 17 patients were included. 852 separate subgingival microbial samples were taken from the mesial and distal aspect of every tooth in 17 subjects at baseline. 46 of these samples, from 10 positive subjects, showed cultural evidence for p. gingivalis. 82 samples, from 5 subjects, were a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive. three subjects showed no evidence for persistence of a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis. in the other 14 subjects, all a. actinomycetemcomitans- or p. gingivalis-positive teeth  were treated with tetracycline fibers (actisite(r)). sub-gingival microbial samples were again taken from two sites of every tooth, 1 month after fiber removal. 89% of the initially p. gingivalis-positive sites were now negative, but 16 previously negative sites now tested positive. 77% of the initially a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive sites were now negative, but 5 previously negative sites now tested positive. the teeth with persisting p. gingivalis or a. actinomycetemcomitans were again treated with fibers. two sites of every tooth were once more sampled after 1 month. at this time, 5 subjects still showed cultural evidence of p. gingivalis at a total of 19 sites, and 4 subjects were positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans in a total of 27 sites. these 9 patients were finally submitted to systemic antibiotic therapy (3 x 250 mg metronidazole plus 3 x 375 mg amoxicillin/d for 7 days). despite of all efforts, p. gingivalis  was again detected 3 months later in isolated sites in 3 subjects, and a. actinomycetemcomitans could be cultivated from one single site. conclusions: therapy with tetracycline fibers guided by microbiological diagnosis effectively  reduced p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans locally, but was unable to completely eradicate the target organisms. additional systemic antibiotic therapy further reduced p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. the observed persistence patterns suggest that reemergence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was due to recolonization, whereas the strikingly reproducible local reemergence of p. gingivalis in some sites indicated failed eradication.

TI  == transmission of periodontal disease-associated bacteria from teeth to osseointegrated implant regions.
AB  == purpose: the presence of periodontopathic bacteria is a risk factor for peri-implantitis. the present study examined colonization by periodontopathic bacteria and their transmission from periodontal pockets to osseointegrated implant sulcus. materials and methods: plaque samples were collected from 105 sites in the 15 patients who participated in the study. colonization by these bacteria was examined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and culture. the transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from periodontal sites of natural teeth to the implant sulcus was analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: the pcr detection rates of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola were 80.0%, 53.3%, 46.7%, 60.0% and 40.0%, respectively. colonizations by p gingivalis and a actinomycetemcomitans were statistically correlated with periodontal pockets and implant sulcus regions (p < .01). the pfge patterns of the p gingivalis strains isolated from each patient were identical, but differed from those from other patients. the pfge patterns of p intermedia strains were identical in 2 out of 3 patients. discussion: these analyses indicated that there appeared to be transmission of p gingivalis and p intermedia from the periodontal pocket to the peri-implant region. conclusion: elimination of these periodontal pathogens from the patient's oral cavity before  administering dental implant treatment may inhibit colonization by these pathogens and reduce the risk of peri-implantitis.

AB  == microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. noradrenaline and adrenaline, which  are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. the aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. we established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees c. we assessed organism growth by optical density (od(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. we observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species  responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. the most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). we also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. individual organisms from different microbial  complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine  levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == comparison of microbial cultivation and a commercial pcr based method for detection of periodontopathogenic species in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == objectives: microbiological laboratory procedures are involved in diagnosis and therapy control of progressive and refractory forms of periodontitis. in recent years techniques have been developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. the purpose of this study was to validate the commercially available micro-dent(r) test which employs probes for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus and t. denticola. methods: 122 plaque samples obtained from periodontal pockets with various depths from 33 early onset periodontitis (eop) patients and 15 periodontally healthy subjects were analysed by cultivation and the microdent(r) kit. results: both cultivation and the nucleic acid based assay showed a positive correlation of pocket depth with the frequency and quantity of periodontopathogenic species. t. denticola was found only in pockets  > 4 mm in eop patients. comparison of the two methods revealed that the microdent(r) kit identified both p. gingivalis and b. forsythus more often than did the cultivation method. conclusions: nucleic acid techniques should replace cultivation methods as gold standard in microbiological diagnosis of progressive  periodontitis. the micro-dent(r) kit can be recommended for microbiological laboratories analysing subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == relationship of changes in interleukin-8 levels and granulocyte elastase activity in gingival crevicular fluid to subgingival periodontopathogens following non-surgical periodontal therapy in subjects with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objectives: to determine the effect of scaling and root planing (srp) on the interrelations of subgingival periodontopathogens and both interleukin-8 (il-8) and granulocyte elastase activity in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and to assess their relations to the short-term treatment response in management of chronic periodontitis. material and methods: gcf and subgingival plaque were collected from 16 subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis at baseline and 4 weeks after srp. il-8 levels were determined by elisa. granulocyte elastase activity was analyzed with a specific substrate, pgluproval-pna, and the maximal  rate of elastase activity (mr-ea) was calculated. 5 dna-probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (a. a.), b. forsythus (b.f.), p.  gingivalis (p.g.), p. intermedia (p.i.), and t. denticola (t.d.), with a sensitivity = 103 cells/paper point. results: il-8 and mr-ea levels in gcf decreased significantly after srp (p < 0.001) with a corresponding reduction of total count of the species. of the sites with probing depth (pd) >/= 5.0 mm and co-infection by b.f., p.g., p.i. & t.d. at baseline, the sites without persistent co-infection of these species after srp exhibited a significant reduction of il-8 levels (p < 0.02), mr-ea levels (p < 0.02) and pd (p < 0.01). no such change was  found in the sites where such a co-infection persisted. moreover, reduction of il-8 levels in those pocket sites was accompanied by a concomitant reduction of mr-ea (p < 0.02) and pd (p < 0.01), while no significant change in mr-ea levels and pd was noted in those pocket sites that exhibited an increase of il-8 levels  after srp. at baseline, the former group of sites showed significantly higher il-8 levels than the latter group of sites (p < 0.02). conclusions: il-8-related  granulocyte elastase activity was related to the change in infection patterns of  the target periodontopathogens following scaling and root planing. varying initial il-8 levels in gcf and a corresponding shifting change of granulocyte elastase activity in gcf may characterize the different short-term treatment responses.

TI  == discrete proteolysis of focal contact and adherens junction components in porphyromonas gingivalis-infected oral keratinocytes: a strategy for cell adhesion and migration disabling.
AB  == adhesive interactions of cells are critical to tissue integrity. we show that infection with porphyromonas gingivalis, a major pathogen in the periodontal disease periodontitis, interferes with both cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion in the oral keratinocyte cell line hok-16. thus, infected cells showed reduced adhesion to extracellular matrix, changes in morphology from spread to rounded, and impaired motility on purified matrices in transwell migration assays and scratch assays. western blot analysis of p. gingivalis-challenged hok-16 cells revealed proteolysis of focal contact components (e.g., focal adhesion kinase), adherens junction proteins (e.g., catenins), and adhesion signaling molecules (e.g., the tyrosine kinase src). proteolysis was selective, since important components of adherens junctions (e-cadherin) or signaling molecules (extracellular signal-regulated kinases erk1/2) were not degraded. the virulence  factors gingipains, cysteine proteinases expressed by p. gingivalis, are likely responsible for this proteolytic attack, since they directly digested specific proteins in pull-down experiments, and their proteolytic activity was blocked by  the cysteine proteinase inhibitor n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone and also by a caspase inhibitor. proteolysis was strain dependent, such that atcc 33277 and 381 had high proteolytic potential, whereas w50 showed almost no proteolytic activity. these findings may help explain the formation of gingival pockets between cementum and periodontal epithelium, a hallmark of periodontitis. furthermore, they illustrate a new pathogenetic paradigm of infection whereby bacteria may disrupt the integrity of epithelia.

TI  == [research on inhibition of sodium fluoride on five subgingival bacteria in vitro].
AB  == this in vitro study was aimed at observing inhibition action of fluoride on 5 common periodontal bacteria in subgingival microflora. the liquid media two-fold  dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibition concentration (mic)  of sodium fluoride (naf) to 9 strains of bacteria representing the main periodontopathic species(p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedius) and the periodontal beneficial species (s. sanguis) and 1 strain of s. sorbrinus. the results showed that all the bacteria were inhibited at different concentration of naf. the mic values ranged from 128 micrograms/ml for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans, 256 micrograms/ml for s. sorbrinus, 1024 micrograms/ml for p. intermedius to 2048-4096 micrograms/ml for s. sanguis. the results suggest that naf can also be used as a periodontal anti-bacterium agent and those preparations containing about 1000 micrograms/ml fluoride can be used effectively against the periodontopathic bacteria without disturbing the local ecological balance.

TI  == gtr treatment of intrabony defects in patients with early-onset and chronic adult periodontitis.
AB  == young, systemically healthy subjects may suffer from early-onset forms of periodontitis characterized by the presence of localized deep vertical bony defects. the aim of this study was to compare the healing response after guided tissue regeneration (gtr) treatment of similar intrabony defects in patients affected by early-onset and chronic adult periodontitis. twenty systemically healthy, nonsmoking subjects were enrolled in the study; 10 were affected by early-onset periodontitis (eop) and 10 by chronic adult periodontitis (cap). in each subject, only one deep vertical bony defect (intrabony component > 4 mm, probing attachment level > or = 8 mm) was treated according to the principles of  gtr therapy with titanium-reinforced e-ptfe membranes. at the time of the surgery and at the 1-year follow-up, a microbiologic test for the identification of the main periodontopathogens was performed in each of the treated sites. there was no statistically significant difference at 1 year in the amount of clinical attachment gain (p = .4), reduction of probing pocket depth (p = .3), or increase in gingival recession (p = 1.0) between eop and cap patients. the 1-year microbiologic results demonstrated the complete disappearance of the putative periodontopathogens from all surgically treated sites in both patient groups. the results of the study demonstrated that deep intrabony defects in patients with eop can be successfully treated by means of gtr procedures and that the suppression of periodontopathogens under threshold values can be maintained for at least 1 year, provided that the patient is enrolled in a maintenance program consisting of recalls for professional tooth cleaning and reinforcement of self-performed oral hygiene measures at 1-month intervals.

AB  == interleukin (il)-1 alpha, il-1 beta and il-1 receptor antagonist (ra) play a major role in regulation of the inflammatory response in periodontal tissues. the aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of genetic variation in the il-1 gene family among periodontitis patients and controls, taking into account smoking and microbiology as additional variables. there were 53 non-smoking and 52 smoking patients with severe adult periodontitis and 53 periodontal healthy controls genotyped for genetic variation in the il-1 gene family. the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was established by culture techniques. a higher frequency of genotype+ (il-1a*2 + il-1b*2 + il-1rn*2) was found in non-smoking periodontitis patients in whom p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans could not be detected (42.1% vs. 11.3% in controls;  p = 0.0068; or 5.7, 95% ci: 1.6-19.8). this data provide evidence that polymorphisms in genes of the il-1 family are associated with severe adult periodontitis and may be a risk factor for severe periodontitis.

TI  == microbiological findings and host response in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to characterise microbiota and inflammatory host response around implants and teeth in patients with peri-implantitis. we included 17 partly edentulous patients with a total of 98 implants, of which 45 showed marginal bone loss of more than three fixture threads after the first year of loading. nineteen subjects with stable marginal tissue conditions served as controls. oral hygiene, gingival inflammation, and probing pocket depth were evaluated clinically at teeth and implants. microbiological and crevicular fluid  samples were collected from five categories of sites: 1) implants with peri-implantitis (pi), 2) stable implants (si) in patients with both stable and peri-implantitis implants, 3) control implants (ci) in patients with stable implants alone, 4) teeth in patients (tp) and 5) controls (tc). crevicular fluid  from teeth and implants was analysed for elastase activity, lactoferrin and il-1  beta concentrations. elastase activity was higher at pi than at ci in controls. lactoferrin concentration was higher at pi than at si in patients with peri-implantitis. higher levels of both lactoferrin and elastase activity were found at pi than at teeth in patients. the concentrations of il-1 beta were about the same in the various sites. microbiological dna-probe analysis revealed a putative periodontal microflora at teeth and implants in patients and controls. patients with peri-implantitis harboured high levels of periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. these findings indicate a site-specific inflammation rather than a patient-associated specific host response.

TI  == contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens.
AB  == experimental studies have shown that intraoral transmission of bacteria can occur. of course, the question arises as to how this transmission may happen. in  this study, the contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens is examined and compared to the microbial load of the periodontal pockets. in ten untreated chronic periodontitis patients, four interdental sites were professionally brushed with one interdental brush per patient. subsequently, samples from the depths of the pockets (of the specific interdental sites) were obtained with paper-points. the interdental brush samples and the samples of the  subgingival plaque, obtained by the pooled paper-points, were processed for dark-field microscopy examination as well as anaerobic culturing. the results showed that, although significant differences could be found between the brushes  and paper-points with direct microscopy, the culturing did not uncover many differences. on the contrary, the detection frequencies of specific bacterial species were almost the same between the two. the total anaerobic colony-forming  units (cfu), p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and e. corrodens found on the brushes showed a significant correlation with the subgingival plaque samples (p<0.005). these results suggest that, in untreated situations, interdental brushes are contaminated relatively easily by putative periodontopathogens in numbers comparable to their presence in periodontal pockets. this contamination could be  a factor in the intraoral spread of bacteria.

TI  == [detection of periodontal pathogenic microorganisms in atheromatous plaque. preliminary results].
AB  == introduction: recent studies suggest that chronic infections, including those associated with periodontitis, increase the risk for coronary vascular disease. we hypothesize that oral microorganisms including periodontal bacterial pathogens enter the blood stream during transient bacteremias where they may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. materials and methods: to test this hypothesis, 34 human specimens obtained during carotid endarterectomy or bypass procedures were examined by use of specific oligonucleotide primers for porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus in polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays. results: twenty (59%) of the 34 specimens tested positive for bacterial 16s rdna. subsequent hybridization of the bacterial 16s rdna positive specimens with species-specific oligonucleotide probes revealed that 32.4% of the 34 atheromas tested positive for at least one of the target periodontal pathogens. further analysis of the results in the bacterial positive group (n = 20) shows that 55% of the atheromas tested positive for at least one of the target periodontal pathogens. conclusion: these findings indicate that periodontal pathogens are present in atherosclerotic plaques, where they may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis leading to coronary  vascular disease and other clinical sequelae.

TI  == simple and rapid detection of serum antibody to periodontopathic bacteria by dot  blotting.
AB  == the aim of this study was to detect the specific immunoglobulin g antibodies against periodontopathic bacteria by dot blotting. in the procedure used, bacterial preparations were blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. after blocking  the nonspecific binding sites, the diluted serum was blotted onto the preparations. the membrane was immersed in secondary antibodies and then in substrate buffer. the colored blots were then evaluated. to test the reliability  of this procedure, 20 serum samples were examined for antibody: ten for anti-porphyromonas gingivalis antibody, and the other ten for anti-actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans antibody. five samples out of each set of ten had previously been confirmed as having high enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (elisa) titers to the antigen, while the other five had been confirmed as having  average titer levels. both whole-cell sonic extracts and fimbriae of p. gingivalis were used as antigens in the dot blotting, in order to compare their use as antigens in assays of the patients' sera. elisa was also used to measure anti-p. gingivalis antibody titers. for the measurement of igg antibodies against a. actinomycetemcomitans, formalin-killed whole cells were used. fifty serum samples were examined for igg antibodies against a. actinomycetemcomitans by dot  blotting and elisa. with both antigens, after 4 h, coloration of blots was more clearly visible for the high-titer sera than for the average-titer sera. the intensity of coloration of the blots for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans showed correlation with the elisa titers. a particularly significant correlation was shown when p. gingivalis fimbriae were used as antigen. these results suggest that this dot blot method is a simple and rapid means of detection of serum antibodies, and that it shows promise as a chair-side assay method.

TI  == regulation of matrix metalloproteinase production by cytokines, pharmacological agents and periodontal pathogens in human periodontal ligament fibroblast cultures.
AB  == matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). produced by both infiltrating and resident cells of the periodontium, play a role in physiologic and pathologic events. it is recognized that an imbalance between activated mmps and their endogenous inhibitors leads to pathologic breakdown of the extracellular matrix during periodontitis. to date, little is known about the regulation of mmp synthesis and secretion in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (pdlfs). the purpose of this  study was to examine the effects of cytokines, pharmacological agents (protein synthesis inhibitor and protein kinase c inhibitors) and predominant periodontal  pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis) on  mmp production in human pdlfs using gelatin zymography. the gelatin zymograms revealed that the main gelatinase secreted by human pdlfs migrated at 72 kda and  represents mmp-2. minor gelatinolytic bands were also observed at 92 kda regions  that correspond to mmp-9. we found that a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and il-1alpha can elevate mmp-2 secretion in human pdlfs. these results indicate  that periodontal pathogens and inflammatory cytokines play an important role in tissue destruction and disintegration of extracellular matrix in periodontal diseases. thus, activation of mmps may be one of the distinct host degradative pathways in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. in addition, h7, staurosporine, cycloheximide and tgf-beta could suppress mmp-2 production. agents that target protein synthesis or the protein kinase c pathway in human pdlfs inhibit mmp-2 production, and such inhibition may contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal inflammation. taken together, these findings suggest a possible new therapeutic approach, involving the use of drugs that modify host-response mechanisms to suppress or inhibit mmp-mediated tissue destruction.

TI  == destructive periodontitis lesions are determined by the nature of the lymphocytic response.
AB  == it is now 35 years since brandtzaeg and kraus (1965) published their seminal work entitled "autoimmunity and periodontal disease". initially, this work led to the  concept that destructive periodontitis was a localized hypersensitivity reaction  involving immune complex formation within the tissues. in 1970, ivanyi and lehner highlighted a possible role for cell-mediated immunity, which stimulated a flurry of activity centered on the role of lymphokines such as osteoclast-activating factor (oaf), macrophage-activating factor (maf), macrophage migration inhibition factor (mif), and myriad others. in the late 1970s and early 1980s, attention focused on the role of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and it was thought that periodontal destruction occurred as a series of acute exacerbations. as well, at  this stage doubt was being cast on the concept that there was a neutrophil chemotactic defect in periodontitis patients. once it was realized that neutrophils were primarily protective and that severe periodontal destruction occurred in the absence of these cells, attention swung back to the role of lymphocytes and in particular the regulatory role of t-cells. by this time in the early 1990s, while the roles of interleukin (il)-1, prostaglandin (pg) e(2), and  metalloproteinases as the destructive mediators in periodontal disease were largely understood, the control and regulation of these cytokines remained controversial. with the widespread acceptance of the th1/th2 paradigm, the regulatory role of t-cells became the main focus of attention. two apparently conflicting theories have emerged. one is based on direct observations of human lesions, while the other is based on animal model experiments and the inability to demonstrate il-4 mrna in gingival extracts. as part of the "controversy" series, this review is intended to stimulate debate and hence may appear in some  places provocative. in this context, this review will present the case that destructive periodontitis is due to the nature of the lymphocytic infiltrate and  is not due to periodic acute exacerbations, nor is it due to the so-called virulence factors of putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease: epidemiology and possible mechanisms.
AB  == background: many early epidemiologic studies reported an association between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease. however, other studies found no association or nonsignificant trends. this report summarizes the evidence from epidemiologic studies and studies that focused on potential contributing mechanisms to provide a more complete picture of the association between periodontal and heart disease. types of studies reviewed: the authors summarize the longitudinal studies reported to date, because they represent the highest level of evidence available regarding the connection between periodontal disease  and heart disease. the authors also review many of the case-control and cross-sectional studies published, as well as findings from clinical, animal and  basic laboratory studies. results: the evidence suggests a moderate association--but not a causal relationship--between periodontal disease and heart disease. results of some case-control studies indicate that subgingival periodontal pathogenic infection may be associated with myocardial infarction. basic laboratory studies point to the biological plausibility of this association, since oral bacteria have been found in carotid atheromas and some oral bacteria may be associated with platelet aggregation, an event important for thrombosis. animal studies have shown that atheroma formation can be enhanced by  exposure to periodontal pathogens. conclusions: the accumulation of epidemiologic, in vitro, clinical and animal evidence suggests that periodontal infection may be a contributing risk factor for heart disease. however, legitimate concerns have arisen about the nature of this relationship. these are  early investigations. since even a moderate risk contributed by periodontal disease to heart disease could contribute to significant morbidity and mortality, it is imperative that further studies be conducted to evaluate this relationship. one particularly important study to be carried out is the investigation of a possible clinically meaningful reduction in heart disease resulting from the prevention or treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == in vivo induction of proinflammatory cytokines in mouse tissue by porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease initiated by a multitude of bacteria. persistent infection leads to generation of various inflammatory mediators, resulting in tissue destruction and osteoclastic resorption of the alveolar bone. this study describes a novel in vivo murine calvarial model to assess the effects of oral pathogens on the expression of three proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha] which are involved in bone resorption. we chose porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans as prototype oral pathogens. we also tested  the effects of streptococcus gordonii, an oral commensal supragingival microorganism, considered a non-pathogen. live bacteria were injected into subcutaneous tissue overlying the parietal bone of mice calvaria for 6 days. at the end of the experimental period, tissues overlying the calvaria were removed and analyzed for proinflammatory cytokine expression by northern blotting. cytokine mrna was not detected in the tissue over the calvaria of control animals. in contrast, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans elicited mrna expression of all three cytokines, tnfalpha being the highest (tnfalpha > > il-1beta > il-6). p. gingivalis was more potent than a. actinomycetemcomitans in  inducing cytokine expression. in contrast, s. gordonii induced only low levels of mrna for il-1beta and tnfalpha but no il-6 mrna induction. these results suggest  that oral microorganisms with access to host tissues elicit a battery of proinflammatory cytokines. there were clear differences in profiles and, interestingly, a commensal bacterium also stimulated bone resorptive cytokine expression in host tissues.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == serum igg antibody response to periodontal pathogens in minority populations: relationship to periodontal disease status and progression.
AB  == differences in periodontal disease prevalence, severity, subgingival microflora and host immune response have been reported for various ethnic/racial groups, which implies that risk factors for destructive periodontal disease progression may also vary in these populations. as it is possible that these differences may  be due to confounding variables other than ethnicity/race, we have measured serum igg antibody response to six periodontal pathogens, and compared these data with  microbiological, clinical and demographic parameters in three urban minority populations. the study population consisted of 23 asiatic, 48 african-american and 37 hispanic subjects, who were resident in the greater new york region. clinical indices that were recorded included pocket depth, attachment level, gingival erythema, bleeding upon probing, suppuration and supragingival plaque. attachment level measurements were taken twice at each visit, and the difference  between the means of pairs of measurements taken at baseline and two months later was used to determine disease progression. subgingival microbiological species were identified and enumerated using dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. serum igg antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotyopes a and b, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (elisa). mean serum igg antibody to p. gingivalis was found to be higher in the african-american group, while igg antibody to b. forsythus was lower in the hispanic group. however, the african-american group also had greater mean probing depth, attachment loss, number of missing teeth and numbers of individuals within the unskilled occupational group. when the data were analyzed by occupational status, mean serum igg antibody to p. gingivalis increased from professional to skilled to unskilled groups. for the entire study population, prior disease and subsequent attachment loss were associated with elevated serum igg antibody to p. gingivalis. increasing pocket depth, attachment level, gingival erythema and age  were also positively correlated with serum igg antibody to p. gingivalis, but not with serum igg antibody to the other five subgingival species. no correlation was found between whole-mouth bacterial levels and homologous serum igg antibody levels. these results suggest that elevated serum igg antibody to p. gingivalis reflects destructive periodontal disease status, and may be considered a risk factor for disease progression in these ethnic/racial populations. in addition, although differences in serum igg antibody profiles to subgingival species were found among the three ethnic/racial groups, environmental and socioeconomic variables may have a greater influence on serum igg antibody levels in these populations.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathic bacteria dna from periodontitis-involved gingival tissue using a pcr method].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of periodontopathic bacteria dna in the granulation tissue of periodontally involved gingival tissue. forty periodontitis patients were examined. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were collected from the patients before surgery. then, granulation tissue was also collected during surgery. another 20 patients, who had more than 4 mm in probing pocket depth, were also examined as a control. they received only initial treatment without periodontal surgery. plaque and saliva samples were also collected from them. seven periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, toreponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens, were detected by a pcr method from these samples of all patients. as clinical parameters, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing were recorded. one year after surgery, sampling of subgingival plaque and saliva, and measurement of clinical parameters were performed on the patients. the dna of periodontopathic bacteria was detected in the granulation tissue of 29 out of 40 patients. p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, t. denticola, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected in 23, 11, 12, 9, 3, 2 and 1 subject(s) respectively. the sites with undetectable level of any periodontal pathogens at one year after surgery showed a clinical attachment  gain of 2.44 mm, while those that showed detectable pathogen levels had only a 0.77 mm gain. our results indicated that the removal of granulation tissue contributed to eliminating periodontal pathogens and to avoiding re-infection by  those bacteria. complete eradication of periodontopathic bacteria would be necessary for successful periodontal treatment.

TI  == long-term follow-up of osseointegrated titanium implants using clinical, radiographic and microbiological parameters.
AB  == the aim of this study was to longitudinally follow up osseointegrated titanium implants in partially dentate patients by clinical, radiographic and microbiological parameters in order to evaluate possible changes in the peri-implant health over time. fifteen individuals treated with titanium implants, ad modum branemark, and followed for ten years were included in the study. before implant placement ten years previously, the individuals had been treated for advanced periodontal disease and thereafter been included in a maintenance care program. the survival rate of the implants after ten years was 94.7%. the bone loss was 1.7 mm when using the abutment-fixture junction as a reference point. of the individuals, 50% were positive for plaque at the implants. bleeding on sulcus probing was present at 61% of the implant surfaces.  ten years previously, the individuals had been carriers of putative periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and campylobacter rectus, and were also carriers of these species at the current examination. the results of the present study suggest that the presence of these putative periodontal pathogens at implants may not be associated with an impaired implant  treatment. these species are most likely part of the normal resident microbiota of most individuals and may therefore be found at random at both stable and progressing peri-implant sites.

TI  == clinical, genetic and microbiological findings in a brazilian family with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background/aim: aggressive periodontitis comprises a group of rapidly progressive forms of periodontitis. besides bacteria, a high level of subject susceptibility  must be involved in the expression of disease. in the present study, we report the clinical, microbiological and genetic profile of a 14-individual family with  aggressive periodontitis. method: pcr was utilized to detect pathogenic bacteria  of affected sites. dna was obtained from epithelial cells through a mouthwash with 3% glucose and scrapping of the oral mucosa. rflp-pcr was used to analyze cytokine genetic polymorphisms. results: localized aggressive periodontitis was diagnosed for an 18-year-old systemically healthy non-smoking proband, with siblings displaying aggressive periodontitis. bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola were the most frequent pathogens. the proband presented actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans and detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. allele 2 of il-1alpha (-889) polymorphism was found in all individuals as well as allele 1 of the il-1beta (+3953) gene. alleles 1 and 2 (50 % each) of il-1beta (-511), allele 1 of tnf-alpha (-308) and allele 2 (in homo or heterozygosity) of il-rn (intron 2) gene were present. conclusion: the results show that the present microbiological  and genetic parameters were not relevant for the prediction of periodontitis susceptibility in this family.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == oral bacteria and respiratory infection: effects on respiratory pathogen adhesion and epithelial cell proinflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == several microbiologic and epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between dental plaque, poor oral health, and respiratory diseases such as nosocomial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). a number of hypotheses are suggested to help explain how oral bacteria may participate in  the pathogenesis of respiratory infection. resident bacteria in oral secretions are likely aspirated along with respiratory pathogens and may affect the adhesion of the later organisms to the respiratory epithelium. preliminary studies performed in our laboratory suggest that oral bacteria may modulate the adhesion  of respiratory pathogens to epithelial cell lines. in addition, oral bacterial products or cytokines in oral/pharyngeal aspirates may stimulate cytokine production from respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells. the resulting inflamed epithelium may be more susceptible to  respiratory infection. further preliminary data are presented that some species of oral bacteria may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cell lines to an extent similar to that seen for respiratory pathogens.

TI  == effect of the enamel matrix derivative emdogain on the growth of periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of emdogain (emd), used for periodontal regeneration, on the growth of periodontal pathogens like actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. for comparison, we studied the effect of emd on several microbes associated with other oral diseases as well as its effect on non-pathogenic oral  inhabitants. methods: freshly prepared emd or its vehicle propylene glycol alginate (pga) alone were added to calibrated suspensions of microbes. as a control, imitating the post-surgical subgingival situation after flap closure, a  serum/nacl-solution mixture was used. aliquots for growth assays were taken at scheduled times for calculation of colony-forming units and cell densities over an observation period of 24 h. additionally, emd was spotted onto selected, newly seeded microbes growing on agar plates to see if growth inhibition zones could be produced. results: the study revealed a marked inhibitory effect of emd on the growth of the gram-negative periodontal pathogens. a. actinomycetemcomitans showed a significant decrease (p=0.012) in viable counts after 24 h when emd was  added at baseline. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia also showed a marked growth reduction in the presence of emd and in these cultures no viable microbes could be detected anymore after 24 h. in contrast, no significant growth inhibition was observed in gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: the results suggest that emd has a positive effect on the composition of bacterial species in the post-surgical periodontal wound, by selectively restricting growth of periopathogens that could hamper the wound healing and reduce the outcome of regenerative procedures.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == multiserotype enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as a diagnostic aid for periodontitis in large-scale studies.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic oral infection caused by gram-negative bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. periodontitis evokes inflammatory host response locally in the periodontium but also systemically. the systemic humoral antibody response against oral pathogens can conveniently be measured by an immunoassay. the aim of the study was to measure serum immunoglobulin g class antibodies against a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) in which mixtures of several serotypes of the pathogens were used as antigens to avoid biasing of the results in favor of a particular strain. for a.  actinomycetemcomitans the antigen consisted of six strains representing serotypes a, b, c, d, and e and one nonserotypeable strain. in the p. gingivalis elisa, antigens representing serotypes a, b, and c were used. serum samples from 90 subjects, including 35 samples from patients with diagnosed periodontitis, 10 samples from periodontally healthy controls, and 45 samples from randomly selected apparently healthy volunteers (referred to as "healthy subjects"), were  tested. for both pathogens the antibody levels (means +/- standard deviations) of the patients--xpressed as area under the dilution curve--were significantly higher than those for healthy controls or healthy subjects, with values for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, respectively, as follows: patients, 22.60 +/- 9.94 mm(2) and 26.72 +/- 11.13 mm(2); healthy controls, 9.99 +/- 3.92 mm(2) and 6.90 +/- 3.38 mm(2); and healthy subjects, 16.85 +/- 6.67 mm(2) and 8.51 +/- 4.23 mm(2). the serotype mixture elisa is suitable for measuring antibodies against periodontal pathogens in large epidemiological studies in order to evaluate the role of periodontitis as a risk factor for other diseases.

TI  == the microbiota of young children from tooth and tongue samples.
AB  == this study determined the frequency with which 38 microbial species were detected in 171 randomly selected children from 6 to 36 months of age. children were sampled and dental caries measured. oral samples were assayed by means of a checkerboard dna probe assay. the detection frequencies from tongue samples in children under 18 mos were: s. mutans 70%, s. sobrinus 72%, p. gingivalis 23%, b. forsythus 11%, and a. actinomycetemcomitans 30%, with similar detection frequencies in children over 18 mos. thus, s. mutans and the periodontal pathogens, p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, were detected even in the youngest subjects. species associated with caries included s. mutans (children ages 18-36  mos) and a. israelii (children ages < 18 mos), the latter species possibly reflecting increased plaque in children with caries. species detection from tooth and tongue samples was highly associated, with most species detected more frequently from tongue than from tooth samples in children under 18 mos, suggesting that the tongue was a potential microbial reservoir.

TI  == general health risk of periodontal disease.
AB  == the possibility that periodontal disease might influence the morbidity and mortality of systemic diseases constitutes a research topic of great current interest. human periodontal disease is associated with a complex microbiota containing approximately 500 microbial taxa and various human viruses, many of which possess significant virulence potential. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria that are unique to the oral cavity and may disseminate to other body sites comprise the best-documented form of dental focal infection. however, systemically healthy individuals seem to be at low risk of acquiring acute non-oral diseases from direct infections by periodontal pathogens. research data  from various laboratories point to periodontal infections as a risk factor for chronic medical disorders, including cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accidents and low-birth-weight infants. however, recent epidemiological studies have failed to show a significant relationship between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease. this review paper evaluates the current status of knowledge on dental focal infection and suggests avenues for further research into the topic of general health risks of periodontal disease.

TI  == the association between porphyromonas gingivalis-specific maternal serum igg and  low birth weight.
AB  == background: in alabama, low birth weight (lbw) infants are about 20 times more likely to die before their first birthday compared to normal birth weight infants. while the rate of lbw has been consistently higher among african americans compared to whites, there has been a gradual increase in lbw for both african americans and whites over the last 15 years. in an attempt to identify modifiable risk factors for lbw, we have previously reported that a pregnant woman's poor periodontal health may be an independent risk factor for low birth weight. methods: a predominantly african american and socioeconomically homogeneous group of 448 women was followed from the second trimester of their first pregnancy. thirty-nine lbw cases were observed at the end of follow-up. using 17 preterm lbw cases and 63 randomly selected controls from the above cohort, the periodontal pathogen-specific maternal serum igg levels during the second trimester of pregnancy were evaluated in relation to birth weight of the infant, while controlling for known risk factors for lbw. results: porphyromonas  gingivalis (p.g.)-specific maternal serum igg levels were higher in the lbw group (mean 58.05, se = 20.00 microg/ml) compared to the normal birth weight (nbw) group (mean 13.45, se = 3.92 microg/ml; p= 0.004). women with higher levels of p.g.-specific igg had higher odds of giving birth to lbw infants (odds ratio [or] = 4.1; 95% confidence interval [ci] for odds ratio = 1.3 to 12.8). this association remained significant after controlling for smoking, age, igg levels against other selected periodontal pathogens, and race. conclusions: low birth weight deliveries were associated with a higher maternal serum antibody level against p. gingivalis at mid-trimester.

TI  == associations between serum antibody levels to periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == background: the role of antibodies to periodontal microorganisms in the development of periodontal tissue destruction is still unclear. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum levels of igg, iga, and igm antibodies to 6 periodontal microorganisms and clinical subtypes of varying severity of early-onset periodontitis (eop) in young african american adults. methods: the study group consisted of 159 african americans aged 19 to 25 years (mean 22 years) and included 97 cases with eop and 62 controls with no clinical signs of eop. these subjects were selected from a nationally representative sample of adolescents who received an oral examination as part of the national survey of oral health of united states children in 1986-1987. the group was examined clinically a second time 6 years later and blood samples were collected. serum levels of igg, iga, and igm reactive to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum were assessed. results: serum levels of igg and iga antibody reactive to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans and iga antibody to p. intermedia were significantly higher in generalized eop cases compared to healthy controls. igm antibody levels did not show any significant associations with eop for any of the 6 bacterial species tested. there were no significant differences in antibody levels between  controls and the 13 subjects in our study who were classified with localized eop. conclusions: the findings suggest that antibodies to p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of eop. substantial longitudinal studies that monitor antibody levels and avidity prior to disease onset, during progression, and following clinical intervention will be necessary to fully understand the role of this component of the immune response in protection versus tissue destruction and the  potential use in eop risk assessment and disease management.

AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. to investigate the roles of tlrs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a chinese hamster ovary (cho) nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both tlr2- and tlr4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human cd14 and tlrs. when the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, and fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced nf-kappab-dependent cd25 expression in  7.7/hutlr2 cells. although freeze-dried a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, freeze-dried p. gingivalis did not. similarly, lipopolysaccharides (lps) extracted from a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, but lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea did not. furthermore, lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea attenuated cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells induced by repurified lps from e. coli. lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (il-6) from u373 cells, the secretion of il-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and icam-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified lps from e. coli. these findings indicated that lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea worked as antagonists for human tlr4. the antagonistic activity of lps from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.

AB  == in this longitudinal study, five adult down's syndrome patients with periodontitis were placed on a frequent recall visit schedule (every 6 weeks) after treatment, in order to investigate: 1) the microbiological status, both supragingivally and subgingivally, and the changes that occurred after treatment  and 2) the effect of frequent professional supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota and clinical variables in these patients. the clinical variables recorded were probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, bleeding  on probing and presence of plaque (full mouth, six surfaces per tooth). microbiological examination was performed separately for supragingival and subgingival samples from the same site for 14 species, using whole genomic dna probes and the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique. the findings indicate that, although a reduction of periodontal indices was noticed, plaque levels remained high (60%) even at the end of the experimental period. periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently detected both supragingivally and subgingivally (>30%). the presence of a species supragingivally and the presence at the same time points subgingivally were correlated. this finding suggested that supragingival plaque acts as a reservoir  for reinfection of treated sites. a reduction of the percentages of detection of  these species was noticed 1 month after an oral hygiene period as well as at 3 and 6 months after treatment. inadequate oral hygiene as performed by these patients probably affected supragingival, and consequently subgingival, plaque composition.

TI  == association between betel quid chewing, periodontal status and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the present investigation examined whether an association exists between betel quid chewing and signs of periodontal disease and determined the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis by polymerase chain reaction. the periodontal status of 34 betel quid chewers and 32 non-betel  quid chewers were compared. a significantly higher prevalence of bleeding on probing was found in betel quid chewers than non-chewers among the subjects with  higher plaque level, greater gingival inflammation, deeper probing depth or greater attachment loss. also, the results suggested that betel quid chewers may  harbor higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis than non-betel quid chewers. the association persists after adjusting for severity of the clinical parameters. in conclusion, betel quid chewing was associated with a higher prevalence of bleeding on probing where higher clinical  levels of disease existed, and with a likelihood of subgingival infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis.

TI  == distribution of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in an australian population.
AB  == background/aim: the present study describes (i) the natural distribution of the three putative periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in an australian population and (ii) the relationship between these organisms, pocket depths and supragingival plaque scores. methods: subgingival plaque was collected from the shallowest and deepest probing site in each sextant of the dentition. in total, 6030 subgingival plaque samples were collected from 504 subjects. an elisa utilising pathogen-specific monoclonal antibodies was used to quantitate bacterial numbers. results: : a. actinomycetemcomitans was the most frequently detected organism (22.8% of subjects) followed by p. gingivalis and p. intermedia (14.7% and 9.5% of subjects respectively). the majority of infected subjects (83%) were colonised by a single species of organism. a. actinomycetemcomitans presence was over-represented in the youngest age group but under-represented in  the older age groups. conversely, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia presence was under-represented in the youngest age group but over-represented in the older age groups. differing trends in the distribution of these bacteria were observed between subjects depending upon the site of the infection or whether a single or  mixed infection was present; however, these differences did not reach significance. bacterial presence was strongly associated with pocket depth for both a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis. for a. actinomycetemcomitans, the odds of a site containing this bacterium decrease with deeper pockets. in contrast, for p. gingivalis the odds of a site being positive are almost six times greater for pockets >3 mm than for pockets < or =3 mm. these odds increase  further to 15.3 for pockets deeper than 5 mm. the odds of a site being p. intermedia positive were marginally greater (1.16) for pockets deeper than 3 mm.  conclusions: this cross-sectional study in a volunteer australian population, demonstrated recognised periodontal pathogens occur as part of the flora of the subgingival plaque. prospective longitudinal studies are needed to examine the positive relationship between pocket depth and pathogen presence with periodontal disease initiation and/or progression.

TI  == sulfate-reducing bacteria in relation with other potential periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background, aims: oral sulfate-reducing bacteria are involved in several clinical categories of periodontitis. the aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) with other putative pathogens including spirochetes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola in periodontal lesions. method: periodontal srb were detected by enrichment culture and compared with a microscopic spirochete count (n=168). species-specific oligonucleotide probes directed against the 16s rrna were employed to determine the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and t. denticola (n=55). results: a significant positive correlation was observed between the presence of  srb and the proportions of spirochetes in subgingival plaque, although the 2 bacterial groups also occurred separately. srb tended to be negatively correlated with the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. in contrast, all pockets with srb  harbored either t. denticola, or both t. denticola and b. forsythus (12/14) before therapy. interestingly, the combination of srb with p. gingivalis occurred in 32% of the periodontal pockets before treatment. after initial periodontal therapy, the prevalence of this combination was reduced to 2% of the sites, and to 25% of the sites in recall patients. conclusion: the presence of srb was positively correlated with t. denticola, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis in periodontal lesions. these suspected pathogens form a complex strongly associated with destructive periodontitis.

TI  == a longitudinal study of interleukin-1 gene polymorphisms and periodontal disease  in a general adult population.
AB  == background: cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that a specific polymorphism (allele 2 of both il-1a +4845 and il-1b +3954) in the il-1 gene cluster has been associated with an increased susceptibility to severe periodontal disease and to an increased bleeding tendency during periodontal maintenance. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between il-1 genotype and periodontitis in a prospective longitudinal study in an adult population of essentially european heritage. methods: from an ongoing study of the oral care research programme of the university of queensland, 295 subjects consented to genotyping for il-1 allele 2 polymorphisms. probing depths and relative attachment levels were recorded at baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months using the florida probe. periodontitis progression at a given site was defined as attachment loss > or =2 mm at any observation period during the 5 years of the study and the extent of disease progression determined by the number of sites showing attachment loss. porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected using elisa. results: 38.9% of the subjects were positive for the composite il-1 genotype. a relationship between the il-1 positive genotype and increased mean probing pocket depth in non-smokers greater than 50 years of age was found. further, il-1 genotype positive smokers and genotype positive subjects with p. gingivalis in their plaque had an increase in the number of probing depths > or =3.5 mm. there  was a consistent trend for il-1 genotype positive subjects to experience attachment loss when compared with il-1 genotype negative subjects. conclusion: the results of this study have shown an interaction of the il-1 positive genotype with age, smoking and p. gingivalis which suggests that il-1 genotype is a contributory but non-essential risk factor for periodontal disease progression in this population.

TI  == intra- and interspecies regulation of gene expression by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans luxs.
AB  == the cell density-dependent control of gene expression is employed by many bacteria for regulating a variety of physiological functions, including the generation of bioluminescence, sporulation, formation of biofilms, and the expression of virulence factors. although periodontal organisms do not appear to  secrete acyl-homoserine lactone signals, several species, e.g., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been shown to secrete a signal related to the autoinducer ii (ai-2) of the signal system 2 pathway in vibrio harveyi. here, we report that the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses a homolog of v. harveyi luxs and secretes an ai-2-like signal. cell-free conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from a recombinant escherichia coli strain (e. coli ais) expressing a. actinomycetemcomitans luxs induced luminescence in v. harveyi bb170 >200-fold over controls. ai-2 levels peaked in mid-exponential-phase cultures of  a. actinomycetemcomitans and were significantly reduced in late-log- and stationary-phase cultures. incubation of early-log-phase a. actinomycetemcomitans cells with conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from e. coli ais resulted in a threefold induction of leukotoxic activity and a concomitant increase in leukotoxin polypeptide. in contrast, no increase in leukotoxin expression occurred when cells were exposed to sterile medium or to conditioned broth from e. coli ais(-), a recombinant strain in which luxs was insertionally inactivated. a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 also induced expression of afua, encoding a periplasmic iron transport protein, approximately eightfold, suggesting that luxs-dependent signaling may play a role in the regulation of iron acquisition by a. actinomycetemcomitans. finally, a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 added in trans complemented a luxs knockout mutation in p. gingivalis by modulating the expression of the luxs-regulated genes uvrb and hasf in this organism. together, these results suggest that luxs-dependent signaling may modulate aspects of virulence and the uptake of iron by a. actinomycetemcomitans  and induce responses in other periodontal organisms in mixed-species oral biofilm.

TI  == non-redundant roles for interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta in regulating  human igg2.
AB  == background: serum concentrations of immunoglobulin g2 (igg2) are elevated in localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) patients, and secretory products of monocytes from lagp patients enhance igg2 responses of lymphocytes from healthy subjects. furthermore, genes regulating production of interleukin (il)-1 influence the risk for both aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis. these observations, and the fact that igg2 dominates responses to  carbohydrates from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, prompted the hypothesis that il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, and il-ra may help regulate human igg2 responses. methods: human peripheral blood leukocytes (pbl) were stimulated in culture with pokeweed mitogen (pwm); the levels of available il-1 gene products were manipulated; and the effect on igg2 production  was monitored. manipulations of il-1 were accomplished by adding specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or recombinant il-1ra, il-1 alpha, or il-1 beta. results: blocking the il-1 receptor with il-1ra or neutralizing il-1 alpha  or il-1 beta with specific antibody dramatically suppressed igg2 production (50%  to 70%). additionally il-1 alpha did not compensate for neutralized il-1 beta, and additional il-1 beta did not compensate for neutralized il-1 alpha, suggesting the 2 monokines have separate roles in promoting igg2. furthermore, combinations of anti-il-1 alpha and anti-il-1 beta were more inhibitory than either antibody alone, and il-1 alpha and il-1 beta in combination appeared to work additively in promoting igg2. moreover, pbl cultures from a group of lagp patients with high igg2 levels had elevated levels of il-1 beta. conclusion: il-1 alpha and il-1 beta appear to have critical and non-redundant roles in the generation and regulation of potent igg2 responses, which appear to be important  in human responses to carbohydrate-bearing bacteria.

TI  == generalized cervical root resorption associated with periodontal disease.
AB  == background and description of case: the etiology and pathogenesis of generalized  cervical root resorptions is not well understood. in the present report, a case of severe cervical root resorption involving 24 anterior and posterior teeth is presented. the lesions developed within a period of 2 years after the patient had changed to an acid-enriched diet. they extended far into the coronal dentin and were associated with gingival inflammation and crestal bone resorption. however,  no generalized clinical attachment loss had occurred. culturing of subgingival plaque revealed the presence of several putative periodontal pathogens among which actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. treatment consisted of mechanical debridement supported by systemic antibiotics (amoxycillin plus metronidazole) and dietary advice. results: within 1 year after the onset of treatment, all resorptive lesions had repaired by ingrowth of a radio-opaque mineralized tissue. the crestal areas showed radiological evidence of bone repair. 3 years after the onset of therapy, one premolar was extracted and examined histologically. it appeared that irregularly-shaped masses of woven  bone-like tissue had invaded into the domain of the resorbed coronal dentin and were bordered by thin layers of acellular cementum. conclusion: it is concluded that, in this patient, the cervical resorptions were likely the result of an osteoclastic response extending into the roots because the root-protective role of the junctional epithelium did not develop. we hypothesize that this was due to the combined effects of a periodontopathogenic microflora and a dietary confounding factor.

TI  == absence of a specific subgingival microflora in adults with down's syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontal disease in down's syndrome (ds) is generally characterized by a high degree of bone loss. bone loss of 5 mm or more is observed in 70% of these subjects. among ds subjects, considerable differences in disease progression occur. so far, no studies have been conducted in which specific properties of the subgingival microflora have been related to the condition observed. aims: to investigate (1) the subgingival microflora in ds subjects and other mentally retarded (control) individuals which were matched to  the utmost and (2) to investigate the subgingival microflora of a "low-risk" and  a " high-risk" group formed in ds subjects. material and methods: 17 ds subjects  and 17 control subjects were matched with respect to age, plaque level and bleeding on probing. in addition, the ds group was divided in a "low-risk" group  (0-2 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=6) and a "high-risk"group (6-13 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=11). prevalence and proportions of the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus in the subgingival plaque were determined using anaerobic culture techniques. no differences in the prevalence of distinct suspected periodontopathic bacteria and bacterial subgingival composition between the ds group and the control group could be established. also no differences in the prevalence of the seven investigated microbial species between the "low-risk" and the "high-risk" group were observed. conclusions: because of the lack of differences in microflora between the ds group and the control group, a specific effect of the microbiological composition in the periodontal status of subjects with ds can be  excluded in this population. host factors constitute the more likely explanation  of the differences observed in ds.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == polymorphisms of the interleukin-1 gene family, oral microbial pathogens, and smoking in adult periodontitis.
AB  == interleukin (il)-1alpha, il-1beta, and il-1ra contribute to regulation of the inflammatory response in periodontal tissues. we aimed to investigate the distribution of polymorphisms in the il-1 gene family among periodontitis patients and controls, taking into account smoking and microbiology as additional variables. fifty-three non-smoking and 52 smoking patients with severe adult periodontitis and 53 controls were genotyped for bi-allelic il-1a(-889), il-1b(-3954), and a penta-allelic 86-bp vntr il-1rn gene polymorphisms. the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was established by culture techniques. we found a higher frequency of allele 2 carriage in il-1a, il-1b, and il-1rn in periodontitis patients who were non-smokers and in whom p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans could not be detected (42.1% vs. 11.3% in controls; p = 0.0068; or 5.7, 95% ci: 1.6-19.8). our results provide evidence that polymorphisms in genes of the il-1 family are associated with severe adult periodontitis in the absence of other risk factors tested in this patient population.

TI  == the effects of toothpastes on the residual microbial contamination of toothbrushes.
AB  == background: contaminated toothbrushes have been shown to harbor and transmit viruses and bacteria. the authors conducted a study to evaluate the effect of a triclosan-containing toothpaste on the residual anaerobic microbial contamination of toothbrushes. methods: twenty patients who had type iii or type iv periodontitis participated in this study. one side of each of their mouths served as a control (no toothpaste). the teeth on the other side were brushed with a regular toothpaste or a triclosan-containing toothpaste. after the toothbrushes were allowed to dry in air for four hours, the authors placed the toothbrush heads in solution, dislodged the microbes from the brushes by vortexing and plated them in culture dishes. the authors anerobically incubated the culture dishes and determined the presence or absence of prevotella species or ps; porphyromonas gingivalis, or pg; and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, or aa. results: the authors detected aa and pg on the control toothbrushes more frequently than they did ps. this variation in isolation frequency was statistically significant by chi 2 analysis (p < .001). the authors compared the  isolation frequency of the three test organisms between the control and regular-toothpaste groups, between the control and triclosan-containing--toothpaste groups, and between the triclosan-containing--toothpaste and regular-toothpaste groups. they found no significant intergroup differences in the isolation frequencies after using chi 2 analysis. conclusions: toothpaste use reduced the residual microbial contamination for two of three test organisms, but the lower isolation frequencies were not statistically significant. further study in this area is indicated. clinical implications: dental professionals should advise patients who have systemic, localized or oral inflammatory diseases to disinfect or frequently replace their toothbrushes.

TI  == [clinical and microbiological study of adult periodontal disease].
AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a microbiological evaluation of sites with and without clinical evidence of moderate and severe periodontitis and their correlation with clinical parameters. a total of 52 disease sites and 10 healthy  sites were selected according to clinical criteria. the following clinical indexes were measured for all the sites: plaque index, gingival index, blood on probing, depth on probing and insertion level. samples of subgingival plaque were collected for culture and for differential counts of microbial morphotypes. in disease sites the most frequently isolated were: prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (65%), porphyromonas gingivalis (23%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10%) and peptostreptococcus sp. (31%). the aerobic gram-positive microflora was predominant in healthy sites. significant differences were observed in microbial morphotypes between healthy and disease sites: cocci 18.71% and 78.90%, motile rods 46.12% and 16.70%, total spirochetes  26.48% and 2.80%, respectively. the presence of motile rods, spirochetes and p. intermedia/nigrescens were the parameters with most sensitivity to suspect periodontal disease. there were significant differences in the subgingival microflora between healthy and disease sites in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.

TI  == effects of smoking and treatment status on periodontal bacteria: evidence that smoking influences control of periodontal bacteria at the mucosal surface of the  gingival crevice.
AB  == background: we examined whether smoking status could influence growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal environment of treated and untreated periodontal patients. methods: we have previously reported effects of treatment status on marker bacteria in our patients. we established a history of  any smoking during 6 months prior to microbiological sampling (f-me, 16 smokers out of 64; mhm, 70 smokers out of 185). we used a commercial immunoassay to quantitate porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in paper point samples from periodontal sites. results: logistic regression showed that in smokers, neither p. gingivalis nor a. actinomycetemcomitans was quantitatively increased, while p intermedia was somewhat increased. multiple regression demonstrated that smoking disrupts the positive relationship between increasing probing depth and increasing bacterial growth that is found in non-smokers. in smokers, growth of marker bacteria at shallow sites (< or =5 mm) was significantly increased to the levels found at deeper sites (>5 mm) in both smokers and non-smokers. supragingival plaque biofilm was identified as a reservoir for marker bacteria; smokers and nonsmokers had equal ranges of oral cleanliness. conclusions: smoking-associated periodontitis is not simply a reflection of oral cleanliness. smoking extends a favorable habitat for bacteria such as p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans to shallow sites (< or =5 mm). molecular byproducts of smoking interfere with mechanisms that normally contain growth of damaging bacteria at the surface of the oral mucosa in gingival crevices. in this way, smoking can promote early development of periodontal lesions.

AB  == background: we employed a commercial immunoassay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of marker bacteria actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia and reassessed the immunochemical performance of the assay. methods: we compared the analytical performance of the immunoassay in our study of clinical samples from 249 periodontal patients in 2 private periodontal practices with the previously reported analytical performance of the same immunoassay. we also compared immunoassay measurements of the marker bacteria in clinical samples with values obtained in other studies by direct culture of the same organisms. results: the assay produced 3 times more high-end readings than reported previously. we also reassessed and revised previously published calibration curves for the immunoassay. the immunoassay provided measurements of the marker bacteria in clinical samples from our patients that were comparable to and consistent with measurements of the same bacteria by direct culture in other studies. conclusions: we ascribe the increased sensitivity of the immunoassay in our study to: 1) a more standardized and vigorous sample dispersion that improves release of particulate and soluble antigens from dental plaque biofilm, and 2) better visualization of the reaction product of the enzyme-linked immunoassay. high-technology assays, such as diagnostic immunoassays, have a significant potential for future development in dental diagnosis, because they simplify detection and measurement of biologically important markers such as specific bacteria in clinical samples. commercial assays also have an important potential  for standardization of clinical measurements of biological markers.

AB  == objective: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) has been implicated as an important pathogen in periodontal disease. the aim of this  report is to examine the effect of in vitro application of a. actinomycetemcomitans protease on the cell growth, dna synthesis, and fibronectin level of human gingival epithelial cells. materials and methods: a. actinomycetemcomitans protease was isolated from the culture supernatant of a. actinomycetemcomitans. human gingival epithelial cells were incubated in the presence or absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans protease (0.01, 0.1, or i u) for  48 h. the proliferation of cells were tested with the mtt assay and the brdu assay. the fibronectin level was examined by flow cytometric analysis. results: the cell growth rate, dna synthesis rate, and fibronectin level of the gingival epithelial cells that had been incubated with protease, were lower than the respective values in the untreated gingival epithelial cells; as the dose of a. actinomycetemcomitans protease increased, the cell growth rate, dna synthesis rate, and fibronectin level of the gingival epithelial cells decreased. a. actinomycetemcomitans protease may inhibit the proliferation of human gingival epithelial cells. conclusions: this protease may play a key role as a major virulence factor in the development of periodontal disease.

AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the clinical significance of antibiotic therapy combined with guided tissue regeneration (gtr) therapy with a collagen membrane. the subjects were 20 adults diagnosed with periodontitis (20 intrabony  periodontal defects). ten patients were treated with gtr alone (control group) and the other 10 patients were treated with a combination of gtr and antibiotics  (antibiotic group). in the antibiotic group, minocycline ointment was applied locally before gtr therapy, and doxycycline and amoxyline were systemically administered after gtr therapy. clinical manifestations, the presence or absence  of exposed membrane, and microbiological findings were assessed 1 month before, immediately after, and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months after gtr therapy. the results showed no significant differences in reduction of probing depth, probing  attachment gain (pag), or the ratio of pag to intraoperative depth of the intrabony defect (vertical relative attachment gain) between the antibiotic group and the control group before and 3 months after gtr therapy. a dna probe test and specific enzymatic activity test revealed no significant differences in the improvement and the rate of bacterial negativity before, and 6 weeks and 3 months after, gtr therapy. these findings indicate that antibiotic therapy is not clinically beneficial when combined with gtr therapy with a collagen membrane.

TI  == humoral immune response in early-onset periodontitis: influence of smoking.
AB  == sixty-five patients with generalised early-onset periodontitis (g-eop) (age range 16-42 years, 32 smokers and 33 non-smokers) were assessed for antibody titres and avidity to a panel of five suspected periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus). thirty-four of these patients were untreated (17 smokers and 17 non-smokers), and thirty-one were in the maintenance phase of periodontal therapy (15 smokers and 16 non-smokers). previous studies have investigated the effect of smoking on igg levels in periodontitis patients in the context of the more extensive periodontal destruction seen in smokers. based on this literature our hypothesis was that smokers would have depressed serum igg levels directed against recognised periodontal pathogens compared with non-smokers. antibody titres were measured by elisa deploying fixed whole cells as coating. the igg response was detected with  biotin-anti-human igg and avidin-peroxidase; avidity was determined by elution with ammonium thiocyanate. median titres to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and t. denticola were significantly lower in maintenance patient smokers (p= 0.02, 0.02 and 0.002 respectively) but not in untreated patients. avidity to p. gingivalis was also lower in smoking maintenance patients (p = 0.003) but not in untreated patients. these findings may imply some interruption  of immune maturation in smokers following periodontal treatment.

AB  == objectives: this study examined the occurrence of human herpes viruses and suspected periodontopathic bacteria in early-onset periodontitis patients who experienced progressive disease in at least 2 periodontal sites during the maintenance phase of therapy. material and methods: in each of 16 individuals (9  male and 7 female; mean age 33.1+/-2.6 years), subgingival plaque samples were collected from 2 deteriorating and 2 stable periodontitis sites. a nested polymerase chain reaction method determined the presence of human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus type 1 (ebv-1) and herpes simplex virus (hsv). a 16s rrna polymerase chain reaction method identified porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, bacteroides forsythus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: hcmv was detected in 59.4% of active and in 12.5% of stable sites (p<0.001), ebv-1 in 43.8% of active and in 12.5 % of stable sites (p=0.01), hsv in 34.5% of active and in 9.4% of stable sites (p=0.03), and co-infection with any of the 3 test herpesviruses in 43.8% of active and in 3.1%  of stable sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis was detected in 71.9% of active and in 37.5% of stable sites (p=0.01), d. pneumosintes in 62.5% of active and in 18.8% of stable sites (p=0.04), co-infection with p. gingivalis and d. pneumosintes in  50% of active and in 0% of stable sites (p<0.001), and co-infection with any 3 or 4 of the test bacteria in 40.6% of active and in 0% of stable sites (p=0.001). all periodontitis sites showing herpesvirus co-infection and all but one site showing p. gingivalis and d. pneumosintes co-infection revealed bleeding upon probing. conclusions: hcmv, ebv-1, hsv and herpesvirus co-infection, as well as p. gingivalis, d. pneumosintes and p. gingivalis-d. pneumosintes co-infection were statistically associated with active periodontitis. herpesviruses are immunosuppressive and may set the stage for overgrowth of subgingival p. gingivalis, d. pneumosintes and other periodontopathic bacteria. understanding the significance of herpesviruses in human periodontitis may allow for improved diagnosis, more specific therapy and, ultimately, disease prevention.

TI  == detection of putative oral pathogens in acute periradicular abscesses by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic  origin. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain  reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. porphyromonas endodontalis was found  in 70%, t. denticola in 50%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis. prevotella nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.

TI  == [bacteriologic investigation of periodontal infections].
AB  == the gingivitis and periodontitis are very common diseases in hungary: more than 80% of the adult population suffers with gingivitis and 15-20% has destructive periodontitis. the composition of peridontopathogenic bacterial flora is totally  different from that of the bacterial flora causing dental infections. in periodontal infections dominantly facultative and obligatory anaerobic microorganisms occur (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), bacteroides forsythus (b. forsythus). the main objective of the study was to investigate the  microbial flora of the rapidly progressing periodontitis with special respect to  the occurrence of the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the antibiotic susceptibility of the a. actinomycetemcomitans was also determined against the most frequently used conventional antibiotics. twenty-five samples collected from patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis were examined. prevalence and ratio of a. actinomycetemcomitans and other species of the periodontal anaerobic  flora were investigated. mic values of different antibiotics used routinely--clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, tetracycline, metronidazole--were measured. prevalence of black pigmented bacteroides (50%), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (30%) was comparable to data of foreign investigators. a. actinomycetemcomitans spp. appear to be more sensitive to clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and more resistant to metronidazole compared to published data. the knowledge of microbial composition of the periodontal flora could help to diagnose the different forms of periodontitis. it can also assist the indication of the most appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == elevated mrna expression for supervillin and vascular endothelial growth factor in human neutrophils stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == differential gene expression was examined in human neutrophils stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis-lps) using rna fingerprinting by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (rap-pcr). lps from escherichia coli (e. coli-lps) was used as control. more than 200 differently expressed transcripts were found in 8 subjects showing differential regulation at the transcriptional level. densitometric analyses revealed that 42-100 genes were upregulated, while 53-116 genes were downregulated by p. gingivalis-lps compared with e. coli-lps. the results of sequencing identification showed the presence of supervillin (svil) and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) genes in the clones which were upregulated by p. gingivalis-lps. consequently, semiquantitative analyses proved that the level of  mrna for svil and vegf were significantly higher in p. gingivalis-lps-stimulated  neutrophils than in other bacterial (e. coli, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia) lps- or synthetic lipid a-stimulated neutrophils. our findings suggest that an elevated mrna expression for svil could be associated with impaired function of neutrophils when stimulated by p. gingivalis-lps. further, the vegf mrna over-expression might be  related to the pathogenesis of p. gingivalis-associated periodontitis. the rap-pcr technique used in this study enabled us to identify a number of p. gingivalis-lps regulated genes which hitherto have not been reported.

TI  == on the symmetry of periodontal disease.
AB  == background/aim: symmetry is a common feature of biological systems, and can be observed in multiple aspects of the human body. the purpose of this study was to  estimate the impact of symmetry on variance observed in intraoral topographic distribution patterns of chronic periodontitis. method: this analysis was performed on a data set from 56 subjects, including clinical and microbiological  variables, recorded at the mesial and distal aspect of every tooth in the entire  dentition. the impact of contralateral conditions was determined on the level of  the site, the tooth, and the quadrant. results: significant correlations were detected between probing depths, recession, attachment levels, total cultivable bacterial counts and the plaque index recorded on the right and left side on all  levels of analysis. the odds for bleeding on sampling, as well as for the presence of p. intermedia/nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans increased significantly if the respective contralateral site was positive for the same parameter. in combining ipsilateral and contralateral parameters into the analysis it could be shown in several instances that this contralateral effect was stronger than the impact of other, ipsilateral factors. as an example, the odds for bleeding on sampling increased up to 10 fold if the contralateral site was bleeding, whereas the ipsilateral total cultivable count, determined at the same site, explained less than 30% of the variation in the bleeding tendency. conclusion: these findings support the view that the development of periodontal disease in any site cannot be explained by the influence of local detrimental factors alone.

TI  == influence of surface modifications to titanium on antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == the antibacterial effect of surface modifications to titanium on porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 was evaluated. surface modifications were performed with dry processes including ion  implantation (ca+, n+, f+), oxidation (anode oxidation, titania spraying), ion plating (tin, alumina), and ion beam mixing (ag, sn, zn, pt) with ar+ on polished pure titanium plates. f+-implanted specimens significantly inhibited the growth of both p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans than the polished titanium. the other surface-modified specimens did not exhibit effective antibacterial activity against both bacteria. no release of the fluorine ion was detected from  f-implanted specimens under dissolution testing. this result and the characterization of the f+-implanted surfaces suggested that the possible antibacterial mechanism of the f+-implanted specimen was caused by the formation  of a metal fluoride complex on the surfaces. in addition, f+-implanted surfaces did not inhibit the proliferation of fibroblast l929-cells. these findings indicate that surface modification by means of a dry process is useful in providing antibacterial activity of oral bacteria to titanium implants exposed to the oral cavity.

TI  == mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  == background: the etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. this implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. however, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. objective: to investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. the subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans  streptococci. this localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. materials and methods:  in this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. these patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. results: the prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. the mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). conclusions: the subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.

TI  == untreated periodontal disease in indonesian adolescents. subgingival microbiota in relation to experienced progression of periodontitis.
AB  == background/aims: in an indonesian population deprived of regular dental care, the experienced progression of disease between baseline (1987) and follow-up (1994) was investigated in relation to the composition of the subgingival microbiota at  follow-up. at baseline the age ranged from 15 to 25 years. clinical and microbiological evaluation was completed in 158 of the 167 subjects available at  follow-up. methods: plaque index (pi), pocket depth (pd), bleeding on probing (bop), and attachment loss (al) were scored at the approximal surfaces of all teeth and subgingival calculus on the approximal surfaces of the ramfjord teeth only (number of sites with subgingival calculus: nsc). a pooled sample of the deepest pocket in each quadrant was evaluated using microbiological culture techniques. results: at baseline the mean values of the clinical parameters were  al=0.35 mm, pi=1.01, bop=0.80 pd=3.25 mm and nsc=6.04 and at follow-up al=0.75 mm, pi=1.16, bop=1.19, pd=3.34 mm and nsc=5.85. all parameters except pd and nsc  showed a statistically significant increase. at follow-up the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 40%, of porphyromonas gingivalis 67%, of prevotella intermedia 66%, of fusobacterium nucleatum 79%, of bacteroides forsythus 16%, of campylobacter rectus 4%, and of p. micros 6%. no differences in clinical parameters were found between groups with or without these micro-organisms. in 129 subjects al of > or =2 mm at > or =1 site was found. logistic regression showed three significant odds-ratio's for experienced progressive periodontitis: plaque index (12.2), gender (3.4) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2.9). conclusions: the results of this retrospective study suggest that plaque is the most important parameter related to experienced disease progression, and that the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans may be associated with increased chance of disease progression.

TI  == smoking affects the subgingival microflora in periodontitis.
AB  == background: tobacco smoking has been identified as one major risk factor for destructive periodontal disease. scaling and root planing have been shown to be less effective in smokers with periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare the subgingival microbial flora of treated and untreated smokers and non-smokers. methods: four independent adult patient groups with periodontitis were included in this investigation: 88 untreated smokers (u-s); 90 untreated non-smokers (u-ns); 119 treated non-smokers (t-ns); and 171 treated smokers (t-s). clinical variables included cumulative plaque index (cpi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), cumulative bleeding index (cbi), and cumulative suppuration index (csi). paper point samples from the deepest bleeding pocket in each quadrant of the dentition were analyzed for the presence and levels of 6 periodontal bacterial pathogens using anaerobic culture techniques. results: u-s showed a higher mean cumulative plaque index than u-ns (3.5 versus 2.7). mean pd and mean cal were higher in the t-s in comparison to the t-ns group (7.0 versus 6.6 mm and 5.6 versus 4.7 mm, respectively). microbiological characteristics of u-s were a higher prevalence of prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and higher mean levels of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). t-s patients were characterized by higher prevalence of bacteroides forsythus (bf), pm, and campylobacter rectus (cr) and higher mean levels of pm and fn. the mean percentage of b. forsythus tended to be higher in the t-s group than in the t-ns group (6.9% versus 5.6%). the relative risk to be infected with bf, pm, and cr was statistically higher in smokers (odds ratios: 1.9, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively). the chance to find > or =10% of bf, pm, and/or fn was 3.3 higher in smokers when a. actinomycetemcomitans and p gingivalis were absent. detection of > or =20% pm/fn in treated patients was strongly associated with smoking (odds ratio 13.8, p= 0.002). conclusions: smoking is a determining factor for the composition of the subgingival microflora in adult patients with periodontitis and may select for a specific cluster of periodontal pathogens, notably bf, pm, fn, and cr. on the basis of these observations, smoking, among other criteria, may be one parameter to use in deciding to treat refractory periodontitis in smokers with a systemic antibiotic  therapy directed against smoking-associated periodontal bacteria.

TI  == expression of cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase in inflamed gingival  tissue.
AB  == background: periodontopathic bacteria induce inflammation of periodontal tissues. the cytokines and nitric oxide released in periodontal lesions have been reported to play a protective role in bacterial infection and to relate to the process of  inflammation. to clarify the relationship between colonization of periodontopathic bacteria and cytokines, we evaluated profiles of inflammatory cytokines, chemokine, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) and colonization by porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, which are major pathogens of periodontitis. methods: mrna  expression of cytokines and inos in inflamed and healthy gingival tissue was determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), and the relationship between their profiles and the detection of specific bacteria was analyzed. results: the relative expression of interleukin (il)-6 and inos mrnas in periodontal lesions was significantly higher than those in healthy individuals. il-6 mrna expression was also significantly higher at bleeding on probing (bop)-positive sites than at bop-negative sites. the expressions of il-1alpha and il-8 increased, but il-10 expression decreased at sites where a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected. we found no correlation between the expression of cytokine and inos mrna and infection by p. gingivalis. conclusions: the expression of il-6 may reflect inflammation in gingival tissue, and inos may  be involved in the inflammatory process in periodontitis. the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis might relate to the different cytokine profiles of il-1alpha, il-8, and il-10.

TI  == retrospective assessment of clinical and microbiological factors affecting periimplant tissue conditions.
AB  == an increasing number of studies point to the detrimental effect of plaque bacteria on periimplant tissue health. the purpose of this retrospective study was to explore a possible relationship between the clinical and microbiological periimplant conditions of osseointegrated oral implants after several years of service and the dental and medical history, as well as the conditions of the residual dentition. 45 partially edentulous patients (mean age: 51 years, range:  27-83 years), with a total of 64 implants participated in this retrospective analysis. the time between examination and the last dental visit ranged from 6 to 24 months (mean: 13 months) and the time since the last maintenance therapy appointment with a dental hygienist ranged between 3 and 24 months (mean 7 months). during 5 to 10 years between implant installation and examination, 9 implants experienced one episode and an additional 6 implants two episodes of periimplantitis. as a consequence of extensive bone loss associated with these infections, one of these implants, in a patient who had a history of diabetes, was lost. with this exception, the other episodes of periimplantitis were successfully treated employing the principles of the cumulative interceptive supportive therapy (cist) protocol. at examination, 42 implants (66%) showed a probing pocket depth exceeding 4 mm. of the periimplantitis sites, four implants  showed cultural evidence for presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, and 2 implants were positive for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. statistical analysis revealed a significant relationship between periimplant probing depth and the total anaerobic cultivable microbiota as well as the frequency of detection of p. gingivalis.

TI  == the influence of intracrevicular crown margins on gingival health: preliminary findings.
AB  == statement of problem: the effect on gingival tissue of various crown materials in combination with different abutment biomaterials should be investigated. purpose: this in vivo study determined the gingival health and subgingival levels of periodontal inflammation-associated bacteria adjacent to various crown and abutment material combinations. material and methods: . patients in the study received 1 of 5 treatments: an all-ceramic crown luted to a natural tooth, a metal-ceramic (titanium) crown luted to natural tooth, a metal-ceramic (high noble alloy) crown luted to natural tooth, an all-ceramic crown luted to a titanium implant abutment, or a metal-ceramic (high noble alloy) crown luted to a titanium implant abutment. plaque was collected at least 6 months after luting by paper point from the gingival sulcus of each crown and an adjacent unrestored (control) tooth. dna probe analysis was performed to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in addition, plaque, gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding scores were recorded with use of the california dental association scale. statistical analysis was used to determine the effect of restoration/abutment type on levels of the bacterial species and clinical parameters pertaining to gingival health. results: none of the sulci sampled contained detectable levels of the 3 bacteria. plaque levels and gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding scores were low. all treatment groups had similar soft tissue response as measured by gingival redness, swelling, and bleeding. plaque scores from all-ceramic crown/implant abutment sites were higher than plaque scores from all-ceramic crown/natural tooth sites. however, differences between experimental and control sites within the same treatment group were not observed (p>.05) with any of the 4 clinical measures. conclusion: in patients with suitable oral hygiene, tooth-supported and implant-supported crowns with intracrevicular margins were not predisposed to unfavorable gingival and microbial responses.

TI  == environmental cues and gene expression in porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == microorganisms typically adapt to environmental cues by turning on and off the expression of virulence genes which, in turn, allows for optimal growth and survival within different environmental niches. this adaptation strategy includes sensing and responding to changes in nutrients, ph, temperature, oxygen tension,  redox potential, microbial flora, and osmolarity. for a bacterium to adhere to, penetrate, replicate in, and colonize host cells, it is critical that virulence genes are expressed during certain periods of the infection process. thus, throughout the different stages of an infection, different sets of virulence factors are turned on and off in response to different environmental signals, allowing the bacterium to effectively adapt to its varying niche. in this review, we focus on the regulation of virulence gene expression in two pathogens which have been implicated as major etiological agents in adult and juvenile periodontal diseases: porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. understanding the mechanisms of virulence gene expression  in response to the local environment of the host will provide crucial information in the development of effective treatments targeted at eradication of these periodontal disease pathogens.

TI  == treatment outcome for iddm patients in relation to glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies and serum igg to periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) have elevated risk for periodontitis (pd) relative to subjects without diabetes. whether refractory pd in iddm patients is related to autoimmunity as indicated by serum glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody gad ab levels or to host bacterial immunity as reflected by serum antibody titers to periodontal pathogens is unknown. aims: to determine if non-surgical periodontal treatment outcome differs between gad ab-seropositive and -seronegative iddm patients by assessing the following parameters: (1) pretreatment serum levels of gad ab, (2) pretreatment serum igg titers to key periodontal pathogens, and (3) changes in periodontal pocket probing depth (pdc) after treatment. methods: before and two months after  periodontal treatment of 11 gad ab-seronegative and 7 -seropositive subjects, pdc was assessed and serum gad ab and igg to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), bacteroides forsythus (bj), and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were studied using established radioligand precipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. results: the pdc decrease was significantly better for gad ab-seronegative subjects than for seropositive subjects (median 1.4 mm+/-0.5 s.d. versus 0.5 mm+/-0.3 s.d., p<0.03, mann-whitney). gad ab levels  and pdc were positively correlated (r=+0.71, p<0.05) for sero-positive subjects but were neutral (r=-0.07) for seronegative subjects. serum igg to pg and gad ab  levels were positively associated (r2=0.42) in seropositive subjects. logistic regression analysis confirmed that gad ab status was the primary discriminator for pdc (p<0.04). conclusion: detection of elevated gad ab levels in combination  with elevated igg titers to pg before treatment is indicative of iddm patients with refractory pd.

TI  == effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on clinical parameters and the numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at adult periodontitis sites.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of this study was to relate the numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells to clinical parameters at diseased and healthy periodontal sites before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy using a sensitive quantitative pcr method (q-pcr). method: the sensitivity of the q-pcr was less than 10 cells for all three species. subgingival plaque samples were collected from 541 sites in 50 adult periodontitis subjects pre-treatment, post-treatment and at a follow-up visit (3-6 months post-treatment). pocket probing depth, attachment loss and bleeding on probing were recorded at each visit and both healthy and diseased sites in each subject were sampled. results:  quantification revealed that p. gingivalis counts were associated with pocket depth (p=0.006) and attachment loss (p=0.010); however, neither p. intermedia nor a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with the clinical signs examined. post-treatment, there was a significant decrease in the numbers of all three species in both the diseased and healthy sites (86-99%) but none were eradicated. positive associations were found between any two of the three species studied both pre- and post-therapy. by the follow-up visit, there was a significant improvement in the probing depth of deep sites (p=0.001) but in no other clinical parameters. conclusion: this study demonstrates the usefulness of q-pcr for enumerating putative pathogens in clinical periodontal specimens and that the numbers of the three organisms in all sites decrease with non-surgical periodontal therapy.

TI  == the effect of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of patients with recurrent periodontitis.
AB  == background: subjects with periodontal disease exist who either (i) respond poorly to initial mechanical therapy ("refractory" periodontitis) or (ii) fail to adopt  adequate self-performed plaque control techniques and hence develop recurrent disease ("recurrent" periodontitis) at multiple sites during the supportive treatment phase (spt). various systemic antibiotic regimens have been tried as adjuncts to the mechanical (re-) treatment of such "difficult to treat"-patients. while most studies indicated a positive outcome of the adjunctive therapy, some clinical investigators reported that this additional measure provided little or no benefit. aim: the aim of the present investigation was to study the more long  term effect of adjunctive antibiotic therapy in the re-treatment of patients with a well defined history of recurrent periodontitis. material and methods: 17 subjects with recurrent advanced periodontal disease were, following a baseline examination, subjected to non-surgical therapy including the use of systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin and metronidazole). they were placed in a careful spt program and re-examined after 1, 3 and 5 years. the examinations included both clinical and microbiological assessments. results: it was demonstrated that in subjects with advanced and recurrent periodontitis, re-treatment including (i) comprehensive scaling and root planing (srp), (ii) systemic administration of antibiotics and (iii) meticulous supragingival plaque control by both mechanical  and chemical means established periodontal conditions that in the short term (3 years) and in the majority of subjects could be properly maintained by traditional spt measures. between 3 and 5 years, however, only 5 of the 17 subjects exhibited stable periodontal attachment levels. conclusions: some deep pockets and furcations were most likely inadequately instrumented during the active treatment phase. microorganisms residing in biofilms left in such locations were probably not sufficiently affected by the 2 weeks of adjunctive antibiotic therapy. it is suggested that removal of certain subgingival deposits, therefore, may require surgical intervention.

TI  == immunodominant antigens in periodontal disease: a real or illusive concept?
AB  == the humoral arm of the immune system provides protection from many medically significant pathogens. the antigenic epitopes of the pathogens which induce these responses, and the subsequent characteristics of the host response, have been extensively documented in the medical literature, and in many cases have resulted in the development and implementation of effective vaccines or diagnostic tests.  there is a substantial body of literature on the humoral immune response in periodontal disease, which is targeted at micro-organisms present within periodontal pockets. however, the significance and specificity of the immune response in periodontal disease have proved difficult to elucidate, due to the large number of potential pathogens in the plaque biofilm and the apparent commensal nature of many of these opportunistic pathogens. this review addresses  our current knowledge of the approaches and strategies which have been used to elucidate and examine the concept of immunodominant antigens in medical infections and, more recently, periodontal disease. an identification/understanding of the immunodominant antigens would be informative  with respect to: (i) the relative importance of the implicated pathogens, (ii) new approaches to immunological diagnosis, (iii) specific bacterial virulence determinants, (iv) natural protective responses, and (v) the selection of potential vaccine candidate antigens. we conclude that immunodominance of antigens in periodontal disease may be relevant to our understanding of periodontal disease pathogenesis, but due to the complexity and diversity of the  'pathogenic microbial ecology', it is currently an enigmatic topic requiring a multidisciplinary approach linking clinical, microbiological, and immunological investigations. we also conclude, after assessing the literature available on the topic of immunodominance, that it is a term that, if used, must be clearly defined and understood, since it is often used loosely, leading to a general misinterpretation by readers of oral and medical literature.

TI  == molecular strategies for fimbrial expression and assembly.
AB  == fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. type i fimbriae and p pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type ii secretion system. curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. oral pathogens,  such as eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. these fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens have type 4-like  fimbriae, whereas p. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. to date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. the putative major fimbrial subunits, fima and fimp of a. naeslundii and fap1 of s. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. the presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both s. parasanguis and a. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. the model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.

AB  == background: the pathogenesis of early-onset periodontitis (eop) can be explained  by various host risk factors. previous studies have focused on a single (among many possible) immunological risk factor and the association among the factors has not been assessed. we comprehensively investigated the associations among multiple host immunological risk factors in eop patients to further elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of eop. methods: sixty-eight eop patients (50 generalized eop, 18 localized eop), 51 eop-suspected patients (s-eop), 43 adult periodontitis (ap) patients, and 36 periodontally healthy subjects (hs) participated in this cross-sectional study. we examined peripheral neutrophil functions, phenotypic and functional characterization of peripheral lymphocytes (lymphocyte subsets, t-cell proliferative activity), cytokine productivity (interleukin [il]-1, il-2, tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-alpha, interferon [ifn]-gamma, il-4 and il-6), serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody titers against 12 periodontal bacteria, and hla class ii genotypes. results: g-eop, s-eop, and ap patient groups showed significantly lower percentages of pan t cells and cd8-positive cells (p < 0.02) compared with the hs group. l-eop patients showed depressed il-4 and tnf-alpha productivity compared with the hs group (p < 0.02).  the eop group showed significantly elevated antibody levels against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and fusobacterium nucleatum compared with the hs group (p < 0.05). the frequency with dqb1*0503 was significantly higher in the eop patient group than the hs group (p = 0.045) due to the higher frequency in l-eop patients than the hs group (p = 0.035). there were wide interindividual variations in each of the tests among patient and hs groups; however, eop patients showed wider intradiagnostic group variations in certain host defensive cell functions than the other groups. there were some eop patients who showed extremely low or high values in some tests; the eop patients could be further divided into subgroups according to their host defensive and immunological profiles. however, there was  heterogeneity in some of the other host immunological tests even in the subgroups. conclusions: the association of host immunological risk factors in eop patients is widely varied and more complex than previously thought. these results indicate the difficulty of explaining the pathogenesis of eop based on a single host risk factor and also emphasize the importance of critical assessment of not  only eop patient groups, but also individual patients.

TI  == move of adults with mental retardation from institutions to community-based living: changes in the oral microbiological flora.
AB  == in the western world, the policy of deinstitutionalization and integration of individuals with mental retardation is generally accepted. we tested the hypothesis that de-institutionalization may lead to changes of habits with a potential to influence oral health. when 57 adults with mental retardation moved  from an institution to community-based living, their oral hygiene habits, gingival bleeding, and a three-day food record were registered one month before and 9 and 21 months after the move. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans  in supragingival plaque, and c. albicans on mucous membranes were analyzed. after 21 months of community-based living, fewer persons showed high classes of mutans  streptococci, growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, and high frequency of sucrose intake, and more subjects showed growth of c. albicans. in a short perspective, the indicators of oral diseases suggest an unchanged or lower risk of oral diseases after the de-institutionalization of individuals with moderate or severe mental retardation.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == a 2-step non-surgical procedure and systemic antibiotics in the treatment of rapidly progressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: in the last few years knowledge about periodontal infections has increased enormously, nevertheless practitioners are still seeking guidelines for suitable treatment concepts. methods: the aim of this study was to examine the effect of doxycycline, metronidazole, and clindamycin used adjunctively in a 2-step nonsurgical procedure in patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp). the first step included scaling, root planing, and polishing (srp) in each quadrant using 4 to 5 visits. the second step included full-mouth enhanced root planing (rp) and wound dressing in 1 or 2 visits after srp and the beginning of antibiotic therapy. forty-eight patients (mean age 32.4 years) with generalized rpp, with an average of 16 sites with probing depths (pd) deeper than 8 mm, and high counts of porphyromonas gingivalis were randomly assigned to 4 different groups: group 1 (doxycycline) n = 12, group 2 (metronidazole) n = 15, group 3 (clindamycin) n = 11, and group 4 (control group; no antibiotic treatment) n = 10. clinical evaluations, including plaque index (pi), sulcus bleeding index (sbi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bacteriological and crevicular cell sampling, were done at baseline (bl), 3 weeks after srp, and  6 and 24 months after rp. results: after the first step (srp), we observed an improvement of pi and sbi in all 4 groups, but did not see any statistically significant pd reduction 3 weeks after srp compared to baseline. however, 6 and 24 months after the second step (rp) we observed a significantly greater reduction of pd in groups 2 and 3 and a significantly greater cal gain in comparison to groups 1 and 4. after 24 months, the attachment level gain in group 1 and group 4 was less than 1.5 mm, and less than 1.0 mm in pd site categories 6  to 9 mm and >9 mm. pi showed no significant difference between the groups throughout the period after srp until 24 months, compared to 3 weeks after srp. sbi decreased most in the metronidazole and clindamycin groups. p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were almost completely eradicated in these 2 groups 24 months after rp. in addition, the phagocytotic capacity of crevicular polymorphonuclear neutrophils was increased in groups 2 and 3 after the second step. conclusions: the present results show that metronidazole and clindamycin are effective antibiotics when used adjunctively in a 2-step nonsurgical procedure of scaling and root planing in rpp patients.

TI  == downregulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression via ep2/ep4 receptors by prostaglandin e2 in human fibroblasts.
AB  == in the present study, the effect of prostaglandin e2 (pge2) on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) expression in human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) was investigated. lps were isolated from periodontopathic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), by the phenol-water method and escherichia coli (e. coli) lps was used as a control. pge2 significantly inhibited a. actinomycetemcomitans-, p. gingivalis- and e. coli-lps-induced icam-1 expression. next, of four pge2 receptor subtypes (ep1, ep2, ep3 and ep4), we examined which subtype(s) was involved in inhibition of lps-elicited icam-1 expression by pge2. eleven-deoxy-pge1, a selective ep2/ep4 agonist, and butaprost, a selective ep2 agonist, attenuated a. actinomycetemcomitans-, p. gingivalis- and e. coli-lps-elicited icam-1 expression, although butaprost was less potent than pge2 and 11-deoxy-pge1. sulprostone, an ep1/ep3 agonist, and ono-ap-324, an ep3 agonist, was inert to the lps-elicited icam-1 expression. furthermore, dibutyryl camp, a camp analogue, and forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, downregulated a. actinomycetemcomitans-, p. gingivalis- and e. coli-lps-elicited icam-1 expression in hgf. our data suggest that pge2 downregulates a. actinomycetemcomitans- and p. gingivalis-lps-induced icam-1 expression in hgf, via ep2/ep4 receptors by camp-dependent signaling pathways. the camp-elevating agents such as ep2/ep4 receptor activators may serve to control inflammatory and immune responses in periodontal disease.

TI  == comparison of microbial composition in the subgingival plaque of adult crowded versus non-crowded dental regions.
AB  == it has been reported in the literature that certain species of bacteria (periodontopathogens) present in the subgingival plaque are associated with destructive periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the presence and proportional distribution of periodontopathogens in the  subgingival plaque of adult crowded versus non-crowded dental regions. thirty adult patients with anterior dental crowding were selected from the orthodontic clinic of the university of pennsylvania. after orthodontic records were taken and the periodontal examination was performed, subgingival plaque samples were collected from crowded (experimental) and contralateral non-crowded regions (control) of each patient. the presence of 9 periodontopathic species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium species, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus, was determined using culture and immunofluorescence techniques. the bacterial morphotype was also determined by the use of dark-field microscopy. it was found  that supragingival plaque accumulation in crowded regions was significantly greater than in non-crowded regions. analysis of the bacteria showed that the samples from crowded regions consistently contained more species of periodontopathogens than the samples from non-crowded regions. morphologically, more spirochetes and motile rods were present in the crowded-region samples. in terms of the presence of individual periodontopathogens, fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, c rectus, and p micros were significantly more common in  the crowded samples than in the non-crowded samples. it was concluded that: (1) more plaque accumulated in crowded areas; (2) more species of periodontopathogens were present in the subgingival plaque of crowded regions; (3) morphologically, more spirochetes and motile rods were present in crowded areas; and (4) fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, c rectus, and p micros were present more often in crowded areas than in non-crowded areas (p < 0.05).

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == role of bacterial proteinases in matrix destruction and modulation of host responses.
AB  == recently accumulated large bodies of evidence have strongly implicated proteolytic enzymes released by subgingival plaque bacteria in the pathogenicity  of periodontal disease. with regard to proteolytic power, however, the contribution from different microbial species considered as periodontal pathogens is not equal. two of these bacteria, p. gingivalis and t. denticola, have developed an elaborate proteolytic systems composed of several surface-located or secreted enzymes, which apparently serve a role to provide bacteria with nutrients in the form of small peptides and amino acids. of these two species, proteinases of p. gingivalis are the most intensively studied, and during the last decade an impressive array of information has been accumulated with respect  to the biochemical characterization of purified proteinases and structure of the  genes encoding them, the regulation of expression and the effects of these enzymes on host systems. in addition, studies on proteinase-deficient isogenic mutants has shed light on both their housekeeping functions and potential role(s) in the pathogenicity of periodontitis. among several proteinases produced by p. gingivalis, the cysteine proteinases, referred to as gingipains, are clearly in the spotlight. they are the subject of several recent reviews and generally considered as the major virulence factors of this periodontal pathogen (59, 105,  139, 182, 183, 186, 281, 284, 286, 289). gingipains seem to be key players in subverting host defense systems with, significantly, the complement and neutrophils being the main target. in addition, through uncontrolled activation of kallikrein/kinin pathway and coagulation cascade they contribute to local generation of bradykinin and thrombin, two synergistically working pro-inflammatory reagents with a strongly, although indirectly, stimulatory effect on bone resorption. furthermore, the ability to interact with the cytokine networking systems has the potential to dysregulate the local inflammatory reaction. finally, gingipains have a strong effect on mechanisms controlling host matrix metalloproteinase activity at the level of gene expression and zymogen activation (fig. 10). collectively, at the periodontal lesion site, the non-restrained action of gingipains, supported by other proteinases locally produced by subgingival plaque bacteria, would dysregulate most mechanisms controlling inflammatory reaction. although successful in limiting infection to the periodontium, the ultimate effect of uncontrolled inflammatory processes would be the destruction of periodontal connective tissue, certainly the hallmark of periodontitis.

AB  == reactive oxygen species have been implicated as important pathological mediators  in many clinical disorders, including periodontal disease. as a possible alternative for the treatment of periodontal disease, the antimicrobial activity  of six tannins isolated from vaccinium vitis-idaea l., with confirmed antioxidant activity, were assayed by the agar dilution method against selected periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the results showed that epicatechin-(4beta-->8)-epicatechin-(4beta-->8, 2beta-->o-->7)-catechin had strong antimicrobial activity against p. gingivalis and p. intermedia, but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. the other tannins tested did not show antimicrobial activity. we conclude that tannins isolated from v. vitis-idaea l. with antimicrobial activity could potentially be used for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == [bacterial virulence in the etiology of periodontal diseases].
AB  == strong relationships have been very often described between various form of periodontal disease (pd) and certain bacterial species, so that nowadays periodontal disease is recognized as an infectious disease. destruction of periodontal supporting tissues happens as a response to very intricate host-parasite interactions. when the clinician will be able to fully understand and identify such phenomena it would be possible to succeed in a properly diagnosis and control of the active phase of periodontal disease. the first step  in such a direction would be to analyze the common characteristic of some bacterial species, the so called suspected periodontopathogens. such species namely gram-negative, associated with the outbreak of periodontal disease have in common the capacity to disrupt the integrity of the host defences by means of the so called virulence factors. these factors may enhance the bacterial colonization or may interfere with the host response that ultimately results in periodontal support breakdown. the present review focuses on the virulence factors of the main suspected periodontopathogens evaluating the effects on the host immune response and directly on the periodontal tissues.

TI  == lethal photosensitization for decontamination of implant surfaces in the treatment of peri-implantitis.
AB  == peri-implantitis is considered to be a multifactorial process involving bacterial contamination of the implant surface. a previous study demonstrated that a combination of toluidine blue o (100 microgram/ml) and irradiation with a diode soft laser with a wavelength of 905 nm results in an elimination of porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia), and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) on different implant surfaces (machined, plasma-flame-sprayed, etched, hydroxyapatite-coated). the aim of this study was to examine the laser effect in vivo. in 15 patients with imz implants who showed clinical and radiographic signs of peri-implantitis, toluidine blue o was applied to the implant surface for 1 min and the surface was then irradiated with a diode soft laser with a wavelength of 690 nm for 60 s. bacterial samples were taken before and after application of the dye and after lasing. the cultures were evaluated semiquantitatively for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia. it was found that the combined treatment reduced the bacterial counts by 2 log steps on average. the application of tbo and laser resulted in a significant reduction (p<0.0001) of the initial values in all 3 groups of bacteria. complete elimination of bacteria  was not achieved.

AB  == both tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (pai-2) are important proteolysis factors present in inflamed human periodontal tissues. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (lps) on the synthesis of t-pa and pai-2 by human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). lps from different periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum were extracted by the hot phenol water method. the levels of t-pa and pai-2 secreted into the cell culture media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). the mrna for t-pa and pai-2 were measured by rt-pcr. the results showed t-pa synthesis was increased in response to all types  of lps studied and pai-2 level was increased by lps from a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, but not p. gingivalis. when comparing the effects of lps from non-periodontal bacteria (escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis) with the lps from periodontal pathogens, we found that the ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was greater following exposure of the cells to lps from periodontal pathogens. the highest ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was found in those cells exposed to lps from p. gingivalis. these results indicate that lps derived from periodontal pathogens may cause unbalanced regulation of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor by hgf and such an effect may, in part, contribute to the destruction of periodontal connective tissue through dysregulated pericellular proteolysis.

AB  == background: the diagnosis and treatment of early-onset forms of periodontitis (eop) represent a major challenge to periodontists. in this case report, we describe a multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of a patient with severe  generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp). our approach incorporates clinical laboratory evaluation with conventional concepts of periodontal pathogenesis and  therapeutics to diagnose and effectively treat eop. methods: the 17-year-old female patient presented with clinical and radiographic evidence of severe attachment loss. microbiological testing showed the presence of known periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia,  and porphyromonas gingivalis. routine immunological tests did not reveal any of the functional defects thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of eop after initiation of therapy, which consisted of scaling and root planing, supplemented  with administration of systemic antibiotics, a reduction in probing depth and gain in clinical attachment could be demonstrated. microbiological testing was used to monitor the composition of the periodontal microbiota and to adjust antimicrobial therapy accordingly. results: using a non-surgical approach to treatment, except for 2 root amputations performed without flap reflection, we have been able to stabilize this patient's periodontal condition over the course  of a 2-year follow-up period. conclusions: this treatment strategy provides an efficacious alternative to more aggressive forms of therapy and should therefore  be considered for the treatment of patients with severe eop.

AB  == background: previous longitudinal studies investigating the role of microorganisms in periodontitis have focused on subjects with a high prevalence and severity of disease. the complex profile of microbial species in severe cases of periodontitis might not allow us to differentiate which bacterial species initiate disease or which species simply proliferate after disease progression. this prospective longitudinal study followed a group of 205 subjects who showed a low prevalence and severity of adult periodontitis, and thus allowed us to monitor early microbiological changes in the development of periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque was collected from proximal surfaces of a posterior sextant at 6-month intervals for 2 years. during the monitoring period, 44 subjects had either attachment loss or attachment gain. using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr), all plaque samples from those 44 subjects were analyzed for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: both subjects with attachment loss and those with attachment gain had a high prevalence of these 3 periodontal  pathogens. the mere presence of any of the 3 species at a site could not predict  future attachment loss at that specific site. however, subjects with a persistent presence of b. forsythus at any site across all visits had 5.3 times higher odds  of having at least one site in their mouth losing attachment compared to subjects with occasional or no presence of b. forsythus. conclusions: the persistence of b. forsythus identified subjects at higher risk, but not which specific sites in  those subjects would lose attachment.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic study of periodontal surgery by means of apically positioned flaps with and without osseous recontouring.
AB  == in periodontitis lesions with interproximal craters, periodontal flap surgery with osseous recontouring allows more apical positioning of the soft periodontal  tissue than flap surgery without osseous recontouring. the present study determined the clinical and microbiologic responses to periodontal surgery with and without osseous recontouring in adult periodontitis lesions with interproximal craters. in 7 osseous surgery patients, osteoplasty and ostectomy were performed from the lingual/palatal aspect to eliminate interproximal osseous defects and to partly mimic the original alveolar bony transition to neighboring  teeth. in 7 nonosseous surgery patients, the surgical flap was adapted to the preexisting osseous level. clinical monitoring included periodontal probing depth, plaque index, gingival bleeding index, and radiographic examination. samples of the subgingival microbiota were examined. in sites treated with osseous surgery, mean pocket depth was 5.5 mm at baseline, 1.9 mm at 1 month, 2.0 mm at 3 months, and 2.1 mm at 6 months. in sites not receiving osseous recontouring surgery, the corresponding pocket depths were 5.9 mm, 3.1 mm, 3.8 mm, and 4.1 mm. at baseline in the osseous surgery group, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was recovered from one patient and porphyromonas gingivalis from 5 patients; posttreatment, these microbiota were not detected in any patient. in the nonosseous surgery group, the presence of a actinomycetemcomitans increased posttreatment, and levels of p gingivalis remained essentially unchanged after therapy. this study suggests that in patients not receiving adjunctive antibiotic therapy, apically positioned flap surgery with osseous recontouring is more effective than apically positioned flap surgery without osseous recontouring in reducing periodontal pocket depth and levels of major periodontal pathogens.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == some local and systemic immunological features of prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present investigation was to study local (gingival) and systemic host defense characteristics in a sample of children exhibiting local prepubertal periodontitis (lpp). material and methods: 2 groups of subjects were included in the present study. one group consisted of 11 children (9.5+/-2.0 years) with signs of periodontal disease (lpp group). a 2nd group comprised 21 adults (48.1+/-5.8 years) with advanced periodontal disease: adult periodontitis  (ap) group. gingival biopsies and a sample of peripheral blood were obtained in each individual of the ap group and in 7 out of the 11 subjects in the lpp group. the biopsies were prepared for morphometrical and immunohistochemical analysis and the blood samples prepared for immunohistochemical analysis. results: the cellular infiltrates in the biopsies of the lpp group contained a larger proportion of lymphocytes and, in particular b cells, than was the case in the ap group. the tcr valpha/vbeta gene expression in the lesions in the ap group was dominated by vbeta 17 and in the lpp group by valpha2. the content in peripheral  blood of various lymphocyte sub-populations and tcr valpha/vbeta gene expression  in the 2 groups was almost similar. conclusion: it is suggested that (i) the systemic host response in children with prepubertal periodontitis has many features in common with that seen in adult patients but that (ii) local defense mechanisms in the periodontitis lesion of lpp differ from those in adult periodontitis.

TI  == diagnostic characteristics of clinical and microbiological tests for monitoring periodontal and peri-implant mucosal tissue conditions during supportive periodontal therapy (spt).
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate a clinical and a microbiological test for monitoring tissue condition during supportive periodontal therapy (spt) and to compare their diagnostic characteristics at implant and tooth sites. twelve female (age: 37-72 years) and 7 male patients (age: 26-83 years) were evaluated in this study on the basis of availability to follow a rigid spt program. patients had received a complete periodontal examination at 1 and 5 years after implant placement. this included standardized radiographs obtained at implants and matching control teeth. one implant site and one tooth site per patient were  followed during the last 2 years of the spt program. at each recall visit microbiological samples were analyzed according to dna/rna analysis identifying periodontal pathogens (iai pado test 4.5, institute for applied immunology, zuchwil, switzerland). presence or absence of bleeding on probing at these sites  was also noted using a standardized probing force of 0.25 n (audio probe, esro, thalwil zh, switzerland). the percentage number of recall visits with positive bacteriological test results and positive bop scores were calculated. disease progression at the sites was defined if the annual increase in probing depth was  > or = 0.5 mm/year (2.5 mm in 5 years) or if the annual decrease in cadia values  (computer assisted densitometric image analysis) was more than -0.7 per year (-3.5 in 5 years). changes below these values were considered as negative test results indicating stability of the sites. the diagnostic characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) of bop and microbiological tests alone or in combination were then calculated using two-by-two tables. by application of increasing thresholds of bop frequencies set for definition of positive test outcome (bop > or = 10% > or = 20% > or = 25% > or = 50% > or = 75% > or = 90% or the combined bop > or = 75%, but dna positive > or = 10%, > or = 25% > or = 34% > or = 50% > or = 67% > or = 90%) receiver operator characteristics curves (roc) were constructed for teeth and implants. the areas under the roc curves were calculated and compared by means of chi-square tests. the results indicated statistically significant better diagnostic characteristics of both tests at implants compared to teeth. the inclusion of an additional microbiological test significantly enhanced the diagnostic characteristics of bop alone at teeth as well as at implants.

TI  == early colonization of dental implants by putative periodontal pathogens in partially edentulous patients.
AB  == there is limited scientific information available on the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets in partially edentulous individuals. knowledge about this process is one step in better understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. in this study, the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets by putative periodontal pathogens was studied in 20 partially edentulous  individuals using anaerobic culture techniques. at baseline, the presence and levels of putative periodontal pathogens in the microflora of periodontal pockets and saliva were established. immediately after loading of the titanium implants and after 6 and 12 months the presence and levels of selected putative periodontal pathogens were determined in periodontal and peri-implant pockets. a  second aim was to detect bacterial contamination of the implant site and the inside of the implant. at baseline, the most frequently isolated species from the periodontal pockets were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros. bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were isolated from 9, 2 and 3  patients respectively. six months after placing of the bridges, the majority of the implant sites had detectable levels of most periodontal bacterial species with the exception of a. actinomycetemcomitans which could not be isolated from any of the peri-implant samples during the experimental period, although 2 patients had this organism at baseline. in 2 patients with detectable subgingival p. gingivalis at baseline this species was found after 12 months in the peri-implant sites. one of these patients lost 2 implants which was associated with a high proportion of p. gingivalis in the peri-implant pockets. a second patient developed 2 fistulas around 2 implants at 8 months and this event was also associated with the presence of p. gingivalis. it is concluded that proper periodontal infection control before installment of dental implants in partially  edentulous patients may prevent early bacterial complications.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

TI  == inhibition of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxicity by bacteria from the subgingival flora.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces a pore-forming leukotoxin that lyses human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes. certain proteolytic bacteria may coexist with a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets. we aimed therefore to examine whether oral bacteria can modify the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans. a total of 55 strains representing 45 bacterial species of the subgingival flora were tested. each strain was incubated with the highly toxic strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans hk 1519 and the leukotoxic activity of the suspension against human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was determined from the activity of the lactate dehydrogenase released upon lysis of the leukocytes. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella loeschii inhibited the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans cells as well as the activity of leukotoxin purified from the same strain. the bacterial strains without the ability to block leukotoxic activity also failed to destroy pure leukotoxin even after 5 h of incubation. the proteolytic degradation of leukotoxin by p. gingivalis was mainly dependent on the activity of the enzymes r- and k-gingipains. p. intermedia and p. nigrescens also degraded the leukotoxin by enzymes. the results imply a role of the periodontal microflora in modifying the virulence of a. actinomycetemcomitans by destroying its leukotoxin.

TI  == individual diversities in interferon gamma production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == polarization of type 1 (th1) or type 2 (th2) immune responses determines the prognosis of many infectious diseases. interferon gamma (ifn-gamma) and il-4 are  key cytokines for the development of type 1 and type 2 immune responses, respectively. the aim of this study was to examine individual diversities in the  polarization of type 1 and type 2 responses against periodontopathic bacteria. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from adult periodontitis (ap) patients and healthy (h) subjects were stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus with or without polymyxin-b, ctla-4 ig and anti-il-12 antibody. ifn-gamma, il-4 and il-12 in the  culture supernatant were measured. ifn-gamma and il-4 producing cells were also examined using a multiparameter flow cytometric assay. bone resorption rate in ap patients was calculated using schei's method, and the probing pocket depth was also measured. pbmcs from ap patients and h subjects produced ifn-gamma and il-12, whereas the production of il-4 was rarely observed. among the bacteria tested, a. actinomycetemcomitans was the most potent inducer of ifn-gamma and il-12, and the reaction was inhibited by polymyxin-b. ifn-gamma was found to be produced by t cells in the pbmcs, and the production was significantly reduced by ctla-4 ig and anti-il-12 neutralizing antibody. the amount of ifn-gamma produced  by the pbmcs of ap patients and h subjects varied among individuals, and was significantly correlated with the amount of il-12 produced in a particular individual. the production of ifn-gamma was not related with periodontal condition which was evaluated using bone resorption and pocket depth. these results suggest that polarization of type 1 response against periodontopathic bacteria is dependent on the production of il-12 by monocytes, and that il-12 stimulates ifn-gamma production. however, individual diversities of ifn-gamma production might not be directly related to the severity of periodontitis.

TI  == untreated periodontal disease in indonesian adolescents. longitudinal clinical data and prospective clinical and microbiological risk assessment.
AB  == background, aims: in order to investigate the r le of various putative clinical and microbiological risk markers, a longitudinal study was initiated in a young population deprived of regular dental care. in 1987 all inhabitants in the age range 15-25 years living in a village with approximately 2,000 inhabitants at a tea estate on western java, indonesia, were examined clinically and microbiologically. in total, 167 subjects of the original group of 255 adolescents were re-examined in 1994. the material presented in this paper describes the clinical periodontal condition at baseline (1987) and at follow-up  (1994), 7 years later. furthermore, the relationship between progression of the disease and baseline clinical and microbiological data was assessed. methods: plaque index (pi), bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd), and attachment loss (al) were scored at the approximal surfaces of the vestibular aspects of all teeth. the number of approximal surfaces of the ramfjord teeth showing subgingival calculus was recorded. at baseline, the dorsum of the tongue, the buccal gingiva in the upper jaw, the saliva and the deepest bleeding pocket without clinical loss of attachment were sampled for microbiological examination  with phase contrast microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence. results: mean values at baseline and at follow-up were pi: 1.01 and 1.15, bop: 0.80 and 1.16, pd 3.26 mm and 3.32 mm, al: 0.33 mm and 0.73 mm, respectively. all parameters except pd showed a statistically significant increase over the 7-year period. the prevalence of the studied bacteria irrespective of the sample site was: a. actinomycetemcomitans 53%, p. gingivalis 88%, p. intermedia 100%, spirochetes 89% and motile micro-organisms 100%. at the full mouth level, logistic regression showed significant odds ratios for progressive disease with age (1.15), subgingival calculus (1.20) and subgingival presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans  (4.61). presence of any of the selected micro-organisms on the mucous membranes was not related with progressive disease. in order to study local factors to explain local disease activity, each subject was characterized using the sampled  pocket, which was the deepest bleeding pocket without la at baseline, as a single response site per patient. in this constrained design, the main statistical factors associated with progressive disease were presence of motile micro-organisms and the plaque score. conclusions: this study identified 3 main risk markers for disease progression at the full mouth level: age, amount of subgingival calculus and subgingival presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans.

AB  == background, aims: the purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of bacterial antigens for porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) in subgingival plaque of periodontitis patients after periodontal treatment was associated with progressive alveolar bone loss. method: 39 (39) subjects in good general health previously diagnosed with adult periodontitis within the last 2 years, and still  presenting with probing depth >5 mm in 2 to 6 teeth, were studied. all subjects were treated with scaling and root planing. half of the subjects were randomly assigned to receive adjunctive systemic doxycycline (200 mg the 1st day, then 100 mg per day for 21 days). subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline, 1, 3  and 6 months after therapy. a modified elisa test (evalusite, periodontal test kit, eastman kodak co., rochester, ny) was used to test for plaque antigens associated with p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans. progressive alveolar bone loss was determined using digital subtraction radiography with standardized radiographs taken at baseline and 6 months after treatment. results: the presence of p. gingivalis in plaque after treatment was significantly associated with progressive bone loss (positive predictive value 84%, negative predictive value 85%, odds ratio 31.9, p<0.0001). in contrast, the  presence of p. intermedia in plaque after treatment was not indicative of progressive loss (positive predictive value 39%, negative predictive value 82%).  too few sites had evidence of a. actinomycetemcomitans to be amenable to statistical analysis. no significant difference in bone loss was attributable to  the systemic antibiotic therapy. conclusion: these data indicated that, in this population, the presence of p. gingivalis in plaque after treatment might be indicative of progressive alveolar bone loss.

TI  == photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. pdt is a potential adjunct to scaling and root  planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. however, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. we have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. potent  antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of cfu per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. the use  of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == cyclooxygenase-2-dependent prostaglandin production by peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharides isolated from periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: prostaglandin e2 (pge2) plays important roles in the pathogenesis of  periodontal disease. recent studies have revealed the existence of 2 isozymes of  cyclooxygenase (cox), called cox-1 and cox-2. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the contribution of cox-1 and cox-2 to pge2 production by human peripheral blood monocytes that are stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathogenic bacteria. methods: lps were isolated from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) by the phenol-water method. peripheral blood monocytes were stimulated with lps for the indicated periods, and the levels of pge2 or interleukin (il)-1 beta in the culture media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. expression of cox-1 and -2 proteins was studied by immunocytochemical staining, and cox-2 mrna expression was examined by northern blot analysis. results: peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans- or p. gingivalis-lps produced pge2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. indomethacin, a non-selective cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor, and ns-398, a specific cox-2 inhibitor, completely inhibited pge2 production. immunocytochemical staining of cox-1 and cox-2 proteins showed that expression of cox-2 protein was increased in monocytes that were stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans- or p. gingivalis-lps, compared with that in unstimulated monocytes, whereas expression of cox-1 protein was not altered. northern blot analysis showed that monocytes stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans- or p. gingivalis-lps expressed cox-2 mrna, while cox-2 mrna was not detectable in unstimulated cells. treatment of a. actinomycetemcomitans-lps-stimulated monocytes with ns-398 induced a significant increase of il-1 beta production to the same extent as treatment with indomethacin. conclusions: these results suggest that cox-2 is induced in monocytes stimulated with lps derived from a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis and that the cox-2 is primarily responsible for pge2 production. cox-2 may be pivotal in pge2 production in periodontal lesions and may be involved in inflammatory responses.

TI  == differences in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of two periodontitis populations of different geographical origin. a comparison between spain and the  netherlands.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the subgingival microbiota of two geographically distinct patient populations using identical clinical and bacteriological methods. adult patients with a diagnosis of periodontitis were consecutively selected according to pre-defined clinical criteria. microbiological samples were taken from the deepest four sites with bleeding. the samples were plated on blood agar plates, for the determination of the total anaerobic counts and identification of specific bacterial pathogens, and on tsbv  and mcconkey for isolation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods, respectively. thirty-one patients in spain and 30 patients in the netherlands were selected. both patient groups showed similar clinical characteristics, both in terms of age, gender and periodontal clinical variables. a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent (23.3% vs. 3.2%) in the dutch group, while porphyromonas gingivalis was significantly more prevalent (64.5% vs. 36.7%) in the spanish group. bacteroides forsythus and most commensal  periodontal pathogens showed similar prevalences, except peptostreptococcus micros that was significantly more frequent in the dutch group (96.7% vs. 74.2%). in summary, the subgingival microbiota from the spanish group was characterised by a high prevalence of p. gingivalis and low of a. actinomycetemcomitans, while  the flora from the dutch group was characterised by a high prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. micros.

AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == enumeration of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples by a quantitative-competitive pcr method.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are believed to play an important role in adult periodontitis, but the significance of their relative numbers and progress of the disease is still unclear. traditional quantitative methods are generally time-consuming and inaccurate. the aim of this study was to develop a sensitive,  quantitative pcr technique that would be useful for enumerating p. gingivalis, pr. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples from subjects with adult periodontitis. primers to the following genes were employed:  the fimbrial gene (fima) of p. gingivalis, the 16s rrna gene of pr. intermedia and the leukotoxin-a (lkta) gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans. competitive templates were constructed either by sequence deletion between primer binding sites or by annealing of the primer binding sites to an appropriate dna core so as to yield products of a different size from that obtained with the target template. coamplification of target and competitive templates yielded products of expected size and non-specific recognition by the primers was not found. the sensitivity of the designed primers was 100 cells of p. gingivalis, 100 cells of  pr. intermedia and 10 cells of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the three species were found in subgingival plaque samples collected from both healthy and diseased sites by the quantitative-competitive (qc)-pcr method and the technique was more  sensitive than cultural methods. for determining the proportions of each of the three periodontopathogens, the total number of bacteria in the samples was enumerated by quantitative-pcr with 16s rrna universal primers (27f and 342r). the findings indicate that qc-pcr is a useful method for enumerating bacteria in  clinical oral specimens and the technique could play a role in the investigation  of disease progression.

TI  == detection of major putative periodontopathogens in korean advanced adult periodontitis patients using a nucleic acid-based approach.
AB  == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken  from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in  sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy  sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == clindamycin promotes phagocytosis and intracellular killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria by crevicular granulocytes: an in vitro study.
AB  == phagocytosis of periodontopathogenic bacteria by crevicular polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (pmns) plays a key role in the aetiology of periodontitis. antimicrobials such as clindamycin have been proven to be effective in treating progressive forms of this disease. therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of clindamycin on the phagocytosing properties of gingival crevicular pmns obtained from 16 patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp), eight with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), 12 with adult periodontitis (ap) and 13 periodontally healthy controls. the phagocytosis assay was performed with the two strains porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans tanner fdc 44 on a slide. phagocytosis and intracellular killing were assessed by fluorescence microscopy after staining with acridine orange. the addition of clindamycin elevated the percentage of phagocytosing pmns in periodontitis patients and controls regardless of whether p. gingivalis or a. actinomycetemcomitans was used as test strain. in granulocytes of healthy controls an enhancement of the intracellular killing of both strains was observed if clindamycin was added. besides the antimicrobial effect, the enhancement of the phagocytosis might be an additional indication for treatment of periodontitis patients with clindamycin.

TI  == a novel closed-tube quantitative--pcr method for enumerating porphyromonas gingivitis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == enumeration of specific periodontopathogens in subgingival plaque samples has been problematic because of either lack of sensitivity, specificity or the time taken to identify the organisms. these problems can be overcome using pcr, but quantification by this technique is more difficult. we report a simple quantitative pcr method developed for enumerating porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in clinical samples. the method relies upon inclusion of ethidium bromide in a closed-tube pcr reaction and measurement of resultant amplicons by quantifying the fluorescence generated when uv-light is passed through the walls of the amplification tube. hence, both pcr and detection are performed in the same tube. the technique was compared with a quantitative competitive pcr and a commercial colorimetric quantitative pcr and proved to be at least as sensitive, specific and reliable for enumeration of the target bacteria. however, its speed and convenience make it particularly useful for large-scale analyses in both clinical laboratories and epidemiological studies.

TI  == coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of coptidis rhizoma (cr), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. materials and methods: cr extract was prepared by boiling cr in water for 2 h. alkaloids contained in cr extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). antibacterial activity of cr extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (ic50). results: cr extract inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at mic of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (mic: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus. the major active component of cr extract was berberine (ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of cr extract. cr extract and ber were bacteriostatic at the mics against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the mics. ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: cr extract and ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. these results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == efficient antimicrobial treatment in periodontal maintenance care.
AB  == background: the goal of follow-up care after periodontal therapy is to preserve the function of individual teeth and the dentition, ameliorate symptoms and simplify future surgery or make it unnecessary. effective follow-up periodontal care depends on early diagnosis and treatment, as well as patient education. results: the main determinants of successful periodontal maintenance therapy are  dental professionals' ability to combat periodontal infections and patients' compliance with prescribed follow-up care. mechanical and chemical antimicrobial  intervention is the mainstay of preventive periodontal therapy. chemotherapeutics alone are unlikely to be effective in the presence of subgingival calculus, underscoring the importance of subgingival mechanical debridement. also, because  toothbrushing and rinsing alone do not reach pathogens residing in periodontal pockets of increased depths, oral hygiene procedures should include subgingival treatment with home irrigators or other appropriate self-care remedies. clinical  implications: when considering possible preventive therapies, dental professionals must weigh the risk of patients' acquiring destructive periodontal  disease against potentially adverse effects, financial costs and inconvenience of the preventive treatment. the authors discuss theoretical and practical aspects of follow-up care for patients with periodontal disease. in addition, because it  can be both difficult and expensive to control periodontal disease via conventional preventive measures alone, they present a new, simple and more cost-effective antimicrobial protocol for supportive periodontal therapy.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

TI  == prevalence of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival microflora of japanese patients with adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: this study investigated the prevalence of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans among various periodontitis patients and healthy individuals in japan, and correlated it with clinical parameters. method: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 21 patients with adult periodontitis (ap), 8 with rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp) and 15 healthy individuals. results: the frequency detected in culture was as follows: b. forsythus was found in 47.6% of  ap sites and in 37.5% of rpp sites. p. gingivalis was identified in 64.3% of ap and 59.4% of rpp sites. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 4.8% of ap and 3.1% of rpp sites. the 3 species were detected in only 2 of the healthy individuals. the proportion of b. forsythus in the total microflora in culture was 0.07% in the healthy group, 4.1% in ap and 2.4% in rpp. the proportions of p. gingivalis were 0% in the healthy group, 18.8% in ap and 16.2% in rpp. the proportion of a. actinomycetemcomitans was very low in all 3 groups. a dna probe  detected b. forsythus in 78.6% of ap and 65.6% of rpp sites, as well as p.gingivalis in 58.3% of ap and 59.4% of rpp sites. a. actinomycetemcomitans was  detected in only 1.2% of ap sites. the 3 species were undetectable in the healthy group. conclusions: the prevalence and the proportion of b. forsythus and p. gingivalis were significantly correlated with clinical parameters, suggesting that b. forsythus and p. gingivalis are closely related to ap and rpp in the japanese population.

TI  == influence of surface modifications to titanium on oral bacterial adhesion in vitro.
AB  == the influence of surface modifications to titanium on the initial adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis atcc33277 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc43718 was evaluated. surface modifications were performed with dry processes  including ion implantation (ca(+), n(+), f(+)), oxidation (anode oxidation, titania spraying), ion plating (tin, alumina), and ion beam mixing (ag, sn, zn, pt) with ar(+) on polished pure titanium plates. comparatively large amounts of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans adhered to polished titanium plates. the degree of p. gingivalis adhesion showed a positive correlation with surface energy and the amount of calcium-ion adsorption. adherence of both p. gingivalis  and a. actinomycetemcomitans increased on calcium-implanted surfaces compared with polished titanium surfaces, whereas adherence of p. gingivalis was remarkably decreased on alumina-coated surfaces. these findings indicate that titanium implants exposed to the oral cavity require surface modification to inhibit the adherence of oral bacteria, and that surface modification with a dry  process is useful in controlling the adhesion of oral bacteria as well as ensuring resistance against wear.

TI  == tetracycline fibres used to control bacterial infection during guided tissue regeneration (gtr).
AB  == aims: the colonization of suspected periodontal pathogens during the healing of periodontal defects treated by guided tissue regeneration (gtr) with e-ptfe membranes and tetracycline fibers was investigated. methods: fifteen patients, each with one pair of angular periodontal bone defects of comparable size and morphology were recruited for the study. in a matched-pair study design, the test defects were treated with e-ptfe membranes in combination with tetracycline fibers, while control defects were treated with e-ptfe membranes alone. microbiological specimens were taken from control as well as from test sites preoperatively (t0), intraoperatively (t1), two weeks after surgery (t2) and from membranes at time of removal (t3). cultural methods were used to identify the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and actinobacillus actinomicetemcomitans (aa). results: at baseline and t1, none of the suspected periodontal pathogens were detected at test or control sites. levels of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum, as mean percentages of total culturable microflora, were detected at levels significantly higher in control sites than test sites at times t2 and t3. conclusions: findings from this study suggest that e-ptfe membranes are frequently colonized by periodontal pathogens, and that bacterial colonization of healing sites after gtr procedures can be kept under control with a controlled delivery system releasing tetracycline.

TI  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans-associated peri-implantitis in an edentulous patient. a case report.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is a risk factor for implant loss. late bacterial infection of the peri-implant tissues and loss of alveolar bone in edentulous patients is caused by commensal oral anaerobic bacteria. in partially edentulous  patients, porphyromonas gingivalis and occasionally actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are associated with peri-implantitis lesions. aims: to investigate the microbiology of a peri-implantitis case in an edentulous patient. methods: anaerobic culture techniques and selective culture techniques for a. actinomycetemcomitans were used to study the peri-implant microflora at sites with and without bone loss. results: an anaerobic peri-implant microflora with several putative periodontal pathogens was found at sites with bone loss. furthermore, a metronidazole-resistant a. actinomycetemcomitans was isolated. the a. actinomycetemcomitans infection did not respond to systemic doxycycline therapy, despite good susceptibility in vitro. conclusions: the present case of severe a. actinomycetemcomitans-associated peri-implantitis shows the importance  of pre-operative infection control. the findings in this case show that remaining teeth affected by periodontitis can be a serious risk factor for peri-implantitis.

AB  == background: although herpesviruses have been associated with adult periodontitis, their relationship with juvenile periodontitis (jp) has not been established. this case-control study examined possible associations between jp and pathogenic  bacteria, the human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), and the epstein-barr type 1 virus (ebv-1). methods: subjects were participants in a larger survey of schoolchildren in north-central jamaica. subgingival plaque samples from 15 subjects with jp, 20 with incipient periodontitis (ip), and 65 randomly-selected healthy controls were assayed for porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans using a 16s rrna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification method, and for hcmv and ebv-1 using nested pcr identification. results: strong bivariate associations were found between jp and p. gingivalis (odds ratio [or] = 12.7; 95% ci = 2.6, 61.4), hcmv (or = 10.0; 95% ci = 2.7, 36.3), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (or = 8.0; 95% ci = 2.3, 27.5), but not ebv-1. in multivariate analyses, p. gingivalis remained a significant explanatory variable  (or = 7.8; 95% ci = 1.5, 40.9); however, the associations were marginal for hcmv  (or = 4.6; 95% ci = 0.9, 22.7), and non-significant for a. actinomycetemcomitans  (or = 2.0; 95% ci = 0.4, 9.7). the associations with jp and the extent of attachment loss were even stronger when both p. gingivalis and hcmv were detected together. p. gingivalis (or = 3.9; 95% ci = 1.3, 12.0) and ebv-1 (or = 3.3; 95% ci = 1.0, 10.3) were the only significant explanatory variables in the multivariate analysis of ip. conclusions: p. gingivalis is the strongest and most stable indicator of periodontitis in jamaican adolescents. co-infection with p. gingivalis and hcmv appears to be particularly deleterious to periodontal health.

TI  == occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in progressive adult periodontitis.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia are the major periodontal bacteria species in most forms of progressive periodontitis in scandinavia and the united states. the occurrence of periodontal pathogens appears to be different in subjects of different ethnic origin, and geographical factors may influence the distribution of these species. methods: the occurrence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia was determined using a dna probe in progressive adult periodontitis in chileans. sixty patients (mean age 43.6 +/- 8 years) who had not previously received any type of periodontal therapy were selected. bleeding on probing, probing depth, and clinical attachment level measurements were made with an automated probe. patients were monitored at 2-month intervals until at least 2 sites exhibited > or =2 mm attachment loss. two subgingival plaque samples from active sites were taken in 56 subjects and matched with 2 plaque samples from inactive sites in the same individuals. results: p. gingivalis was found in 75% of active sites and in 59.7% of inactive sites in 96% of the patients (p = 0.022). p. gingivalis at high levels of detection was significantly more frequent in active sites (48.2%) than in inactive sites (31.2%) (p = 0.014). a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 6.25% of active sites and in 12.5% of inactive sites in 11.6% of patients. p. intermedia was found in 33% of patients and at a significantly higher proportion in active sites (49.1%) than in inactive sites (30.3%) (p = 0.006). there was a significantly higher proportion of inactive sites (34.8%) than active sites (19.6%) without any of the 3 pathogens (p = 0.016). bleeding on probing was significantly more associated with active sites with high levels of p. gingivalis and with active sites with p. intermedia  than with inactive sites. conclusions: a high prevalence of p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia was found in adult periodontitis, and the occurrence of these bacteria appears to be higher in chileans than in other populations. no apparent association exists between a. actinomycetemcomitans and progressive adult periodontitis in chileans.

AB  == background: this study aimed to determine the relationships among interleukin (il)-8 and granulocyte elastase levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and the concomitant presence of periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis. methods: gcf and subgingival plaque samples were collected from 16 patients with  untreated adult periodontitis and 10 healthy control subjects. il-8 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). granulocyte elastase was analyzed with a neutrophilic granulocyte-specific, low molecular weight and chromogenic substrate, l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-valine-p-nitroanilide, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (mr-ea) was calculated. five dna probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), b. forsythus (b.f.), p. gingivalis (p.g.), p. intermedia (p.i.), and t. denticola (t.d.). results: lower il-8 concentrations and higher granulocyte elastase activities were found in patients than in healthy controls as well as in diseased conditions co-infected with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. as compared to healthy conditions without the target species (p <0.05). il-8 concentrations were positively correlated with mr-ea levels in the periodontitis conditions co-infected with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. (p <0.05). a wide range of il-8 concentrations was found among 15 patients when the periodontitis condition was characterized by co-infection with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. mr-ea levels in the high il-8 group  of subjects were significantly higher than those in the low il-8 group of subjects (p <0.01). conclusions: the present study shows that the local host-bacteria interactions in untreated periodontitis are diverse in terms of the intensity of inflammatory responses measured by il-8-related granulocyte elastase activity in gcf. this might reflect different phases of the inflammatory response due to shifts in host-bacteria interactions and therefore be indicative of a range of periodontal disease activity levels.

TI  == metabolic diseases and their possible link to risk indicators of periodontitis.
AB  == background: during the last few years, risk assessment has become one of the main topics of periodontal research. therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether a predisposition to metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus (in the absence of diagnosed diabetic disease) or hyperlipidemia may be risk indicators for periodontitis. methods: one hundred patients ranging in age from 40 to 70 years were examined. the patients were classified as having impaired glucose tolerance (igt) but no manifest diabetes (56 patients), hyperlipidemia (17 patients, hl), or normal metabolic status (27 control patients). probing depth (pd), attachment level (al), plaque index (pi), and gingival bleeding on probing  (bop) were recorded. serum antibody titers (sat) to a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), p. intermedia (p.i.), and p. gingivalis (p.g.) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). pooled subgingival plaque samples were analyzed using indirect immunofluorescence to detect the same organisms. in addition, respiratory burst activity of peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) was evaluated by chemiluminescence (cl). results: no significant differences were observed between the igt group and normal controls in the following parameters: 1) percentage of sites exhibiting bop; 2) mean pi; 3) mean  pd and al; 4) percentage of periodontal microorganisms; and 5) increased sat. the igt probands exhibited a significantly higher mean serum level of triglycerides,  as well as higher formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fmlp)-stimulated pmn chemiluminescence than the control group. patients with hyperlipidemia (hl) showed a significantly higher number of sextants with increased pd (73.4%) than the control group (50.6%). similar results were obtained when comparing the percentage of all sites with increased pd (hl = 16.7%, control 12.3%). the mean fmlp-stimulated cl in patients with hyperlipidemia was significantly higher than  the control group. when looking at all patients, there was a small but statistically significant correlation between pd and lipid levels. in addition, a significant correlation was observed between lipid serum levels and the fmlp-stimulated chemiluminescence. conclusions: these findings suggest that abnormal glucose tolerance, which is a predisposing factor for diabetes mellitus, does not appear to be a risk indicator for periodontal disease. on the other hand, impaired lipid metabolism does seem to be a risk indicator for periodontitis.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == a rapid dna probe method for detection of porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: the objective of the present study was to develop a rapid dna probe method for the microbiological detection of periodontitis that can be used in dental clinics. by using the dna probe, we also investigated the correlation between the occurrence of putative periodontopathic bacteria and clinical parameters. methods: this rapid dna probe method minimizes the use of a water bath for ordinary hybridization and washing in order to shorten the total reaction time. the detection process could be completed within 2 hours. in order  to evaluate the clinical application of the dna probe, subgingival plaque samples were taken from patients with periodontitis before initial therapy. after the therapy, the patients were microbiologically and clinically evaluated. results: when the dna probe method was compared with the culture method, the agreement was 88% for porphyromonas gingivalis and 67% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. a statistically significant association was found between  the detection of p. gingivalis and probing depth, bleeding on probing (chi2 test: p <0.001, p <0.05). a significant association was also shown between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and probing depth in patients aged 35 or older (chi2 test: p <0.001). the detection rate of a. actinomycetemcomitans was highest in teenagers. at shallow periodontal pocket sites (pd < or =3 mm) in teenagers, no p. gingivalis was found, while 22% of the sites harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans. after the therapy, the frequency of detection of p. gingivalis decreased significantly only in the clinically improved sites (chi2 test: p <0.001). conclusions: the rapid dna probe method appears promising as an  efficient tool for rapid clinical detection of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and colonization by porphyromonas gingivalis  and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in children.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are closely associated with the onset and severity of adult periodontal disease. however, little is known regarding the colonization by, and host antibody response to, these microorganisms in children. methods: plaque and sera were obtained from 40 healthy children, 2 to 18 years old. gingival health was assessed by the periodontal disease index (pdi), papillary bleeding score (bs) and the modified total papillary margin attachment index (m-pma). p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans in plaque samples were detected by slot immunoblotting (sib). serum antibody levels against these microorganisms were evaluated using elisa. results: more than 60% of the children had detectable levels of p. gingivalis in their plaque. those having detectable levels had more  gingival inflammation than those having none; however, these differences were significant only in children over the age of 12 years (pdi, bs). in contrast, while 75% of the children had detectable a. actinomycetemcomitans, there were significant differences in gingival inflammation associated with colonization in  children from 3 to 7 years of age (pdi) and over 12 years of age (m-pma). serum antibody levels to p. gingivalis were inversely correlated with gingival inflammation in all age groups, while a. actinomycetemcomitans titers were positively correlated with gingival inflammation only in the children over 12 years. no significant relationship between the presence of either a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis and antibodies to them was found. conclusions: our findings show that p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans are readily detected as early as 3 years of age and that their presence is associated with the onset and severity of gingivitis.

TI  == changes in the periodontal status of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.
AB  == background: patients receiving an hla-matched bone marrow transplant (bmt) from a relative or unrelated donor undergo a permanent alteration of their immune system, followed by a prolonged period of immunodeficiency. this study aimed to examine alterations in the periodontal status of patients over 6 months post-bone marrow transplantation. methods: thirty-seven patients scheduled for bone marrow  transplantation participated in this study. one calibrated examiner carried out periodontal examinations (clinical and radiographic) immediately prior to and at  3 and 6 months after transplantation. all patients followed an intense oral care  program. subgingival plaque samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (elisa) for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia. data were subjected to statistical analyses to determine the relationships between the frequency distribution of the radiographic and clinical variables over time. results: gains in clinical attachment level (cal) of > or =2 mm at 4 or more sites from baseline to 6 months post-bmt were noted in 9/16 patients (56%), while 6/16 (38%) patients experienced a loss of cal > or =2 mm at 4 or more sites in the same period. at a  site level, 4.8% of sites exhibited a gain in cal > or =2 mm between baseline and 3 months post-bmt while 2.3% of sites showed a loss of cal > or =2 mm in the same period. from baseline to 6 months, a gain in cal of > or =2 mm was recorded at 3.1% of sites, and 2.4% of sites experienced a loss of > or =2 mm. a significant  improvement in the gingival index occurred between all sequential time periods when assessed at a site level. at a patient level, 11/18 (61%) patients showed a  significant change in gingival index between baseline and 3 months and 10/16 (63%) between baseline and 6 months. there was no significant relationship between clinical changes and the prevalence of the periodontal pathogens at the various time periods. conclusions: an improvement in periodontal health was recorded between baseline and 6 months post-transplantation. most of the improvement in periodontal status was noted in the first 3 months after bmt, with a slight decline in periodontal health between 3 and 6 months post-transplant. no significant alteration was noted in the prevalence of periodontal pathogens during the study period.

TI  == large-scale synthesis and functional elements for the antimicrobial activity of defensins.
AB  == human neutrophil defensins, and their analogues incorporating anionic, hydrophobic or cationic residues at the n- and c-termini, were synthesized by solid-phase procedures. the synthetic defensins were examined for their microbicidal activity against candida albicans, two gram-negative bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis) and two gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans). the human neutrophil peptide 1 (hnp1) and hnp2 were found to be potent candidacidal agents. hnp3, which differs by one amino acid at the n-terminus of its sequence,  was totally inactive. the gram-negative bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans and p.  gingivalis and the gram-positive bacteria s. gordonii and s. mutans were insensitive to human defensins. however, the insertion of two basic residues, such as arginine, at both the n-terminus and the c-terminus of hnp2 significantly enhanced antifungal and antibacterial activity. the addition of anionic residues, such as aspartic acid, at the n- and c-termini rendered the molecule totally inactive. the presence of two hydrophobic amino acids, such as valine, at the n-terminus of hnp2 and of two basic arginine residues at its c-terminus resulted  in molecules that were optimally active against these oral pathogens. the results suggest that the n- and c-terminal residues in defensin peptides are the crucial  functional elements that determine their microbicidal potency. the three-dimensional structure of all defensins constitutes the same amphiphilic beta-sheet structure, with the polar face formed by the n- and c-terminal residues playing an important role in defining microbicidal potency and the antimicrobial spectrum. the enhanced microbicidal activity observed for defensin  peptides with two basic residues at both the n- and c-termini could be due to optimization of the amphiphilicity of the structure, which could facilitate specific interactions with the microbial membranes.

TI  == anaerobic neutrophil-dependent killing of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in relation to the bacterial leukotoxicity.
AB  == the effect of leukotoxin on the interaction of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) was studied  under anaerobic conditions with strains able to produce high or low amounts of leukotoxin. pmnl morphology, phagocytosis and killing were examined by transmission electron microscopy and bioassays, respectively. at ratios of > or =25 bacteria/pmnl, a highly toxic a. actinomycetemcomitans strain completely destroyed the pmnl within 7 min, resulting in bacterial survival. lowering the bacteria/pmnl-ratio enabled phagocytosis and killing of this highly toxic strain. a. actinomycetemcomitans strains with low leukotoxicity were effectively killed by pmnl under any condition. presence of specific antibodies against a. actinomycetemcomitans or of anti-leukotoxin serum protected pmnl from being injured and allowed phagocytosis to occur. pre-incubation of the leukotoxic strain with porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium that destroys leukotoxin, abolished lysis of pmnl and inhibited phagocytosis of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the results show that leukotoxin may protect a. actinomycetemcomitans against phagocytosis by human pmnl. the protection occurs at a population level and in relation to the bacterial load. the size of the bacterial population required to  counteract phagocytosis is dependent on the leukotoxin production of the strain.

TI  == the microbiology of periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontal disease result from mixed bacterial infections, in which both host resistance barriers and bacterial interactions are important. approximately ten bacterial species are strongly implicated with various forms of periodontal disease, although species that cannot yet be cultivated are likely also to be relevant. new technologies have shown that pathogenic bacterial species are present in defined complexes within subgingival plaque, thus identifying specific targets for therapeutic intervention. in light of increasing antibiotic resistance amongst oral bacteria, new strategies for control of periodontal bacterial complexes must be developed that inhibit the bacterial factors necessary for colonization and destruction of host tissues.

TI  == adherence of periodontopathic bacteria to bioabsorbable and non-absorbable barrier membranes in vitro.
AB  == guided tissue regeneration (gtr) techniques are increasingly used for the treatment of periodontal defects, or in conjunction with dental implant procedures. as adhesion of bacteria to barrier membranes used in these techniques may lead to failure, a prerequisite for treatment success is an infection-free healing process. the present study examined the adhesion of 3 periodontal pathogenic bacteria: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis, to 3 barrier membranes: collagen, (biomend) ptfe, (tefgen-fd) and e-ptfe, (gore-tex). the membranes were incubated with 3[h]-thymidine labeled bacteria, and the number of adherent bacteria was calculated using a scintillation counter. the effect of albumin coating on bacterial adherence to the membranes was also studied. bacterial adherence to the membranes was further examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the results show that the adherence of all bacterial strains to collagen membranes was significantly higher than to the other membranes tested. precoating of the membranes with albumin did not change the bacterial adherence significantly. these findings are of importance in evaluating the ability of periodontal bacteria to colonize and infect different types of barrier membranes.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in children with down syndrome.
AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == acquisition and colonization stability of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in children.
AB  == the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to be a risk factor for periodontitis in adults, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has been implicated as a pathogen in early-onset periodontitis. both species have been shown to establish stable colonization in adults. in cross-sectional studies, both a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis have been detected in over one-third of apparently healthy children. information on the stability of colonization with these organisms in children could help to elucidate the natural history of the development of periodontitis. for this purpose, samples previously collected from a cohort of 222 children between the ages of 0 and 18 years and previously examined for the presence of p. gingivalis with a pcr-based assay were examined for the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. it was detected in 48% of  subjects and, like p. gingivalis, was found at similar frequencies among children of all ages (p = 0.53), suggesting very early initial acquisition. one hundred one of the original subjects were recalled after 1 to 3 years to determine the continuing presence of both a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis. the prevalence of both species remained unchanged at resampling. however, in most children both species appeared to colonize only transiently, with random concordance between the results of the first and second sampling. stability of colonization was unrelated to age for a. actinomycetemcomitans, but p. gingivalis was more stable in the late teenage years.

TI  == persistence patterns of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, and actinobacillus actinomyetemcomitans after mechanical therapy of periodontal disease.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to determine the distribution patterns of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in periodontitis patients after standard mechanical periodontal therapy, and to determine factors increasing the odds to detect these target organisms in treated sites. methods: eight hundred fifty-two (852) separate subgingival microbial samples were taken from the mesial and distal aspects of every tooth in 17 patients. target organisms were identified culturally. results: the 3 microorganisms showed different persistence patterns:  p. gingivalis was detected in a high percentage of subjects (59%), but in a low proportion of sites (5.4%). p. intermedia/nigrescens was detected in all subjects except one, and in 40.6% of the tested sites. only 5 subjects were a. actinomycetemcomitans positive, but 2 of them showed a very high number of positive sites (44% and 75%, respectively). a highly significant relationship was found between a subject's tendency to bleed upon sampling and the number of p. intermedia/nigrescens-positive sites. a significant portion of the variation in frequency of persisting p. gingivalis could be explained by the frequency of persisting pockets deeper than 4 mm. no similar relationship could be established between clinical parameters and a. actinomycetemcomitans. on a site level, the odds of detecting p. gingivalis increased by a factor of 2.47 (p= 0.0001) for every millimeter of residual probing depth; the odds of detecting p. intermedia/nigrescens increased by a factor of 1.84 (p= 0.0001). conclusions: if, after standard mechanical periodontal therapy, a large number of sites continue to bleed, one may expect an increased number of sites positive for p. intermedia/ nigrescens. if many deep pockets persist, a greater number of p. gingivalis-positive sites can be expected.

TI  == synthesis, microbicidal activity, and solution structure of the dodecapeptide from bovine neutrophils.
AB  == the dodecapepetide sequence r-l-c-r-i-v-v-i-r-v-c-r with a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues found in bovine neutrophils was synthesized by solid-phase procedures. its antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus gordonii was examined, and its structural features were examined by cd and determined by two-dimensional (2d) nmr. the strains p. gingivalis (w50 and 381), a. actinomycetemcomitans (y4 and 67), s. gordonii (dl1), and s. mutans (gs5) are found to be highly sensitive to this peptide at 2-2.5 microm concentrations, suggesting that the dodecapeptide is a potent antibiotic for oral pathogens. the weak negative n-sigma* band observed at approximately 265-270 nm in the cd spectra of this peptide provides evidence for  the presence of a disulfide bridge. the negative n-pi* band at approximately 200  nm and the positive pi-pi* band at 185 nm suggest a folded structure for this peptide. the negative n-pi* shifts from 200 to 206 nm with an increase in intensity in dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine vesicles, suggesting that the peptide might associate to form higher order aggregates in lipid medium. the assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances has been accomplished by the combined analysis of 2d total correlated and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy. the temperature dependence of amide nh chemical shifts and (1)h-(2)h exchange effect on amide nh resonances indicate the involvement of amide nh groups of cys3, ile5, ile8, val10, and arg12 in intramolecular hydrogen  bonding. the coupling constant (j(nh-c(alpha)h)) values, the set of medium-, short-, and long-range nuclear overhauser effects, and the results of restrained  structure calculation using the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications  provide evidence for a folded, loop-like structure with a type i (iii) beta-turn  involving ile5, val6, val7, and ile8, and two antiparallel beta-strands involving the n-terminal arg1, leu2, cys3, and val4 and the c-terminal arg9, val10, cys11,  and arg12 residues. the structure of the dodecapeptide mimics the amphiphilic structure of large 30-35 residue defensins and the peptide appears to exhibit similar antimicrobial potency.

TI  == periodontal pathogens stimulate cc-chemokine production by mononuclear and bone-derived cells.
AB  == background: chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that stimulate recruitment of leukocytes. monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, and rantes (regulated on activation, normal t cell expressed, and secreted) are 3 well-characterized cc-chemokines that regulate mononuclear cell recruitment. the recruitment of inflammatory cells is of particular importance in the oral cavity because of the likelihood that cells will be challenged with bacteria either during acute infection or following surgical procedures. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are putative periodontal pathogens that may be harbored in subgingival and supragingival plaque. the capacity of the host to respond to these bacteria by the elaboration  of chemoattractants may represent an important defense mechanism. methods: in the present study, we examined cc-chemokine production by human mononuclear cells and bone-derived cells in response to p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and lipopolysaccharides (lps) stimulation in vitro. the chemokines produced were measured by elisa. results: the results demonstrate that p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans induce high levels of mip-1alpha in mononuclear cells. p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated high levels of mcp-1 in bone-derived cells and induced moderate levels of rantes production in both mononuclear and osteoblastic cells. in mononuclear cells, lps induced high levels of mip-1alpha and rantes and moderate levels of mcp-1; in osteoblasts lps only induced mcp-1. conclusions: the capacity of bacteria to induce a given chemokine  depends upon the cell type stimulated. that different cell types would exhibit differences in the cc-chemokines produced under the same stimulus provides a mechanism to explain tissue-specific recruitment of leukocytes.

TI  == the limited value of three pathogen species in predicting healing of periodontal  pockets.
AB  == baseline level of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has been suggested as being predictive of periodontal treatment outcome. we analyzed the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in 55 deep periodontal pockets of 29 patients (18 men, 11 women, 37-75 years) before and after periodontal treatment. at baseline and after treatment, 62% and 33%, respectively, of the subjects presented with 1, 2, or a combination  of all 3 pathogens. the mean pocket depth of 6.6 mm (0.4 mm) before treatment decreased to 2.2 mm (0.4 mm) in response to treatment (p<0.001). the treatment plan of non-surgical or surgical treatment was based on pocket depths and tooth morphology only. no antimicrobial medications were used during the treatment. eighty-two percent of the deep pockets healed satisfactorily to < or = 4 mm. the  presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, or prevotella intermedia at baseline was not associated with the outcome of the periodontal therapy. in conclusion, we found that the presence of the 3 periodontopathogen species had little or no value in predicting healing of periodontal pockets.

AB  == 4 patients, 2 pairs of siblings, suffering from papillon-lefevre syndrome were treated for periodontal disease. following extraction of hopeless teeth, the children received scaling and adjunctive systemic antibiotics (metronidazole and  amoxicillin for 7 to 10 days). in addition, they performed supragingival pulsated jet irrigation with 0.06% chlorhexidine digluconate 1 x daily. in 2 siblings, a.  actinomycetemcomitans was suppressed subgingivally below detectable levels, pocket probing depths were reduced to 4 mm or less, and plaque and bleeding indices were low. no further disease progression was seen over a 3-year-period. another female patient also showed clinical improvement and suppression of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus up to the 9-month-follow-up, while her sister showed further attachment loss over the course of 4 years. the present case reports indicated that in some patients suffering from papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontal disease may be arrested by means of (i) oral hygiene instruction, (ii) extraction of severely diseased teeth, (iii) scaling, (iv) systemic antibiotics and (v) long-term antimicrobial irrigation.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of local antibiotic  therapy with metronidazole adjunctively to scaling and root planing (srp) versus  mechanical treatment alone. 30 maintenance-patients were included in this single-blind study. the subjects had to comply with the following criteria: 2 non-adjacent sites with a probing depth > or =6 mm with bleeding on probing in separate quadrants, no periodontal therapy within the last 3 months, and no antibiotic therapy within the last 6 months. after randomization, the study sites were assigned to one of the following 2 treatments: srp plus subgingival application of metronidazole 25% dental gel (elyzol) 5x during 10 days (test site) or srp alone (control site). subgingival microbiological samples were taken prior to, and 21 days and 3 months after scaling. the samples were analyzed with  a commercial chair-side elisa (evalusite) for porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. probing pocket depth (ppd), attachment level (al) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded at baseline and 3 months later. ppd reduction and al-gain were statistically significant (p<0.001) after both treatments. however, there were no statistically significant differences between them. the same observation was made for bop. p. gingivalis was reduced significantly after both treatments without statistically  significant differences. p. intermedia was reduced significantly only after srp.  a. actinomycetemcomitans was not reduced significantly after either treatment. in conclusion, the repeated local application of metronidazole as an adjunct to srp  and the mechanical treatment alone showed similar clinical and microbiological effects without statistically significant differences with the exception of p. intermedia.

TI  == sampling of periodontal pathogens by paper points: evaluation of basic parameters.
AB  == paper points are widely established for the collection of subgingival plaque or other oral samples to analyze the microbiota, especially the presence of periodontal pathogenic bacteria such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis. in contrast to the high frequency of usage of paper points in oral sampling, very few data are available about the parameters influencing the sampling process. therefore, in four different in vitro experiments (6-9 repeats), we inoculated paper points with standardized suspensions (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units/ml) of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis to test the influence of the origin (kind) of paper point ("manufacturer"), size (according to the international organization for standardization iso 25-80), sampling time (5 to 60 s), and elution time (5 to 60  s). sampled bacteria were detected and (semi-) quantified using 16s rrna/dna-directed oligonucleotide probes. the bacterial load was categorized and  calculations performed with index values ranging between 0 (below the detection limit of 10(2) to 10(3) colony-forming units) and 9 (> 10(6) colony-forming units). we found statistically significant differences in the efficiency of bacterial sampling between the 5 paper point manufacturers tested, expressed in a mean bacterial index between 4.4 and 7.8. iso 45 paper points were statistically  proven to work most efficiently. according to our results, a sampling time of 60  s seems to be optimum. however, shorter times between 5 and 30 s did not significantly reduce the sampling efficiency. we found an interval of 20 s best to elute bacteria from the paper points by vortexing. the evaluation of basic parameters for subgingival plaque sampling by paper points might help to optimize microbiologically based diagnostics in periodontal diseases.

TI  == microbial findings at failing implants.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate qualitative differences in the subgingival  microbiota at titanium implants, ad modum branemark, demonstrating clinical and radiographic signs of loss of supporting tissues (peri-implantitis) as compared to implants surrounded by healthy tissues. a total of 37 patients demonstrating 1 or more implants with bone loss > or = 3 threads, bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and 51 patients with clinically healthy mucosa and no bone loss were  recruited for the study. in each patient subgingival bacterial samples were obtained using paper-points, and subjected to microbiological analysis by culture. the two types of clinical conditions showed distinct bacterial profiles. for implants with peri-implantitis putative periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were found in 60% of the cases and microorganisms primarily not associated with periodontitis, such as staphylococcus spp., enterics and candida spp., were found in 55% of the peri-imaplant lesions. in contrast, implants surrounded by healthy tissue demonstrated a microbiota associated with periodontal health. the results indicate that the microbiota of the healthy peri-implant sulci is similar to that from corresponding conditions around teeth. however, in peri-implant areas staphylococci, enterics and yeasts were found almost as frequently as periopathogens indicating differences as compared to the microbiota around periodontitis affected teeth. a microbiological diagnosis may therefore be of guidance for the choice of antimicrobial treatment in patients with peri-implant  infection.

TI  == improved multiplex pcr using conserved and species-specific 16s rrna gene primers for simultaneous detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == among putative periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis are most convincingly implicated as etiological agents in periodontitis. therefore, techniques for detection of those three species would be of value. we previously published a description of a multiplex pcr that detects a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis. the present paper presents an improvement on that technique, which now allows more sensitive detection of all three periodontal pathogens. sensitivity was determined by testing serial dilutions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis cells. primer specificity  was tested against (i) all gene sequences from the genbank-embl database, (ii) six a. actinomycetemcomitans, one b. forsythus, and four p. gingivalis strains, (iii) eight different species of oral bacteria, and (iv) supra- and subgingival plaque samples from 20 healthy subjects and subgingival plaque samples from 10 patients with periodontitis. the multiplex pcr had a detection limit of 10 a. actinomycetemcomitans, 10 p. gingivalis, and 100 b. forsythus cells. specificity  was confirmed by the fact that (i) none of our forward primers were homologous to the 16s rrna genes of other oral species, (ii) amplicons of predicted size were detected for all a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis strains tested, and (iii) no amplicons were detected for the eight other bacterial species. a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis were detected in 6 of 20, 1 of 20, and 11 of 20 of supragingival plaque samples, respectively, and 4 of 20, 7 of 20, and 13 of 20 of subgingival plaque samples, respectively, from periodontally healthy subjects. among patients with periodontitis, the organisms were detected in 7 of 10, 10 of 10, and 7 of 10 samples, respectively. the simultaneous detection of three periodontal pathogens  is an advantage of this technique over conventional pcr assays.

TI  == oral ecology and person-to-person transmission of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the ecological characteristics of the oral cavity are dissimilar for a. actinomycetemcomitans and for p. gingivalis, as judged by differences in their colonization preferences and patterns, associations with periodontal disease parameters, relationships with the subgingival microbiota and the type of periodontitis and their clonal persistence in the oral cavity. these features also suggest that as a periodontal pathogen, a. actinomycetemcomitans is different from p. gingivalis. probably in most infected individuals, low levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans can persist for years in equilibrium with the host and the resident oral microbiota. however, it is well established that a. actinomycetemcomitans can cause disease in some individuals or in some circumstances when the regulatory mechanisms are unable to maintain homeostasis in the ecosystem. elevated a. actinomycetemcomitans proportions of the biota can  be regarded as a sign of ecological imbalance, leading to increased risk of periodontal destruction. there is also evidence showing elevated pathogenic potential of certain a. actinomycetemcomitans clones. although a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be relatively rarely transmitted between cohabiting adults, transmission can occur to periodontally healthy children of a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive parents. parents and children may share factors that promote successful oral colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans, or the window of opportunity is in childhood. therefore, to prevent parent-child transmission of a. actinomycetemcomitans, bacterium-positive parents of young children are optimal targets for enhanced information and treatment. in selected  populations, screening for specific clones of a. actinomycetemcomitans has been employed in prevention of peridontitis. future research aiming at finding the reasons which cause the changes in the oral homeostasis to allow the growth of a. actinomycetemcomitans may give insight into novel prevention strategies for a. actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis. compared with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis shows a different pattern of coexistence with the host. in periodontal health or in children, p. gingivalis is absent or only rarely detected. when present, p. gingivalis is commonly recovered in high numbers from dentitions exhibiting inflamed periodontitis and poor oral hygiene.  contrary to a. actinomycetemcomitans, the data on the vertical transmission of p. gingivalis are limited. the major infection route of p. gingivalis seems to be between adults, indicating that p. gingivalis commonly colonizes in an established oral microbiota. these characteristics suggest that the degree of tolerance between p. gingivalis and the host is inferior to that between a. actinomycetemcomitans and the host. it appears that the association of p. gingivalis with disease is a rule rather than an accidental incident. on these grounds, it seems that the host-p. gingivalis relationship approaches antibiosis. since p. gingivalis infection is related to a typical periodontal eco-pathology,  the susceptibility to person-to-person transmission of this pathogen may be controlled by periodontal treatment and emphasizing the significance of high standard oral hygiene.

TI  == microbiological features of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == papillon-lefevre syndrome patients exhibit hyperkeratosis palmo-plantaris and severe periodontitis. the syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait, but the mechanism of periodontal destruction is not known. this report presents the clinical and microbiological features of an 11-year old girl with papillon-lefevre syndrome. clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. in samples from 3 deep periodontal lesions, the occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification, and the presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus by a nested-pcr detection method. 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. major cultivable bacteria included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens were identified by pcr analysis. the patient's non-affected parents and older brother revealed several periodontal pathogens but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. the viral examination demonstrated cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus in the subgingival sample of the papillon-lefevre syndrome patient. the father and brother yielded subgingival cytomegalovirus but  not epstein-barr type 1 virus. we hypothesize that human herpesviruses in concert with a. actinomycetemcomitans play important roles in the development of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == microbiological response of localized sites with recurrent periodontitis in maintenance patients treated with tetracycline fibers.
AB  == background: whether adjunctive tetracycline fibers can provide an additive effect to scaling and root planing in treating non-responsive sites in maintenance subjects is still controversial. recolonization of the bacteria from untreated sites or from the extracrevicular region may explain the insignificant response to local therapy. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological response of sites treated with tetracycline fibers combined with  scaling and root planing. methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. thirty patients on maintenance therapy having at least 2 non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants with probing depths between 4 to 8 mm with bleeding on probing, or aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels > 800 microiu in the gingival crevicular fluid, were treated with scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers or with scaling and root planing only. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment. a. actino-mycetemcomitans, c. rectus, b. forsythus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia were detected by culture, immunofluorescence, or pcr technique. results: there was a reduction of total bacterial cell count, as well as of certain periodontal pathogens, following treatment. the prevalence of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis and the mean proportions of c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and p. gingivalis decreased after therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to bacterial proportions or the number of positive sites. besides, the pathogens could not be eliminated from the periodontal pocket, and recolonization of the pocket was noted at 3 months post-treatment. conclusions: bacteria located within the cheek, tongue mucosa, saliva, or untreated sites may contribute to reinfection of the pockets and explain the insignificant response to local tetracycline therapy.

TI  == granulocyte elastase activity and pge2 levels in gingival crevicular fluid in relation to the presence of subgingival periodontopathogens in subjects with untreated adult periodontitis.
AB  == this study aimed to determine the association between the levels of granulocyte elastase and prostaglandin e2 (pge2) in gce and the concomitant presence of periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis (ap). gcf and subgingival plaque were sampled by paper strips and paper points respectively, from various periodontal sites in 16 ap subjects. granulocyte elastase activity in gcf was analyzed with a low molecular weight substrate specific for granulocyte elastase, pgluproval-pna, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (mr-ea, mabs/min/site)  was calculated. pge2 levels in gcf were determined by radioimmunoassay. 5 species-specific dna probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomyceterncomitans (a.a., atcc 43718), b. forsythus (b.f, atcc 43037), p. gingivalis (p.g., atcc 33277), p. intermedia (p.i., atcc 33563), and t. denticola (t.d., atcc 35405), with a sensitivity of 10(3) cells/paper point. no a.a. was detectable from all sites sampled. the predominant combination of species detected was b.f., p.g., p.i. & t.d. and it was significantly higher at periodontitis sites (68%) than at healthy (7%) or gingivitis sites (29%) (p<0.05). overall, mr-ea values were strongly correlated with pge2 levels (r=0.655, p<0.001), especially at these periodontitis sites co-infected by b.f.,  p.g., p.i. & t.d. (r=0.722, p<0.001). the periodontitis sites co-infected by the  4 species were observable from 15 subjects. these sites were sub-grouped into 8 subjects with a high mr-ea and 7 subjects with a low mr-ea. the pge2 levels in the high mr-ea group were significantly higher than in the low mr-ea group (p<0.05). no significant differences in clinical or bacterial data were found between the two groups. while within the high mr-ea group, similar results were found between the paired periodontitis sites in each subject with highest and lowest mr-ea values. this study shows that the local host response to bacterial challenge in untreated periodontal pockets is diverse in terms of the intensity of inflammatory response measured by granulocyte elastase and pge2 levels in gce  a more thorough evaluation of the risk for active periodontal disease may involve the combined approaches to the test of the dynamic bacteria-host relations.

TI  == role of oral bacteria in respiratory infection.
AB  == an association between oral conditions such as periodontal disease and several respiratory conditions has been noted. for example, recent evidence has suggested a central role for the oral cavity in the process of respiratory infection. oral  periodontopathic bacteria can be aspirated into the lung to cause aspiration pneumonia. the teeth may also serve as a reservoir for respiratory pathogen colonization and subsequent nosocomial pneumonia. typical respiratory pathogens have been shown to colonize the dental plaque of hospitalized intensive care and  nursing home patients. once established in the mouth, these pathogens may be aspirated into the lung to cause infection. other epidemiologic studies have noted a relationship between poor oral hygiene or periodontal bone loss and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. several mechanisms are proposed to explain the potential role of oral bacteria in the pathogenesis of respiratory infection: 1. aspiration of oral pathogens (such as porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, etc.) into the lung to cause infection; 2. periodontal disease-associated enzymes in saliva may modify mucosal surfaces to promote adhesion and colonization by respiratory pathogens, which are then aspirated into the lung; 3. periodontal disease-associated enzymes may destroy salivary pellicles on pathogenic bacteria to hinder their clearance from the mucosal surface; and 4. cytokines originating from periodontal tissues may alter respiratory epithelium to promote infection by respiratory pathogens.

TI  == longitudinal effect of non-surgical treatment and systemic metronidazole for 1 week in smokers and non-smokers with refractory periodontitis: a 5-year study.
AB  == background: periodontitis consists of a mixture of diseases, most of which respond favorably to traditional mechanical therapy. it is now recognized that advanced periodontitis does not always respond to conventional management with scaling, periodontal surgery, and oral hygiene measures. however, various types of antibiotics given systemically or locally improve the success rate of periodontal therapy. in short-term studies, it has been shown that metronidazole, when systemically administered after debridement, resulted in treatment benefits  including less need for surgical intervention. methods: in this double-blind study, we evaluated periodontal treatment involving initial non-surgical treatment, systemic administration of metronidazole for 1 week, and then follow-ups for scaling and root planing every 6 months, for 5 years. the study population consisted of 64 subjects (37 smokers and 27 non-smokers), mean age 36.3 (+/-3.0 sd) years, with severe periodontal disease. after initial scaling and root planing, patients were randomly assigned to the intervention or placebo  groups: 400 mg metronidazole or a placebo administered at 8-hour intervals for 1  week. the participants underwent an extensive clinical periodontal examination. gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) was analyzed for spirochetes and granulocytes. samples were cultured for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg.), and prevotella intermedia (pi.). results: the number of patients infected with a.a., pg., pi., and spirochetes decreased during the study. most patients who harbored spirochetes at the end of the study had these microorganisms at the beginning. smokers responded less favorably to periodontal therapy than non-smokers. non-smoking patients who required only non-surgical therapy in the intervention group showed statistically significant improvement in the clinical parameters after 5 years. patients with complete healing, defined as the absence of inflamed sites > or =5 mm, after 5 years were  found only in the intervention group. the patients considered healthy after 5 years were the same patients found to be healthy after 6 months. conclusions: decisive factors in the sustained long-term improvement of patients who respond satisfactorily to treatment are probably initial scaling and root planing; a brief course of metronidazole; and regular follow-up examinations at 6-month intervals for oral hygiene and scaling and root planing.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in patients with adult periodontitis. a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological  effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid in adult periodontitis patients using a double-blind, parallel-group, and placebo-controlled protocol. 21 patients with a clinical diagnosis of generalised adult periodontitis were recruited. clinical measurements and microbiological assessments were carried out at baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. approximately 6 weeks after initial periodontal treatment (3-6 h), patients were randomly assigned to receive coded study medication of 500 mg amoxicillin plus 125 mg clavulanic acid (augmentin) or placebo, every 8 h for 10 days. patients returned for follow-up visits 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after completion of the medication. the mean plaque index (pi) at baseline was 1.1 for placebo group and 0.9 for the test group. at 3 months, the pi had dropped to 0.3 in both groups, and was maintained during the rest of the study. the changes in bleeding on probing (bop) and gingival index (gi) in the course of the study were similar in both groups. the mean whole mouth probing pocket depth (ppd) in the placebo group was 3.8 mm at baseline and 3.9 mm in the  test group. a mean reduction of 1.0 mm in the placebo group and 0.9 mm in the test group was observed during the first 3 months. no further reduction in ppd was noticed during the study period in either group. there was no statistically significant difference in the ppd reduction between the 2 groups. the change in clinical attachment level (cal) from baseline to 3 months amounted to 0.5 mm in both groups. between 3 and 12 months, the cal changed in neither group. in both groups, treatment resulted in a decrease in the number of spirochetes and motile  rods in positive patients, but no significant differences between either group were noted in any of the dark field microscopy observations. at baseline, 1 patient in the placebo group and 2 patients in the test group were culture positive for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). after therapy, aa was not detectable in the placebo group and 1 patient remained positive in the test group. in the placebo group, the number of patients positive for porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) decreased from 7 to 2 after therapy. in the test group, the 4 patients positive for pg at baseline remained positive after therapy. in both groups, all subjects were positive for prevotella intermedia (pi) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) at baseline. at 12 months, all subjects had detectable subgingival fn. 9 out of the 11 placebo and 8 of the 10 test patients  remained positive for pi. there were no differences in detection frequency of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and bacteroides forsythus (bf) in both groups between baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. the findings demonstrated that, in comparison to placebo, systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid provided no additional clinical and microbiological effects in the treatment of adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == a 15-month evaluation of the effects of repeated subgingival minocycline in chronic adult periodontitis.
AB  == background: a double-blind, randomized, parallel, comparative study was designed  to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of subgingivally administered minocycline ointment versus a vehicle control. methods: one hundred four patients (104) with moderate to severe adult periodontitis (34 to 64 years of age; mean 46 years) were enrolled in the study. following scaling and root planing, patients were randomized to receive either 2% minocycline ointment or a matched vehicle control. study medication was administered directly into the periodontal pocket with a specially designed, graduated, disposable applicator at baseline; week 2;  and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. scaling and root planing was repeated at months 6 and 12. standard clinical variables (including probing depth and attachment level) were evaluated at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. microbiological sampling using dna probes was done at baseline; at week 2; and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. results: both treatment groups showed significant  and clinically relevant reductions in the numbers of each of the 7 microorganisms measured during the entire 15-month study period. when differences were detected, sites treated with minocycline ointment always produced statistically significantly greater reductions than sites which received the vehicle control. for initial pockets > or =5 mm, a mean reduction in probing depth of 1.9 mm was seen in the test sites, versus 1.2 mm in the control sites. sites with a baseline probing depth > or =7 mm and bleeding index >2 showed an average of 2.5 mm reduction with minocycline versus 1.5 mm with the vehicle. gains in attachment (0.9 mm and 1.1 mm) were observed in minocycline-treated sites, with baseline probing depth > or =5 mm and > or =7 mm, respectively, compared with 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm gain at control sites. subgingival administration of minocycline ointment  was well tolerated. conclusions: overall, the results demonstrate that repeated subgingival administration of minocycline ointment in the treatment of adult periodontitis is safe and leads to significant adjunctive improvement after subgingival instrumentation in both clinical and microbiologic variables over a 15-month period.

TI  == one stage full- versus partial-mouth disinfection in the treatment of chronic adult or generalized early-onset periodontitis. ii. long-term impact on microbial load.
AB  == background: recent studies showed the clinical benefits of a one stage full-mouth disinfection, when compared to the worldwide standard treatment strategy of consecutive root planings per quadrant without proper disinfection of the remaining intraoral niches. the purpose of this study was to investigate the microbiological benefits of such a one stage full-mouth disinfection with special attention to all intraoral niches for periodontopathogens and to evaluate the perception by the patients of the new treatment strategy. methods: sixteen patients with early-onset periodontitis and 24 patients with severe adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test and control groups. the control group was scaled and root planed, per quadrant, at 2-week intervals and given oral hygiene instructions. the test group received the one stage full-mouth disinfection treatment. at baseline and after 1, 2, 4, and 8 months, microbiological samples were taken from all niches (tongue, mucosa, saliva, and pooled samples from single- and multi-rooted teeth). the samples were cultured on selective and non-selective media. patient perception of the treatment was evaluated using a questionnaire. results: in comparison to the standard therapy,  the one stage full-mouth disinfection resulted in significant additional microbial improvements. the test group showed larger reductions in the proportions of spirochetes and motile organisms in the subgingival flora, and more significant reductions in the density of key pathogens, with even the eradication of p. gingivalis. the beneficial effects in the other niches were primarily restricted to the number of colony-forming units/ml of black-pigmented  bacteria, especially on the mucosa and in the saliva and to a lesser extent on the tongue. both treatments were well tolerated by the patients and the overall severity rating for both therapies was comparable, although 4 quadrants were treated within 24 hours in the test group versus only 1 in the control group. the full-mouth disinfection approach resulted more frequently in a slight increase of body temperature, especially after the second day. conclusions: these findings support the benefit of a one stage full-mouth disinfection in the treatment of patients with either chronic adult or early-onset periodontitis.

TI  == effect of initial periodontal therapy on the frequency of detecting bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans have been described as periodontopathic bacteria, and their presence in subgingival pockets can lead to development of periodontal disease. until now, clinical parameters have been used to evaluate the effect of conventional periodontal treatment without microbiological parameters. the present study examined the microbiological effects of initial periodontal therapy using dna probes and the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-six patients with periodontitis, 10 males and 16 females, were given instructions regarding oral hygiene, then thoroughly treated by conventional scaling and root  planing. bacterial samples were collected on paper points from 4 sites per patient at baseline and after initial therapy (total: 104 sites). clinical parameters including probing depth, attachment level, and bleeding on probing were also recorded for each site at baseline and after therapy. a dna probe kit was used to monitor the frequency of b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, the last of which was identified by pcr. results: at baseline, b. forsythus was the bacterium most frequently detected. dna probe analysis also showed that more than half of the sites were colonized by both b. forsythus and p. gingivalis. initial therapy resulted in significant clinical improvement such as significant reduction in the frequency of b. forsythus and p. gingivalis detected using the dna probe. a. actinomycetemcomitans was difficult to detect using the dna probe, but pcr indicated that levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans did not significantly decrease. conclusions: these results  indicate that initial conventional therapy can eliminate b. forsythus and p. gingivalis, but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. when levels of these bacteria decreased to below-detectable levels, clinical improvement was significant. these results indicate that monitoring levels of these three periodontopathic bacteria  may render periodontal therapy more effective and accurate.

TI  == relationship between herpesviruses and adult periodontitis and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background: various mammalian viruses and specific bacteria seem to play important roles in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis. this study examined the relationship between subgingival herpesviruses and periodontal disease and potential periodontopathic bacteria in 140 adults exhibiting either periodontitis or gingivitis. methods: a nested-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method determined the presence of epstein-barr virus type 1 and type 2 (ebv-1, ebv-2), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), and herpes simplex virus (hsv) and a 16s rrna pcr detection method identified actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and treponema denticola. results: using a logistic analysis, ebv-1 showed significant positive association with p. gingivalis (odds ratio [or] 3.37), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia (or 4.03); p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 3.84); p. gingivalis and t. denticola (or 4.17); p. gingivalis,  b. forsythus, and t. denticola (or 4.06); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 3.29). ebv-1 also showed positive association with severe periodontitis (or 5.09), with increasing age (or 1.03), and with periodontal probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.77). hcmv was positively associated with  coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t.  denticola (or 2.59); with severe periodontitis (or 4.65); and with age (or 1.03). patients with mixed viral infections revealed significant associations with p. gingivalis (or 2.27), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 2.06); p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 2.70) with the clinical diagnosis of slight (or 3.73), moderate (or 3.82), or severe periodontitis (or 4.36), and with probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.39). hsv and ebv-2 showed no significant associations with any of the variables tested. conclusions: the results indicate that subgingival ebv-1, hcmv, and viral coinfections are associated with the subgingival presence of some periodontal pathogens and periodontitis. herpesviruses may exert periodontopathic potential by decreasing the host resistance against subgingival colonization and multiplication of periodontal pathogens.

AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == changes of periodontal status in patients with down syndrome during a 7-year period.
AB  == the development of periodontal disease in down syndrome adolescents (n = 34) was  studied clinically and on intraoral radiographs during a 7-yr period. the occurrence of gingival inflammation (gbi), pathological periodontal pockets (>4 mm), sub- and supragingival calculus, alveolar bone height, alveolar bone loss, and the occurrence of the periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga, and porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque were determined. of the subjects, 41% had one or more pathological periodontal pockets at baseline compared to 65% at follow-up. at the baseline examination, 35% of the individuals exhibited alveolar bone loss compared to 74% at the follow-up. the median value of sites with alveolar bone loss increased from 0 to 1, the new lesions mainly being located in the incisor region. the estimated annual reduction of alveolar bone height in each subject was 0.04 mm on average. the occurrence of the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga, and p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque did not differ between baseline and follow-up. the results of the present study indicate that the frequency of periodontitis, mainly located on the lower incisors, markedly increased during a 7-yr period in down syndrome individuals, although the severity and progression was limited compared to what has previously been described.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in adult twins.
AB  == background: both environmental and genetic factors are known to influence clinical measures of periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic factors similarly influence the presence of specific periodontal bacteria in subgingival plaque. methods: reared-together and reared-apart monozygous (mz) and dizygous (dz) adult twins were examined clinically. demographic and behavioral information was obtained from each subject by questionnaire. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the index teeth,  and the presence of p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum was determined using an immunoassay. results: microbiological and clinical data were available for 169 twin pairs. the subject-based prevalences of the bacteria in the twin groups ranged from 11% for  porphyromonas gingivalis to 40% for f. nucleatum. for all species examined, the concordance rates were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between mz and dz twin groups. these findings were apparent despite similar smoking histories, self-reported oral hygiene practices, and antibiotic use in the twin groups. furthermore, mz twins reared together were not more similar than mz reared-apart  twins with respect to any bacterial species examined. conclusions: these findings suggest that in a population with access to routine dental care, any effects that host genes and the early family environment have on the presence of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque are not apparent in adulthood. most twins with disease in this study had early periodontitis. results from this study may not necessarily be extrapolated to more advanced disease states.

TI  == induction of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == we examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte autoantibody (ata) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral escherichia coli. all of the lps induced igm-ata. among these, lps from  c. ochracea induced the highest level of igm-ata, whereas that of p. gingivalis induced the lowest. the peritoneal t lymphocytes of mice injected with lps were bound by igm-ata. peritoneal b-1 (cd5+b) cells stimulated by each lps produced much more igm-ata than splenic b-2 (cd5-b) cells, suggesting that b-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. serum of mice injected with c. ochracea and f. nucleatum lps showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by igm purified from serum of the mice injected with c. ochracea lps. furthermore, serum of mice treated with c. ochracea, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans  lps inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. however, purified igm from the serum of mice treated with c. ochracea lps failed to produce the same inhibition. our results suggest that lps from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce igm-ata in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.

TI  == the microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the presence or absence of actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in young chinese adults and to examine the a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates from positive subjects with regard  to the serotype distribution, presence of the leukotoxin gene lkta and the promoter for the leukotoxin operon as well as the incidence of phage aa phi 23. sixty subjects, working in a knitting factory in the province of guangzhou, people's republic of china, were investigated. subgingival microbial samples were taken from both upper first molars. they were cultured both anaerobically and in  5% co2. p. gingivalis was found in 33 subjects. on average, it constituted 7% of  the total anaerobic cultivable counts. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 37 subjects of which seven yielded counts > 10(5). twenty-one subjects were positive for both organisms. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a was found in 9 subjects, serotype c was found in 23 and serotype e in 5. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes b and d were not detected in any subjects. presence of the leukotoxin gene lkta was demonstrated for all a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates; however, none of the a. actinomycetemcomitans strains from the present study had a deletion in the promoter region of the leukotoxin operon. the results of this investigation show a high frequency of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans and corroborate the concept that there is variation in virulence and pathogenic potential among isolates from different subjects.

TI  == the importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  == cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization  of various oral bacterial species. bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an  important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. the properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance.  among others, porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. the fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kda fimbrillin proteins. dna sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fima) from nine strains of p. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fima, while retaining common  immunochemical specificities. p. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is  known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. fimbriae of prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. these fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface  and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.

TI  == relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). methods: thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. within each subject, the ast contents of gcf from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. ast-positive site refers to one that had an ast level > or = 800 microiu. subgingival plaque samples from one ast-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. one site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. culture and immunofluorescence (if) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and porphyromonas gingivalis. logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the ast test and certain specific pathogens. results: the gcf scores and  total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in ast-positive sites than either ast-negative or healthy sites. the prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as c rectus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, p. intermedia, and p. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. in analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the ast test by logistic regression, only p. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. the odds ratio of having a  high proportion of p. gingivalis in the presence of a positive ast test was 1.21. conclusions: the present study showed that at ast-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. although only the correlation of p. gingivalis and ast values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of ast levels in gcf.

TI  == some effects of periodontal therapy on local and systemic immunological parameters.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on some local (gingival) and systemic host defense characteristics in subjects with advanced periodontal disease. 16 individuals with advanced periodontal disease were recruited. following a clinical examination, the 3 deepest interproximal sites in the upper and lower premolar- or molar segments were selected for further analysis. samples from the subgingival microbiota were obtained from the pocket of the selected sites and were prepared for a microbiological examination. the gingival tissue at one of the selected sites was also biopsied. each excised soft tissue specimen was snap  frozen and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis. a sample of peripheral blood was obtained from each individual and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis. following the baseline examination, all 16 patients received periodontal therapy including oral hygiene instruction and scaling and root planing. re-examinations regarding the clinical parameters were performed, the subgingival microbiota harvested from the sampling sites and one gingival biopsy  was collected at 12 months and 24 months, respectively, among the selected sites. samples of peripheral blood were obtained from the subjects at the 24-month re-examination. it was demonstrated that non-surgical periodontal therapy effectively reduced symptoms such as gingivitis and probing pocket depth in the subject sample and improved the overall probing attachment level. the treatment applied also markedly reduced (i) the total number of micro-organisms present in  selected gingival pockets as well as (ii) the relative proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia of the subgingival microbiota. the improved clinical condition was, in addition, accompanied by a substantial reduction in the size of the inflammatory lesion (p-ict) which in the soft tissue samples harvested at baseline was found to reside lateral to the pocket epithelium. also qualitative alterations occurred in the lesions. hence, following therapy (i) both the density of cd19 positive cells and the proportion  of cd3 positive cells expressing tcr vbeta genes were reduced in the p-ict. while (ii) the overall relative number of cd3 positive cells remained unchanged. in conclusion, non-surgical periodontal therapy markedly changed the size and composition of the plaque associated lesion in the gingival tissue but apparently failed to affect the relative distribution of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood.

TI  == inflammatory cytokine production and specific antibody responses against possible causative bacteria in patients with multilesional periapical periodontitis.
AB  == we examined the induction of inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) by several species of possible causative bacteria in periapical periodontitis. assays were done on human whole blood cultures from patients with differing numbers of periapical lesions; those having radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high lesion group), in one or two teeth (low lesion group), and healthy volunteers having no periapical lesions (no lesion group). prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845 induced interleukin-6 more strongly in subjects from the high lesion group than in the other groups. to ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the six subjects to different bacterial species. porphylomonas gingivalis cells reacted strongly with sera from the high lesion group. thus, prevotella melaninogenica and porphylomonas gingivalis may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing specific cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.

TI  == the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus in humans 1 year after 4 randomized treatment modalities.
AB  == the relationship between probing attachment changes in treated periodontal pockets and the prevalence of selected periodontal pathogens was assessed in 10 patients with adult periodontitis 1 year following randomized therapy. all patients had at least 1 tooth in each quadrant with an inflamed pocket of probing depth > or =5 mm and clinical attachment loss and harbored at least one of the following 3 major periodontal pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, or bacteroides forsythus. the number of target organisms per site was determined preoperatively; at 1 week; and at 1, 3, 6, and  12 months postoperatively utilizing dna probes. the following clinical parameters were measured and recorded preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment: gingival fluid flow, gingival index, plaque index, probing depth, probing attachment level, gingival recession, and bleeding on probing. one quadrant in each patient was randomly assigned to 1 of the following 4 treatments: 1) scaling and root planing; 2) pocket reduction through osseous surgery and apically-positioned flap; 3) modified widman flap; and 4) modified widman flap and topical application of saturated citric acid at ph 1 for 3 minutes. all 4 treatments were rendered in one appointment using local anesthesia. no postoperative antibiotics were used, but patients rinsed with 0.12% chlorhexidine for the first 3 months postoperatively and received a prophylaxis every 3 months. this investigation revealed: 1) 30.0% of the sites were infected by at least 1 species at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. 2) failing sites were infected by a high number of both pg and bf these sites had a  mean of 24.2+/-9.0 x 10(3) pg and 93.1+/-42.0 x 10(3) bf while stable sites had a mean of 6.8+/-0.5 x 10(3) pg and 7.2+/-1.2 x 10(3) bf (p = 0.06 and p = 0.05, respectively). 3) the infected sites lost significantly more mean clinical attachment at 12 months (1.5+/-0.5 mm compared to a loss of 0.2+/-0.3 mm for uninfected sites, p = 0.017). 4) the infected sites had a significantly greater bop (67+/-14% versus 25+/-8% for uninfected sites at 12 months, p = 0.012). 5) the choice of treatment modality did not affect the prevalence of the target species at 1 year post-treatment. these results suggest that prevalence of microbial pathogens negatively affects the 1 year outcome of periodontal surgical and nonsurgical therapy.

TI  == neutrophil response and microbiological findings around teeth and dental implants.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the neutrophil response, measured as both functional and antigenic elastase, around teeth and titanium implants and to relate these findings to the microbiota. the 31 patients included in the study had been treated successfully for total or partial edentulism with titanium implants. crevicular fluid and microbiological samples were taken from 3 sites: 1) crevices around teeth and 2) implants in 16 partially edentulous patients and  3) crevices around implants in 15 edentulous patients. all sites sampled showed similar degrees of inflammation assessed by gingival index and total protein concentration. the samples were analyzed for elastase activity and immunoreactive elastase. the elastase activity was significantly higher in crevices surrounding  implants in partially edentulous patients compared with implants in edentulous patients. the antigenic elastase showed no difference among the 3 sites. gram-positive cocci were the main bacterial species in all 3 groups. edentulous patients tended to have lower frequency of black pigmenting anaerobes. no correlation of analyzed bacteria and elastase activity was found between the 3 sites. this study indicates that, despite a similar appearance of clinical parameters and absence of significant differences in the microbiota, the inflammation around implants in partially edentulous patients induces a stronger  neutrophil response than does the inflammation around implants in edentulous patients.

TI  == periodontitis-associated marker bacteria in an urban north american patient population: application of a commercial immunoassay.
AB  == we used an immunoassay to demonstrate marker organisms (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in 3 private practice populations (f-me periodontist, 55 patients; mhm periodontist, 179 patients; and ewm general dentist, 19 patients). occurrence of the marker organisms involves the whole oral environment, not just individual sites, as shown by close correlation between presence of the marker organisms in 2 independent sites/samples within a single mouth. presence of the marker p. gingivalis (and p. intermedia) relates closely to periodontal pocketing while presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans does not have this pocket-associated characteristic. there was no significant relationship between presence of the marker organisms and the number of teeth in a mouth, and in the periodontal practice patients there was no significant effect of gender on occurrence of the  marker organisms. a. actinomycetemcomitans and the other 2 markers were found over the entire age range (12 to 75) of our patients. regular periodontal treatment reduced occurrence of all marker organisms and increased the frequency  of marker-negative patients and sites. occurrence of the marker organisms above immunoassay threshold levels appears to represent how receptive a patient is to each individual organism. most patients appear receptive to the presence of p. intermedia whether treated or not. significantly fewer patients who underwent regular treatment show the presence of p. gingivalis or a. actinomycetemcomitans  when compared to untreated patients. diagnostic application of microbial markers  requires ongoing clinical assessment of patients and careful clinical judgment. 1391.

TI  == diagnostic utility of specific microbiological markers for periodontal diseases.
AB  == specific detection of marker organisms porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans with an immunoassay provided 2 types of useful information directly into private clinical practice: 1) persistence of p. gingivalis in patients undergoing regular treatment allowed rapid identification of pockets requiring further treatment without waiting for measurable progression of lesions and 2) presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in  adults at any stage of diagnosis or treatment identified patients who may prove to have difficult-to-manage periodontitis. we made these findings in 253 patients (234 in specialist periodontal practices [f-me 55; mhm 179] and 19 in general dental practice [ewm]). the search for useful diagnostic markers overlaps only partly with the search for periodontal pathogens. the p. gingivalis marker and the a. actinomycetemcomitans marker identify 2 different patterns of infection that appear to reflect 2 different underlying problems. demonstration of pocket-dependent infection with p. gingivalis in treated patients provides an outcome marker for sites not converting to marker-negative sites at detection levels of the immunoassay. this information facilitates selection of sites and patients requiring adjustment of treatment regimens. detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans in adult patients is significantly associated with periodontitis characterized as refractory. positive identification of a. actinomycetemcomitans with the immunoassay supports clinical decision-making by drawing attention to adult patients who require closer monitoring and intensive persistent treatment. successful application of immunoassay detection of microbiological markers is based on continuous patient monitoring to support clinical decisions; it does not replace careful clinical judgment.

TI  == microbiological features and crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity in early onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and the specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. aspartate aminotransferase enzyme (ast) is one of the components of gcf that is released as a result of cell death. in this study, periodontal sites (4 sites/patient) with a probing depth of > or =5 mm in early onset periodontitis (eop) patients were first examined for the ast levels in gcf by the periogard periodontal tissue monitor. to be eligible for the study, each of the patients had at least 1 ast positive site with clinical inflammatory changes (ast+, cic+)  and 1 ast negative site with no or minimum clinical inflammatory changes (ast-, cic-). in 15 eop patients who met the entry criteria, 30 ast+, cic+ sites (1st group) and 19 ast-, cic- sites (2nd group) were evaluated for microbiological variables. certain microbial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected more frequently (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) in the 1st group, while gram-positive facultative organisms such as actinomyces species were found more often (p<0.001) in the 2nd group. parallel to the ast levels, the 2nd group had a lower number of total bacteria and proportion of obligate anaerobic and capnophilic micro-organisms than the first group (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). within the scope of this study, ast activity and microbiological data were found in agreement in the examined groups. these findings are encouraging and indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the ability of  the ast test to differentiate the microbial flora of progressing sites and those  that are inflamed, but not progressing.

AB  == serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a turkish population. additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar us patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. serum from 89 (ljp), 86 (rpp) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (elisa) to determine igg antibody to  14 oral micro-organisms. all ljp patients from turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and jp2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in us ljp patients. 50% of the turkish rpp patients also showed elevated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the us rpp patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. healthy subjects and ljp and  rpp patients from the us exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 p. gingivalis  serogroups compared to those from turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the p. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in ljp and rpp  patients from turkey than from the us. interestingly, 87% and 77% of the ljp patients in the turkish population had elevated antibody responses to p. gingivalis and e. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the us ljp patients. these data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. this supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.

AB  == little is known regarding the molecules expressed by gingival epithelial cells that are involved in initiating and maintaining inflammation following the interaction with periodontal pathogens. thus, we investigated the effect of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis infection on the expression of neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin 8 (il-8) and the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by gingival epithelial cells. the data revealed that both il-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression increased after infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans (il-8: 2- to 7-fold; intercellular adhesion molecule-1: 2.5- to 3.7-fold). il-8 secretion reached a maximal level 6 h after the infection and the expression subsequently decreased to basal level. the increased cell surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression started at 4 h after infection and reached a maximal level 14 h after  the infection. in contrast, the expression of both molecules rapidly decreased 2  h after challenge with p. gingivalis. this opposite influence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis infection on the expression of il-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by gingival epithelial cells suggests that a. actinomycetemcomitans infection may initiate the recruitment of neutrophils, whereas the p. gingivalis infection may retard this process and therefore demonstrate a distinct perspective of virulence.

TI  == local metronidazole application in maintenance patients. clinical and microbiological evaluation.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effect of local antibiotic therapy in comparison with subgingival scaling and root planing in a randomized semi-masked study. forty-six recall patients who completed systematic periodontal therapy 6 to 24 months prior to the study were enrolled. the inclusion requirements were at least one site with probing depth > or = 5 mm in each quadrant, no scaling, and no antibiotic therapy during the last 6 months. after randomization each patient received 2 different treatments: in 2 quadrants metronidazole 25% dental gel was applied subgingivally to the pockets at day 0 and day 7; scaling and root planing was carried out in the 2 other quadrants, one at day 0 and in the remaining quadrant at day 7. subgingival microbiological samples were taken from each patient before treatment and on days 21, 91, and 175 after the treatment. the analyses were carried out by indirect immunofluorescence assay. at all treated sites probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded on days 0, 21, 91, and 175. both treatments resulted in pd reduction and cal gain. pd reduction was statistically significant (p < 0.01) for both treatment modalities after 6 months. the cal gain was not significant for either treatment. there was no statistical significance between scaling and antibiotic therapy. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced after therapy; however, there were no statistically significant differences between treatments. if actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was present before therapy, it was also present after treatment in both groups. the conclusion is that, in recall patients, local application of metronidazole and scaling and root planing showed similar clinical and microbiological effects without statistically significant differences.

TI  == risk indicators for harboring periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the risk for harboring 6 putative periodontal pathogens in 4 selected periodontal pockets, in whole saliva, or in either site (i.e., orally) was determined in 52 caucasians, 49 african-americans, 48 asian-americans, and 50 hispanics living in  los angeles. 16s rrna pcr analysis assessed the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. step-wise  regression analysis determined the relationship between the occurrence of each organism and various explanatory variables (risk indicators). periodontal probing depth or disease severity was positively associated with all 6 study organisms. african-americans carried an increased risk for harboring p. gingivalis in saliva (odds ratio [or] 2.95) and orally (or 2.66), and a reduced risk for harboring t.  denticola orally (or 0.34). asian-americans showed an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 6.63) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 5.39), in saliva (or 5.74), and orally (or  5.81). hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 12.27) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 6.07), in saliva (or 8.72), and orally (or 7.98). age was positively associated with the prevalence of p. gingivalis in saliva (or 1.20) and orally (or 1.20), and of a. actinomycetemcomitans orally (or 1.18). the male  gender was a risk factor for harboring p. intermedia in periodontal pockets (or 2.40), in saliva (or 3.31), and orally (or 4.25), and for harboring p. nigrescens in saliva (or 2.85). the longer the subjects resided in the united states, the less likely a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected orally (or 0.82). former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (or 0.23). current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring t. denticola in periodontal pockets (or 4.61). the number of dental visits in the past 10 years was inversely related to the prevalence of p. intermedia orally (or 0.96). the prevalence of p. intermedia in saliva was positively associated with the length of time from the last dental visit (or 1.01). this study suggests that genetic and/or environmental factors predispose subjects to oral colonization by  putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == clinical expression of tnf-alpha in smoking-associated periodontal disease.
AB  == the level of tnf-alpha in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) was analyzed with respect to smoking in patients with untreated moderate to severe periodontal disease including 30 current smokers, 19 former smokers and 29 non-smokers, in the age range 31-79 years. concomitantly the occurrence of the periopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and prevotella intermedia (pi) and the gcf levels of albumin, iga and igg were analyzed. with regard to clinical characteristics, there were no statistically significant differences between smoking groups. the occurrence of patients positive for the periopathogens aa, pg and pi was 28.2%, 41.0% and 91.0%, respectively. there were no statistically significant differences between smoking groups with regard to occurrence or relative frequency of these periopathogens. an exception was a significantly lower occurrence of aa in former smokers as compared to non-smokers. the chief novelty of the study was the observation of a  clearly increased level of tnf-alpha in gcf associated with smoking. both current and former smokers exhibited significantly higher levels of tnf-alpha in comparison to non-smokers, whereas the levels of albumin, iga and igg were the same irrespective of smoking. in conclusion, the present observations in patients with moderate to severe periodontal disease suggest that smoking is associated with elevated gcf levels of the cytokine tnf-alpha.

TI  == identification of bacterial markers by culture technique in evaluation of periodontal therapy.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia, as revealed by culture technique, could discriminate between three distinct adult patient groups, those: with recurrent periodontal disease, with cured periodontal disease or who were periodontally healthy. forty one patients previously treated for advanced periodontitis were divided into recurrent or cured groups, with a third periodontally healthy reference group. all subjects were sampled for the three bacterial strains under scrutiny. although all three micro-organisms were found significantly more often in diseased sites, it was concluded that a sample positive for all three may indicate a false record of disease activity. however,  a sample negative for the three bacteria strongly indicates an absence of disease activity.

TI  == periodontal findings in elderly patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
AB  == the periodontal status of 25 patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) (age range 58 to 76) was investigated and compared with 40 non-diabetic control subjects (age range 59 to 77). surfaces with visible plaque  and bleeding after probing, calculus, recessions, and pathological pockets were examined. the total attachment loss was calculated as a sum of recessions and pockets in millimeters. mesial and distal bone loss was measured from panoramic radiographs and mean alveolar bone loss was calculated. periodontal disease was considered advanced when mean alveolar bone loss was over 50%, or 2 or more teeth had pockets > or = 6 mm. microbiological analysis comprised the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. patients with niddm had significantly more often advanced periodontitis than control subjects, 40.0% and  12.5%, respectively. diabetic patients did not harbor more pathogens than the control subjects. the hba1c level deteriorated in patients with advanced periodontitis, but not in other patients with niddm, when compared to the situation 2 to 3 years earlier. advanced periodontitis seems to be associated with the impairment of the metabolic control in patients with niddm, and a regular periodontal surveillance is therefore necessary.

TI  == subgingival microflora and treatment in prepubertal periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia.
AB  == prepubertal periodontitis affects both primary and permanent dentition. the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival microflora of the permanent dentition in an 11-year-old caucasian female, who had premature exfoliation of her deciduous teeth on her 5th year of age, and the response of this condition to the antibiotic therapy and supportive periodontal care. gingival tissues were highly inflamed and alveolar bone loss was detected radiographically. the girl had experienced frequent upper respiratory tract infections, tonsilitis and recurrent otitis media. her mother had history of early onset periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia. blood chemistry tests and immunological examinations were also performed. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the proximal sites of permanent molars, incisors, canines and maxillary premolars. 27 different microbial species were isolated from the subgingival microflora. among the predominant species were porphyromonas gingivalis (17.6%-7.3%), prevotella intermedia (12.4%-4.7%), capnocytophaga sputigena (14.4%-10.4%), capnocytophaga ochracea (13.2%-6.9%) and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.3%-5.5%). periodontal treatment consisted of scaling, root planing in conjunction with antibiotic administration of augmentin 312.5 mg and flagyl 200 mg, each t.i.d. for 10 days. 3 weeks after the  antibiotic therapy, bacterial samples were collected from the same sites. all the periodontal pathogens were recovered in lower levels and a.actinomycetemcomitans  was almost eliminated in the 3-week period. the evaluation of clinical indices at 3, 6 and 12 months showed that periodontal treatment in conjunction with antibiotics was effective and rapidly followed by marked clinical improvement. the microbiological monitoring at 3, 6 and 12 months after antibiotic treatment and each time prior to supportive periodontal care, revealed that the periodontal pathogens fluctuated in low levels even 12 months after treatment and could be maintained at low level by supportive periodontal care at 3-month intervals.

TI  == cytokine production by cryopreserved human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in  response to periodontal pathogens.
AB  == freezing techniques provide a way of repeating and extending immunological assays by using frozen portions of an individual's peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction. earlier work shows that the lymphocytes that are stored frozen retain their ability to respond to polyclonal b-cell activators, mitogens, superantigens and bacterial extracts of oral interest. these studies extend previous findings by determining cytokine production by lymphocytes following frozen storage for up to 24 weeks. production of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-2, il-6, and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-beta by stimulated lymphocytes after cyropreservation was not significantly different from those responses before storage, with one exception: il-6 production was negligible after 24 weeks' frozen storage when thawed cells were cocultured with pokeweed mitogen. after stimulation with extracts from porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  the proliferative capacity of the frozen cells was maintained as well as the production of il-1beta, il-2, and il-6. tnf-beta was not produced in response to  bacterial antigen stimulation. the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  to retain functional activity after frozen storage should permit more effective monitoring during longitudinal clinical studies and a better evaluation of changes in cytokine production in patients with advanced periodontitis both during and after treatment.

AB  == the keyes technique came to national attention following a reference in the new york times in the late 1970s. several lay press articles and discussions on national television served to further focus the interest of patients, general dentists, and periodontists on this potential approach to periodontal therapy. early evaluations of the data on the technique resulted in an academy position paper in 1981. recognizing that there was a lack of well-controlled studies on the technique led to extensive research efforts supported by the national institute of dental research. the results of those efforts have provided substantial new information that serves as the basis of the present position paper. although this technique is no longer widely used in the united states, some patients and dentists may have not had the benefit of the new data.

TI  == potential pathogenic mechanisms of periodontitis associated pregnancy complications.
AB  == during normal pregnancy, maternal hormones and locally acting cytokines play a key role in regulating the onset of labor, cervical ripening, uterine contraction, and delivery. maternal infections during pregnancy have been demonstrated to perturb this normal cytokine and hormone-regulated gestation, sometimes resulting in preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and preterm low birth weight (plbw), i.e., < 2,500 g and < 37 weeks of gestation. our research focus has been to determine whether periodontal infections can provide sufficient challenge to the mother to trigger plbw. new experiments from 48 case-control subjects have measured gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) levels of pge(2) and il-1-beta to determine whether mediator levels were related to current pregnancy outcome. in addition, the levels of 4 periodontal pathogens were measured by using microbe-specific dna probes. results indicate that gcf-pge(2) levels are significantly higher in plbw mothers, as compared with normal birth weight (nbw) controls (131.4 +/- 21.8 vs. 62.6 +/- 10.3 [mean +/- se ng/ml], respectively, at p = 0.02). furthermore, within primiparous plbw mothers, there was a significant inverse association between birth weight (as well as gestational age) and gcf-pge(2) levels at p = 0.023. these data suggest a dose-response relationship for increasing gcf-pge(2) as a marker of current periodontal disease activity and decreasing birth weight. microbial data indicate that 4 organisms associated with mature plaque and progressing periodontitis--bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and treponema denticola--were detected at higher levels in plbw mothers, as compared to nbw controls. these data suggest that biochemical measures of maternal periodontal status and oral microbial burden are associated  with current plbw.

TI  == oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == the utility of whole saliva to detect the oral presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study compared the presence of 6 periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and subgingival plaque of 202 subjects. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition. the kappa test revealed a fair agreement between the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples (kappa > 0.4). the mcnemar test showed that the differences between sample types were due to a more frequent detection of the 3 organisms in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01). prevotella nigrescens also was detected more frequently in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01; mcnemar  test). although little agreement between samples was found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus (kappa < or = 0.4), neither whole saliva nor pocket samples showed better detection for these 2 species (p < 0.01,  mcnemar test). the results indicate that whole saliva is superior to pooled periodontal pocket samples to detect p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola in the oral cavity. the detection of oral a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus with reasonably good accuracy may require  both whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples.

AB  == the present study was performed to assess and compare the clinical healing and the microbiological findings following local application of metronidazole or tetracycline to augment subgingival scaling in previously untreated adult periodontitis sites. eighteen patients with moderate to severe adult periodontitis at single-rooted teeth were selected. in each patient, 3 interproximal sites having comparable root anatomy, probing depth > or =5 mm and  bleeding on probing were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1) two sessions of subgingival scaling and root planing; 2) similar to 1, with each treatment supplemented with a 25% metronidazole sustained release gel; 3) similar to 1 with each treatment supplemented with a 3% tetracycline ointment. the treatments were performed by 1 operator and the clinical variables probing depth, attachment level, and bleeding on probing were evaluated at baseline, 3 months and 6 months by a second blinded examiner. the microbiological findings were evaluated using a commercial test kit. the average probing depth reduction for the 3 groups at 6 months was 1.5 mm and the average gain of clinical attachment was 0.8 mm. there were no significant differences between the effects following topical application of the metronidazole gel or the tetracycline ointment. scaling and root planing alone appeared as effective as the drug augmented regimens, although there was a weak but non-significant tendency for better results in sites treated with the antibiotic drugs. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was generally not detected; prevotella intermedia was not significantly reduced, while porphyromonas gingivalis was significantly reduced in all treatment groups. it was concluded that the augmentative effect of the metronidazole gel and the tetracycline ointment was comparable but small compared to scaling and root planing alone. the clinical importance of such small augmentation effects should be further evaluated.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == the effect of supragingival plaque control on the progression of advanced periodontal disease.
AB  == the aim of the present trial was to study the effect of meticulous supragingival  plaque control on (i) the subgingival microbiota, and (ii) the rate of progression of attachment loss in subjects with advanced periodontal disease. an  intra-individual group of sites exposed to non-surgical periodontal therapy served as controls. 12 patients with advanced periodontal disease were subjected  to a baseline examination (bl) including assessments of oral hygiene status, gingival condition (bop), probing depth, clinical attachment level and subgingival microbiota from pooled samples from each quadrant. the assessments were repeated after 12, 24 and 36 months. following bl, a split mouth study was initiated. the patients received oral hygiene instruction, supragingival scaling  and case presentation. 2 quadrants in each patient were identified as "test" and  the remaining 2 as "control" quadrants. subgingival therapy was performed in all  bleeding sites in the control quadrants. oral hygiene instructions and plaque control exercises were repeated once every 2 weeks during the initial 3 months of the study. thereafter the plaque control program was repeated once every 3 months for the duration of the 3 years. sites demonstrating loss of clinical attachment  > or =2 mm in the test quadrants were treated subgingivally. the results showed that in both test and control quadrants repeated oral hygiene instructions and supragingival plaque removal procedures resulted in low plaque scores throughout  the study. the gingival bleeding scores and the frequency of periodontal pockets  > or =4 mm was, however, significantly higher in the test quadrants than in the control quadrants. at the end of the 3 year study, the control quadrants showed significantly more reduced (> or =2 mm) pockets than the test quadrants, 265 versus 96. the number of sites in the test quadrants showing probing attachment loss > or =2 mm was more than 4x greater than in the control quadrants (59 versus 13). the microbiological findings indicate a more pronounced reduction only for p. gingivalis in the control quadrants. none of the other 4 marker bacteria consistently reflected or predicted the clinical parameters. the present study shows that only supragingival plaque control fails to prevent further periodontal tissue destruction in subjects with advanced periodontal disease.

TI  == interleukin-6 in neutrophils from peripheral blood and inflammatory periradicular tissues.
AB  == periradicular tissue samples were recovered from patients undergoing endodontic surgery. immunohistochemical procedures were used to identify interleukin-6 (il-6) present in the neutrophils associated with these lesions. using specific polyclonal antibody, 15 to 20% of the neutrophils associated with the periradicular tissue lesions were positive for il-6. il-6-positive plasma cells and histiocytes were also abundant. cytokine production by neutrophils from the peripheral blood of nondiseased individuals was also evaluated. the cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides and bacterial extracts of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. significant levels of il-6 were produced by cells stimulated with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide b5 (933 pg/ml/10(7) neutrophils) and e. coli lipopolysaccharide b12 (791 pg/ml/10(7) neutrophils) when compared with unstimulated cells (39.31 pg/ml/10(7) cells). there was a dose-dependent increase in il-6 production when cells were stimulated for 24 h with 6 and 12 micrograms/ml of a. actinomycetemcomitans extract. less stimulation occurred with p. gingivalis, but it was also dose-dependent. neutrophils resident in periradicular lesions may, therefore, provide a source of il-6 in addition to that produced by tissue histiocytes and plasma cells.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study is to examine the long-term effect of diode laser therapy on periodontal pockets with regard to its bactericidal abilities and the improvement of periodontal condition. study design/materials and methods: fifty patients were randomly subdivided into two groups (laser-group and control-group) and microbiologic samples were collected.  there have been six appointments for 6 months following an exact treatment scheme. after evaluating periodontal indices (bleeding on probing, quigley-hein)  including pocket depths and instruction of patients in oral hygiene and scaling therapy of all patients, the deepest pockets of each quadrant of the laser-group's patients were microbiologically examined. afterwards, all teeth were treated with the diode laser. the control-group received the same treatment  but instead of laser therapy were rinsed with h2o2. each appointment also included a hygienic check-up. after 6 months the final values of the periodontal  indices and further microbiologic samples were measured. the total bacterial count as well as specific bacteria, such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis, were assessed semiquantitatively. results: the bacterial reduction with diode laser therapy was significantly better than in the control group. the index of bleeding on probing  improved in 96.9% in the laser-group, whereas only 66.7% in the control group. pocket depths could be more reduced in the laser group than in the control group. conclusion: the diode laser reveals a bactericidal effect and helps to reduce inflammation in the periodontal pockets in addition to scaling. the diode laser therapy, in combination with scaling, supports healing of the periodontal pockets through eliminating bacteria.

TI  == serum igg antibody response to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis: implications for periodontal diagnosis.
AB  == the relationship of the serum antibody titer and avidity to the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) strains y4 and 29523 and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) strain 381 were examined in relation to clinical parameters in 26 gingivitis and 28 periodontitis patients. the relationship of antibody titer and avidity to infection with the homologous organism was also examined in a subset of 30 patients. antibody titer was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and antibody avidity was assessed using a dissociation assay. considering all patients, there was a significant negative correlation between mean probing depth and antibody titer (r=-0.28) and avidity (r=-0.28) to aa y4. there was a significant positive correlation of probing depth and antibody titer (r=0.46) and avidity (r=0.46) to  pg. the correlation of antibody titer and avidity to aa and infection with aa y4  (r=-0.32, r=-0.21) and aa 29523 (r=-0.35, r=-0.39) was negative, while the correlations of titer and avidity to pg and presence of the organisms was strongly positive (r=0.40, r=0.35). these data indicate that the relationship of  serum antibody titer and avidity to clinical parameters of periodontal disease severity and the level of infection with the homologous organism appears to be different for aa and pg. the development of an antibody response to aa appears to protect the individual from infection with the organism. in contrast, the development of an antibody response to pg was not able to eliminate the infection. these results should be considered when developing a diagnostic strategy for periodontal disease utilizing the humoral immune response.

TI  == severity of localized juvenile periodontitis as related to polymorphonuclear chemotaxis and specific microbial isolates.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to determine if an association exists  between severity of localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) and impairment of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) chemotaxis and/or colonization by specific microbial isolates; (b) to determine if the number of specific microbial isolates, i.e., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus correlates to clinical severity of sites with ljp. thirty-six first molars in nine subjects with ljp were examined. a clinical severity score was computed based on attachment level and vertical bone loss. the mean score of the four sites was designated as the clinical severity score for each subject. a dna probe was used to quantitate colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, e. corrodens,  and c. rectus. the chemotaxis of isolated peripheral blood pmns was measured in boyden chambers using the leading front technique. it was found that the clinical severity score ranged from 7.8 for mild involvement to 32.5 for severe ljp. the chemotaxis result for each patient (micron/90 min) was expressed as a percentage  of the value for a paired healthy control and ranged from 40% to 104%. four of the nine subjects had chemotaxis values less than 70% of control. linear regression analysis showed: (a) no significant correlation between pmn chemotaxis and severity of ljp in subjects (r = .14); (b) a significant correlation (r = 0.43) between severe sites with ljp and number of specific microbial isolates. sites with severe ljp had present at least five different microbial isolates as compared with non-severe sites (p < .05). no particular trend of colonization by  periodontopathogens was seen in non-severe sites. further, severe sites of ljp displayed a statistically significant greater colonization by p. intermedia, e. corrodens, and c. rectus than did non-severe sites (p < .05). it may be concluded that neither the degree of pmn chemotactic impairment nor a. actinomycetemcomitans is a reliable indicator of the severity of ljp.

TI  == adhesion of periodontal bacteria to titanium, and titanium alloy powders.
AB  == in this study, the adhesion of radioactively labeled actinomyces viscosus (a. viscosus), actinobacillus actinomicetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) to titanium (ti) and ti-6-al-4v alloy (ti-alloy) coated with albumin or human saliva was investigated. all the tested bacteria displayed greater attachment to ti-alloy than to ti. p. gingivalis exhibited less adhesion  to ti and ti-alloy than did the other bacterial strains. adhesion of a. viscosus  and aa was greatly reduced when ti or ti-alloy were coated with albumin or saliva. p. gingivalis demonstrated a lesser reduction in adhesion to albumin or saliva-coated surfaces. the results show that oral bacteria have different adhesion affinities for ti and ti-alloy and that both albumin and human saliva reduce bacterial adhesion.

TI  == differential clinical treatment outcome after systemic metronidazole and amoxicillin in patients harboring actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and/or porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == 48 adult patients with untreated periodontitis harboring subgingival actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and/or porphyromonas gingivalis as assessed  by pcr were randomly assigned to receive full-mouth scaling alone (control) or scaling with systemic metronidazole plus amoxicillin and supragingival irrigation with chlorhexidine digluconate (test). in patients harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans intraorally at baseline, the adjunctive antimicrobial therapy resulted in a significantly higher incidence of probing attachment level  (pal) gain of 2 mm or more compared to scaling alone over 12 months (p<0.05). in  addition, suppression of a. actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque below detectable levels was associated with an increased incidence of pal gain. in contrast, patients initially harboring p. gingivalis but not a. actinomycetemcomitans in the oral cavity showed a significantly higher incidence  of pal loss following adjunctive antimicrobial therapy compared to scaling alone  (p<0.05). when the presence of pathogens at baseline was disregarded in the analysis, adjunctive antimicrobial therapy did not significantly enhance clinical treatment outcome. the results indicated that adults with untreated periodontitis harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans may benefit from the adjunctive antimicrobial  therapy for a minimum of 12 months, whereas, the regimen may adversely affect the clinical treatment outcome of patients harboring p. gingivalis but not a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == the use of metronidazole and amoxicillin in the treatment of advanced periodontal disease. a prospective, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == the present clinical trial was performed to study the effect of systemic administration of metronidazole and amoxicillin as an adjunct to mechanical therapy in patients with advanced periodontal disease. 16 individuals, 10 female  and 6 male, aged 35-58 years, with advanced periodontal disease were recruited. a baseline examination included assessment of clinical, radiographical, microbiological and histopathological characteristics of periodontal disease. the 16 patients were randomly distributed into 2 different samples of 8 subjects each. one sample of subjects received during the first 2 weeks of active periodontal therapy, antibiotics administered via the systemic route (metronidazole and amoxicillin). during the corresponding period, the 2nd sample  of subjects received a placebo drug (placebo sample). in each of the 16 patients, 2 quadrants (1 in the maxilla and 1 in the mandible) were exposed to non-surgical subgingival scaling and root planing. the contralateral quadrants were left without subgingival instrumentation. thus, 4 different treatment groups were formed; group 1: antibiotic therapy but no scaling, group 2: antibiotic therapy plus scaling, group 3: placebo therapy but no scaling, group 4: placebo therapy plus scaling. re-examinations regarding the clinical parameters were performed, samples of the subgingival microbiota harvested and 1 soft tissue biopsy from 1 scaled and 1 non-scaled quadrant obtained 2 months and 12 months after the completion of active therapy. the teeth included in groups 1 and 3 were following the 12-month examination exposed to non-surgical periodontal therapy, and subsequently exited from the study. groups 2 and 4 were also re-examined 24 months after baseline. the findings demonstrated that in patients with advanced periodontal disease, systemic administration of metronidazole plus amoxicillin resulted in (i) an improvement of the periodontal conditions, (ii) elimination/suppression of putative periodontal pathogens such as a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and (iii) reduction of the size of the inflammatory lesion. the antibiotic regimen alone, however, was less  effective than mechanical therapy with respect to reduction of bop - positive sites, probing pocket depth reduction, probing attachment gain. the combined mechanical and systemic antibiotic therapy (group 2) was more effective than mechanical therapy alone in terms of improvement of clinical and microbiological  features of periodontal disease.

TI  == periodontal status and serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms in sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. rapid bacterial plaque accumulation occurs in sjogren's syndrome patients due to decreases in salivary flow rate. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome  and evaluate serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including  major periodontopathogens, compared to healthy controls. seventeen sjogren's syndrome patients and 14 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque (pl), sulcular bleeding (sbi), periodontal index scores (pi), probing depths (pd), and total number of teeth were recorded. an elisa was used to determine the serum igg antibody level to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms. significantly higher pl, sbi, pd, and pi scores, as well as an increased number of lost teeth were observed in patients with sjogren's syndrome compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to streptococcus oralis were significantly lower in sjogren's syndrome patients than controls (p <0.0002). these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis compared to controls (p <0.006 to 0.0004). our findings indicate that sjogren's syndrome patients have established periodontal disease and serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms previously identified as periodontopathogens in systemically healthy subjects. these results suggest that sjogren's syndrome may affect bacterial colonization in plaque and contribute to increased periodontal disease in this compromised population.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of magnolol and honokiol against periodontopathic microorganisms.
AB  == magnolol (1) and honokiol (2), main compounds from the stem bark of magnolia obovata thunb., were evaluated for an antimicrobial activity against periodontopathic microorganisms, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga gingivalis, and veillonella  disper, and a cytotoxicity against human gingival fibroblasts and epithelial cells. our results indicate that magnolol and honokiol, although less potent than chlorhexidine, show a significant antimicrobial activity against these microorganisms, and a relatively low cytotoxic effect on human gingival cells. thus, it is suggested that magnolol and honokiol may have a potential therapeutic use as a safe oral antiseptic for the prevention and the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == microbial factors and gingival crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase levels. a cross-sectional study.
AB  == the aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the clinical application of chairside tests for gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels and plaque bana hydrolysis activity with the presence of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the study comprised 100 periodontitis sites (pocket depths > or =4 mm, gi=3) from 10 patients with chronic adult periodontitis and 100 control sites (pocket depths <4 mm, gi<3) from 10 periodontally healthy patients  comprising 55 healthy sites (pocket depths <4 mm, gi=0) and 45 gingivitis sites (pocket depths <4 mm, gi=1 or 2). the values for both bana hydrolysis and ast levels were significantly higher in samples from periodontitis compared with gingivitis and healthy sites (p<0.001). a. actinomycetemcomitans was identified in 45% and p. gingivalis in 17% of periodontitis sites but neither pathogen was recovered from control sites and there was no significant correlation with the clinical parameters measured. there was no significant relationship between the presence of p. gingivalis and/or a. actinomycetemcomitans with bana hydrolysis or ast levels. a significant correlation (p=0.0017) was observed between bana hydrolysis and pocket depth and between ast hydrolysis and the gi (p=0.01). this  study failed to demonstrate a positive association between chairside analysis of  gcf metabolites for ast levels and/or bana hydrolysis with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. however, the gcf metabolites had a significant correlation with periodontally diseased sites in patients with chronic adult periodontitis and may help confirm clinical observations.

TI  == untreated periodontal disease in indonesian adolescents. clinical and microbiological baseline data.
AB  == at present, several risk factors for the initiation and progression of periodontitis have been identified. in order to investigate the role of various potential clinical and microbiological risk factors and indicators, a longitudinal study was initiated in a young population deprived from regular dental care. the present communication describes the baseline cross-sectional data obtained in 1987 in terms of the clinical periodontal condition and prevalence of periodontal bacteria in the oral cavity. all inhabitants in the age range 15-25 years of a village with approximately 2000 inhabitants at a tea estate on western java, indonesia, were examined clinically and microbiologically. in total, 255 adolescents, comprising 130 males and 125 females participated in the study. samples for bacteriological examination were taken from the gingiva, the dorsum of the tongue, and the saliva. plaque index, bleeding upon probing, pocket depth, and attachment loss (al) were scored on the  approximal surfaces from the vestibular aspect of all teeth as well as the mid-vestibular and mid-lingual aspects of the ramfjord teeth. calculus was scored only on the 4 surfaces of the ramfjord teeth. following the clinical measurements, the deepest bleeding pocket with no clinical loss of attachment was sampled for microbiological examination. in addition, in 37 subjects a deep bleeding (> or = 4 mm) with at least 4 mm of attachment loss was sampled. moderate periodontitis (max. al 3-4 mm) was found in 26% of the population, advanced periodontitis (max. al > or = 5 mm) in 8%, whereas 66% of the population showed no or minor periodontitis (max. al 0-2 mm). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found in 57% of the population, porphyromonas gingivalis in 87%, prevotella intermedia and motile rods in all cases and spirochetes in 89%. p. gingivalis (66%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (37%) and spirochetes (63%) were, of all the sampled sites of the oral cavity, most frequently detected in pockets without attachment loss. motile rods were most prevalent on the tongue and in the saliva (92% and 89%, respectively). a high prevalence of the investigated periodontal bacteria was detected both in the pockets without and with attachment loss. no significant association between the  clinical periodontal parameters and the prevalence of the microorganisms was observed at a patient level. at a site level, both p. gingivalis and spirochetes  were more prevalent in sites with attachment loss. the actual role of these putative periodontal pathogens may be elucidated more extensively, when longitudinal data on the present population become available.

TI  == influence of smoking on the outcome of periodontal surgery. a 5-year follow-up.
AB  == the 5-year outcome following periodontal surgery was evaluated in 57 patients that had received regular maintenance care throughout the follow-up period. the study population included 20 smokers, 20 former smokers and 17 non-smokers in the age range 37-77 years. the clinical characteristics evaluated were supragingival  plaque, gingival bleeding and pocket probing depth. the region assigned for surgery was, in addition, radiographically evaluated in terms of periodontal bone height. furthermore, the occurrence of the periopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and prevotella intermedia (pi) and the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) levels of tumor necrosis  factor alpha (tnf-alpha) were assessed at follow-up. plaque index was 28.5% at baseline and 32.9% at follow-up, indicating a good standard of oral hygiene, and  gingival bleeding 31.7% and 24.9%, respectively, suggesting a low to moderate level of gingival inflammation. in regions assigned for surgery, pocket probing depth decreased significantly from on average 5.6 mm to 4.3 mm (p<0.0001) and periodontal bone height increased significantly from on average 62.5% to 67.5% (p<0.0001). in terms of bone height, the outcome was less favorable among smokers compared with non-smokers. there was a predominance of smokers among patients exhibiting loss of bone height after the 5 years of maintenance. no significant associations were found between the therapeutical outcome and supragingival plaque or subgingival occurrence of periopathogens. the associations between gcf  levels of tnf-alpha and probing depth and bone height were unclear, whereas the level of tnf-alpha was significantly elevated in smokers.

TI  == dental plaque flora of the dog with reference to fastidious and anaerobic bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == animal bite wounds are amongst the most common types of traumatic injuries in humans. the organisms isolated from these wounds generally reflect the oral flora of the biting animal, and may be fastidious in nature and difficult to identify.  this study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas and prevotella spp. in supragingival dental plaque collected from the right maxillary canine and carnassial teeth and the right mandibular canine tooth of dogs. in part one of the study, 30 dogs were used. e. corrodens was found in 62% of these dogs and 44% of individual plaque samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the dogs sampled. in part two, 34 dogs were used to determine the prevalence of the black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (porphyromonas and prevotella spp.). porphyromonas gingivalis was present in 68% of these dogs and 47% of individual plaque samples. prevotella intermedia was present in 44% of the dogs and 23% of individual plaque samples. the recently described porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas salivosa, porphyromonas cangingivalis, porphyromonas cansulci, porphyromonas crevioricanis and prevotella denticola species were isolated from only 9%, 6%, 3%, 3%, 3% and 3% of dogs respectively. porphyromonas gingivicanis was not isolated from any of the animals sampled. in conclusion, black-pigmented  anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 91% of the animals sampled and therefore constitute a significant risk with respect to bite wound infections. it is also suggested that the prevalence of e. corrodens in wound infections has been underestimated in previous reports because of use of inappropriate techniques for detecting this organism.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

AB  == this randomized controlled trial assessed the long-term maintenance of alveolar bone gain after implantation of autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogenic (aaa) bone. aaa bone is a demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft processed after previously described methods. in each of 14 patients, aaa bone was implanted into the intraosseous defect of 1 tooth (test); a second tooth with an intraosseous defect was treated by modified widman flap surgery alone (control). all patients  were offered supportive periodontal therapy at 3- to 6-month intervals following  treatment. clinical measurements were taken prior to surgery, 6 months, and 3 years following surgery. of the 14 patients enrolled, 11 patients completed the 6-month and 8 patients the 3-year examination. in test teeth, bone gain was significantly greater compared to control teeth at 6 months (2.2+/-0.5 mm and 1.2+/-0.5 mm, respectively) and 3 years (2.3+/-0.7 mm and 1.1+/-0.8 mm, respectively) (p < 0.05). also, more probing attachment was gained in test compared to control teeth at 3 years (2.0+/-0.7 mm and 0.8+/-0.5 mm, respectively; p < 0.05). at 3 years, porphyromonas gingivalis was detected in 3 test and 2 control teeth by polymerase chain reaction, whereas no actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans was found. due to the low detection frequency, there was no clear correlation between the maintenance of alveolar bone during supportive periodontal therapy and subgingival infection with p. gingivalis. the data indicated that alveolar bone gain after implantation of aaa bone may be maintained over a minimum of 3 years in patients receiving periodontal supportive therapy.

AB  == this study examined for 3 years the changes in periodontal status and the possible correlations with selected subgingival microbiota and diabetic conditions in a group of 16 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm, jd) patients as compared with their 16 healthy cohabiting siblings (hs). jd patients  were monitored every 3 months for levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c). clinical and microbiological parameters were measured 6 weeks before drawing blood to determine levels of hba1c. periodontal parameters were measured at baseline (to), year 2 (t2), year 3 (t3) and included: probing depth (pd), attachment level (al), sulcus bleeding index (sbi), and plaque index (pi). two sites in each patient were selected for microbial samples: a mesio-facial aspect  of the maxillary right first molar (defined as constant site, cs) and a site with the greatest probing depth (defined as deepest site, ds). microbial samples were  analyzed by culture techniques. no significant differences in clinical parameters were found between diabetics and healthy siblings at any examination. the sbi in  the non-diabetic group at t2 and at t3 was significantly lower than at baseline.  pd and al of constant sites in the diabetic group at t3 were significantly higher than baseline. there was a significant increase in prevotella intermedia at t3 as compared with baseline for deepest sites in the diabetic group. cluster analysis  revealed, in a former study, two clusters (iv and v) at baseline which were significantly different from the overall mean regarding composition of porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga spp. they were not significantly different for periodontal parameters from to to t3. these data would suggest no significant differences in clinical parameters between the diabetics and non-diabetic siblings throughout this 3-year longitudinal study.

TI  == rapid detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and porphyromona gingivalis by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the identification of specific periodontal pathogens by conventional methods, mainly anaerobic cultivation, is difficult, time consuming and even sometimes unreliable. therefore, a multiplex pcr method for simultaneous detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromona gingivalis (p.g.) and prevotella intermedia (p.i.) was developed for rapid and easy identification of these specific bacterial pathogens in subgingival plaque samples. in this paper,  there is a detailed description of the oligonucleotide primer selection, dna extraction and pcr conditions and the sequencing of the amplified products. the locus chosen to be amplified is a highly variable region in the 16s ribosomal dna. for the development of this technique atcc cultures and pure cultures from subgingival plaque samples taken from periodontitis patients were used. as an internal positive control a recombinant plasmid was developed. this simple dna extraction procedure and the dna amplification and visualization of the amplified product permits the detection of the bacteria in a working day. thus, this multiplex pcr method is a rapid and effective detection method for specific periodontal pathogens.

AB  == 28 patients, 13 smokers and 15 non-smokers with untreated advanced periodontal disease, were subjected to a series of oral hygiene instructions and treated with non-surgical periodontal therapy. baseline values regarding clinical data did not differ significantly between the groups. 6 months following therapy the full-mouth bleeding score among smokers was 36.5% as compared to 22.7% for non-smokers (p < 0.05). probing depth was reduced by 1.9 mm for smokers and by 2.5 mm for non-smokers. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). the level of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia/nigrescens was reduced in both groups as compared to baseline. a. actinonmycetemcomitans, however demonstrated a slight increase in mean values at 6 months. this was especially notable for smokers in which a. actinomycetemcomitans were more difficult to eradicate. conclusively, the microbiological response found in this study seems to be in conformity with the clinical response with little influence of the smoking habits.

TI  == local and systemic tcr v gene expression in advanced periodontal disease.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to study the expression of specific alpha/beta t cell receptor (tcr) gene products in relation to some microbiological and immunological features of advanced destructive periodontitis. 21 individuals with advanced periodontal disease (diseased group) and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (healthy group) were recruited. following a clinical examination of the diseased group, the 3 deepest interproximal sites in the upper and lower premolar- or molar segments (i.e., 12 sites in each individual) were selected for further analysis. samples from the subgingival microbiota were obtained from the pocket of the selected sites and were prepared for a microbiological examination. the gingival tissue at one of the selected sites was also biopsied. each excised soft tissue specimen was divided into 2 equal portions. one portion of the biopsy was prepared for histometric and morphometric analyses. the 2nd portion was snap frozen and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis. a sample of peripheral blood was obtained from each individual of the diseased and the healthy group and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis. the selected sites of the diseased group harbored varying numbers of microorganisms which have been associated with periodontal disease. the excised gingival tissue  contained inflammatory lesions with substantial numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells including t- and b-cells and a tcr v alpha/beta gene repertoire dominated by vbeta 17. the tcr profile of the lesion, however, differed markedly from that  of the circulating blood of the diseased subjects. while only minor differences were observed between the blood samples of the diseased and the healthy subjects  regarding the tcr genes, cd5, hla-dr and cd5+cd19 positive cells occurred in higher proportions in the blood samples of the subjects susceptible to periodontal disease than in healthy controls. it may be suggested that (i) tcr v  alpha/vbeta expression in peripheral blood samples of subjects with periodontal disease does not differ from that of healthy individuals, and (ii) the periodontitis lesion expresses a unique tcr repertoire in which the vbeta 17 gene dominates.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine microbiological changes after periodontal initial therapy by dna probe and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays in addition to clinical evaluation. twenty-six periodontitis patients, 10  males and 16 females, were selected. all subjects were treated by scaling and root planing following oral hygiene instruction. bacterial samples were collected with paper points from a total of 104 sites, 4 sites in each patient, at baseline and after initial therapy. dna probe analysis was used to monitor bacteroides forsythus and porphyromonas gingivalis. pcr analysis was performed to identify the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the initial therapy resulted in significant clinical improvements as assessed by clinical parameters  including pocket depth, attachment level and bleeding on probing. after the therapy, the detection frequency of b. forsythus and p. gingivalis was significantly reduced, but the detection frequency of a. actinomycetemcomitans did not significantly decreased. these results indicated that initial therapy can bring about elimination of b. forsythus and p. gingivalis by means of conventional techniques, but not of a. actinomycetemcomitans. when complete elimination of these microorganisms was obtained, significant clinical improvement was found. monitoring the changes of three bacteria may provide a more effective modality.

TI  == differential effects of systemic metronidazole and amoxicillin on actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in intraoral habitats.
AB  == 48 adult patients with untreated periodontitis harboring subgingival actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and/or porphyromonas gingivalis were randomly assigned to receive full mouth scaling alone (control) or scaling with systemic metronidazole plus amoxicillin and supragingivai irrigation with chlorhexidine digluconate (test). subgingival plaque and swab samples from tongue, tonsils, and buccal mucosa were taken at baseline, 10 days and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in the oral cavity, i.e., subgingival plaque and/or mucous membranes, less frequently in test patients compared to controls at 9 and 12 months (p<0.01), whereas, the intraoral detection frequency of p. gingivalis was significantly reduced only 10 days following therapy (p<0.001). at any time after therapy, a. actinomycetemcomitans  was not detected intraorally in 5 of 10 (50%) test and 1 of 13 (8%) control patients harboring this pathogen at baseline; p. gingivalis was not detected in only 1 of 18 (6%) test and none of the 17 control patients harboring this pathogen at baseline. although the data indicated that the assessed antimicrobial therapy may suppress a. actinomycetemcomitans from the entire oral cavity below detectable levels over a minimum of 12 months, p. gingivalis persisted or reoccurred.

TI  == salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and hiv infection status.
AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

TI  == oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == subgingival temperature: relation to gingival crevicular fluid enzymes, cytokines, and subgingival plaque micro-organisms.
AB  == there have been no reports on the relationship of subgingival temperature to specific gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) components. therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether there was any relationship between subgingival temperature and gcf levels of neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), beta-glucuronidase (bg), interleukin-1 alpha (il-1), and interferon alpha (ifn). furthermore, another objective was to confirm an association of subgingival temperature with clinical parameters and specific subgingival plaque micro-organisms as has been reported earlier. 27 human subjects each having healthy (n = 50), gingivitis (n = 59) and periodontitis (n = 53) sites were evaluated. the plaque index (pi), subgingival temperature, probing depth, attachment loss, bleeding index and gingival index were measured. gcf was  sampled following the measurement of the pi and removal of the supragingival plaque. gcf samples were assayed for the enzymes ne, bg, mpo and the cytokines ifn-alpha and il-1 alpha. a sterile gracey curette was utilized at each sampled site to collect subgingival plaque. the plaque samples were evaluated using an immunoassay. subgingival temperature was found to directly correlate with all clinical parameters (p < 0.001). significant, albeit not large, correlations were found between subgingival temperature and ne (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), mpo (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and bg (r = 0.23, p < 0.01). temperature was found to correlate  positively with e. corrodens (r = 0.33, p < 0.02) and f. nucleatum (r = 0.25, p < 0.05) but not with p. intermedia (r = 0.02, p = 0.9), p. gingivalis (r = 0.20, p  = 0.1) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (r = 0.01, p > 0.9). in conclusion, subgingival temperature is correlated with the gcf enzymes, ne, mpo and bg as well as the clinical parameters and specific plaque micro-organisms associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == periodontitis patient and the spouse: periodontal bacteria before and after treatment.
AB  == suspected periodontal pathogens can be transmitted between spouses. the treatment response may be unsuccessful in periodontitis patients, if the spouse harbors these bacteria. the aim of the present 6-month follow-up study was to clarify whether the microbiological treatment outcome of periodontitis patients is related to the detection of suspected periodontal pathogens in the saliva of the  spouse. 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and their spouses were included in the study. the patients received mechanical periodontal treatment and 500 mg metronidazole systemically 2x a day for 7 days. the presence of visible plaque, gingival bleeding after probing, suppuration, supragingival and subgingival calculus and pocket depths were assessed at baseline and 1 and 6 months after treatment. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus and peptostreptococcus micros were cultured from pooled subgingival samples from the  patients and from salivary samples from the spouses at corresponding occasions. periodontal conditions in the patients improved after treatment as determined by  the significantly lower values of clinical variables 1 and 6 months after treatment compared to those at baseline. however, the re-emergence of periodontal bacteria after treatment of the patients was not related to the concurrent detection of the respective bacteria in the saliva of the spouses. in this study  design, it seemed that the salivary bacterial load in the spouse was of minor importance for the microbiological treatment outcome of the patient.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis-susceptible subjects.
AB  == the present study evaluated the long-term effect of (i) meticulous self-performed, supragingival plaque control and (ii) the use of a triclosan/copolymer containing dentifrice in adult subjects susceptible to destructive periodontitis. 40 individuals were recruited into the trial. 3-5 years prior to the baseline examination, they had all been treated by nonsurgical means- for advanced periodontal disease. during the subsequent maintenance phase, all subjects had at different time intervals exhibited sites with recurrent periodontitis. at a baseline examination, 6 surfaces per tooth were examined regarding bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level. the deepest pocket site in each quadrant (i.e. 4 sites per subject) was selected and samples of the subgingival bacteria were taken. at baseline, all volunteers received detailed information on proper oral hygiene techniques. this  information was repeated on an individual need basis during the course of the subsequent 36-months. no professional subgingival therapy was delivered between the baseline and the 36-month examinations. the subjects were randomly distributed into 2 equal groups of 20 individuals each, 1 test and 1 control group. the members of the test group were supplied with a fluoridated dentifrice  containing triclosan/copolymer (total, colgate), while the controls received a corresponding dentifrice but without triclosan/copolymer. the findings demonstrated that in subjects with advanced and recurrent periodontitis, carefully practiced supragingival plaque control had some effects on the subgingival microbiota, but also that this was insufficient to prevent disease progression. in a corresponding group of subjects, however, who used a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice, the subgingival microbiota was reduced in both quantitative and qualitative terms and recurrent periodontitis was almost entirely prevented.

TI  == loss of deciduous teeth and germs of permanent incisors in a 4-year-old child. an atypic prepubertal periodontitis? a clinical, microbiological, immunological and  ultrastructural study.
AB  == a 4-year-old child was referred, in april 1988, to rennes dental school (france)  for deciduous tooth mobility with premature loss of 4 deciduous teeth and germs of 2 permanent incisors. microbiological examinations by culture revealed the presence of the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. immunofluorescence of plaque samples revealed the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis that had not been isolated by culture. neutrophil functions were within normal ranges. transmission electron microscopy of gingiva showed a disorganised epithelium. the connective tissue was infiltrated by inflammatory cells. the basement membranes were normal, but the connective tissue-epithelium interface was mainly composed of short rete pegs. scanning electron microscopy of extracted deciduous teeth revealed lack of cementum, lacunae in the cementum and  lack of fibrillar insertion on the middle part of the root. skin lesions, mainly  situated on face, were observed. treatment was by extraction of mobile deciduous  teeth combined with 3-week courses of metronidazole. clinical and microbiological follow-up was continued over a 7-year period. no periodontal lesions have been detected since eruption of the permanent teeth. the present subgingival and lingual microflora (december 1995) is composed of bacteria associated with periodontal health. however, the future appearance of a hitherto undetected systemic disease is still possible.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == reduced serum igg reactivities with bacteria from dental plaque in hiv-infected persons with periodontitis.
AB  == serum samples were obtained from 44 hiv-seropositive (hiv+) and 37 hiv-seronegative (hiv-) persons that were grouped according to periodontal status. serum igg and iga reactivities towards streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis. prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by means of elisa. hiv+ persons with chronic marginal periodontitis showed significantly lower igg reactivities to the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum as compared  with their hiv- counterparts (p < 0.05). specific serum iga reactivities were similar in the two periodontitis groups, except for p. nigrescens where the hiv+  group with chronic marginal periodontitis had lower values than their systemically healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). the results indicate that hiv infection affects the humoral serum immune responses against bacteria in dental plaque; the depressed antibody responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility for periodontal infections in hiv-infected patients.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of young adults with and without early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the associations between putative periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis (eop) in a population of 248 subjects, 13 to 19 years of age at baseline, derived from a representative sample of u.s. young adults. the subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of attachment loss at baseline. the attachment level was assessed clinically at baseline and at a 6-year follow-up examination, and the presence of 7 bacterial species was assessed at follow-up using dna probes. the individuals were classified into generalized, localized, incidental eop, and no-periodontitis groups based on the  extent and severity of attachment loss; and classified as having rapid, moderate, slow, and no progression based on the rate of periodontal progression during the  6 preceding years. in the eop groups there were significantly higher percentages  of individuals with detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola. in addition, the eop group had significantly higher levels of these 5  microorganisms compared to the no-periodontitis group. there were also higher percentages of individuals with these species and higher levels of bacteria in the group showing disease progression than the group without progression. in a descending order of importance, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and p. intermedia were the microorganisms significantly associated with the generalized and/or rapidly progressing disease. f. nucleatum and c. rectus were also associated with eop, but to a lesser degree. in the present population actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly associated with eop, though it was recovered more often from subjects with localized eop. eikenella corrodens was present equally in subjects with and without disease. the results show that several bacterial species are associated with eop, and that p. gingivalis and t.  denticola are of particular importance and may play a significant role in the more severe and progressive forms of eop.

TI  == elimination of bacteria on different implant surfaces through photosensitization  and soft laser. an in vitro study.
AB  == microbiologic examinations of implants have shown that certain microorganisms described as periodontal pathogens may have an influence on the development and the progression of peri-implant disease. this experimental study aimed to examine the bactericidal effect of irradiation with a soft laser on bacteria associated with peri-implantitis following exposure to a photosensitizing substance. platelets made of commercially pure titanium, either with a machined surface or with a hydroxyapatite or plasma-flame-sprayed surface or with a corundum-blasted  and etched surface, were incubated with a pure suspension of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis or prevotella intermedia. the surfaces were then treated with a toluidine blue solution and irradiated with a diode soft laser with a wave length of 905 nm for 1 min. none of the smears obtained from the thus treated surfaces showed bacterial growth, whereas the smears obtained from surfaces that had been subjected to only one type of treatment showed unchanged growth of every target organism tested (p < 0.0006). electron microscopic inspection of the thus treated platelets revealed that combined dye/laser treatment resulted in the destruction of bacterial cells. the  present in vitro results indicate that lethal photosensitization may be of use for treatment of peri-implantitis.

AB  == protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and  chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. the elastase-like activity was strongest in capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others  were greatest in capnocytophaga gingivalis. the latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease  activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to p. gingivalis. treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.

TI  == a 5-year study of attachment loss and tooth loss in community-dwelling older adults.
AB  == tooth loss is a widely recognized endpoint measure for the effects of periodontal diseases and the impact of periodontal therapy. in fact, traditional clinical measures of periodontal status often are considered to be surrogate endpoints in  that they are assumed to be related to tooth loss. however, the strength of the relationship between attachment loss and tooth loss in a representative population of untreated subjects has not been studied extensively. the purpose of this paper is to present the trends in attachment loss over a 5-yr period in a population of community-dwelling elderly blacks and whites. specifically, this paper presents attachment loss trends both at the person and tooth level to address the following issues; 1) whether teeth that experience attachment loss during 1 time period are more likely to be lost at the next time period; and 2) given similar levels of attachment loss, why are some people more likely to lose  teeth? in 1988, the university of north carolina school of dentistry initiated the piedmont 65+ dental study, which was designed to elicit 800 dentate respondents in the 5-country area who were examined again at 18, 36 and 60 months. our findings indicated that teeth with poorer attachment level at baseline had a higher probability of being lost during the next 5 yr and teeth that experienced attachment loss during a time period were more likely to be lost during the next time period than teeth without additional attachment loss. in addition, it appears that there are person-level characteristics associated with  increasing tendency towards tooth loss in people with similar periodontal status, a finding that may clarify the relationship between attachment loss and tooth loss.

TI  == the survival rate of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus following 4 randomized treatment modalities.
AB  == the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine the short-term anti-infective effects of four randomized treatment modalities on actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and bacteroides forsythus (bf) and determine the effects of bacterial survival on treatment outcomes in patients with adult periodontitis. twelve adult patients requiring therapy for moderate periodontitis were selected for this study. all patients had at least one tooth in each quadrant that had an inflamed pocket of probing depth  > or =5 mm with probing attachment loss that harbored at least one of the following three periodontal pathogens: aa, pg, or bf. the number of target organisms per site was determined pre-operatively, at 1 week, and 1 month and 3 months postoperatively utilizing dna probes. one quadrant in each patient was randomly assigned to each one of the following four treatment groups: 1) scaling  and root planing (srp group); 2) pocket reduction through osseous surgery and apically-positioned flap (os group); 3) modified widman flap (mwf group); and 4)  modified widman flap and topical application of saturated citric acid at ph 1 for 3 minutes (ca group). the 4 treatment modalities were performed in one appointment. no postoperative antibiotics were used. patients were instructed to  supplement their daily oral hygiene with chlorohexidine oral rinse during the study. the results of this investigation indicated that: 1) none of the treatment modalities was effective in eliminating the target species; 2) the incidence of infected sites for all groups was 100% preoperatively; 62.5%, 33.3%, and 31.3% at 1 week, and 1 and 3 months postoperatively, respectively; 3) these infected sites lost 1.1 +/- 0.4 mm of probing attachment compared to gain of 0.0 +/- 0.3 mm for  uninfected sites; 4) the infected sites had higher plaque and bleeding on probing 0.9 +/- 0.3, 73 +/- 12%, respectively, compared to 0.3 +/- 0.1 and 30 +/- 8% for  the uninfected sites; and 5) no statistically significant differences were detected among the infected sites in regard to gingival index (1.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.1) or probing depth (3.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.1 mm). these results indicate that bacterial survival negatively affects the short-term clinical outcomes of non-surgical and surgical periodontal therapy.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to monitor the microbiological and clinical effects of renewed supra- and subgingival debridement in conjunction with systemic metronidazole therapy (500 mg tid for 7 days) in 27 "refractory" periodontitis patients, culture positive for bacteroides forsythus and negative for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. clinical evaluation included assessment of plaque, bleeding upon probing, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss at the deepest, bleeding site in each quadrant. microbiological evaluation was carried out by anaerobic cultivation of subgingival plaque samples from the same sites. 6 months after renewed debridement and systemic metronidazole (rd+m), a statistically significant improvement of all clinical parameters was observed,  except for the plaque index. after rd+m, b. forsythus was suppressed below detection level in 17 of the 27 patients, p. gingivalis in 9 out of 15 patients and p. intermedia in 14 of the 21 patients. before rd+m, 12 patients harboured simultaneously b. forsythus, p. gingivalis as well as p. intermedia. out of these, 6 patients were culture negative for the 3 species after therapy and showed the greatest reduction in pocket depth (3.1 mm) and gain of clinical attachment level (2.5 mm). in the treatment of refractory periodontitis, associated with patients culture positive for b. forsythus and negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans, metronidazole can significantly improve the clinical and microbiological parameters.

AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == pathogenicity of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolates in a wound chamber model in rabbits.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 14 isolates identified as prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens by serogrouping using monoclonal antibodies was compared in a tissue cage model in rabbits. seven strains from periodontal abscesses, 5 strains from deep periodontal pockets and 2 strains from gingivitis were tested in the animal model comprising 6 teflon tissue cages implanted on the back each of 34 rabbits. a total of 10(5)-10(8) cells of p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains were inoculated alone or together with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or streptococcus mitis. five strains of porphyromonas gingivalis were used as a reference. the infectivity was recorded as pus formation and log viable count in aspirated material for 3, 7 and 14 days. none of the prevotella strains inoculated in monoculture survived more than 3 days, and they had no capacity to produce abscess. p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains in combination with a. actinomycetemcomitans produced abscesses in 33-100% and with s. mitis in 42-100%. no difference in abscess formation or log viable count in samples after 14 days was recorded between serogroup i (p. intermedia) and serogroup ii and iii (p. nigrescens). the infectivity of p. intermedia or p. nigresceas strains did not differ whether they were isolated from periodontal abscess, periodontal pocket or gingivitis. p. intermedia and p.  nigrescens strains produced abscesses in combination with a facultative anaerobic strain and appears to have a similar pathogenicity in the wound chamber model in  rabbits.

TI  == extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  == in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration  range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the  cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did  not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.

TI  == the bactericidal effects of dental ultrasound on actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. an in vitro investigation.
AB  == this study investigated the possible bactericidal acoustic effects of the dental  ultrasonic scaler. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis suspensions, were subjected to the vibrations of a cavitron p1 insert  for 2.5 and 5.0 min in an acoustically-simulated pocket model and the survivors enumerated. the extent of any cavitation occurring within the pocket model to which the statistically significant bactericidal activity observed might be attributed, was determined by 'sonoluminescence', which was then investigated by  photomultiplication techniques. however, these failed to detect any sonoluminescence within the pocket space and, moreover, the necessary deflection  of the water coolant away from the insert tip, to avoid flooding of the experimental pocket, proved to result in temperatures of 47.6 degrees c and 52.3  degrees c at the respective time intervals, and thereby constituted an alternative possible bactericidal mechanism. examination of the effects of such temperature changes on the target bacteria then revealed statistically significant differences in the viable counts of both microorganisms after 5.0-min periods, and as such were comparable to those previously detected in relation to  the pocket model. whilst it must be presumed that the bacteriolytic effect observed in the main investigation was due to the incidental temperature changes, in the absence of acoustic cavitation the influence of any associated acoustic microstreaming cannot be discounted. further investigations to assess the bactericidal potential of acoustic phenomena using a modified experimental to exclude any hyperthermic effects are therefore necessary.

TI  == bacterial transmission in periodontal diseases: a critical review.
AB  == this review paper addresses intra- and extra-familial transfer of bacteria associated with periodontal diseases. recent advances in molecular biology provide sensitive methods to differentiate organisms within the same species, thereby facilitating tracking routes of their transmission. evidence for the passing of microorganisms between parents and children is particularly strong. in this regard, molecular genetic techniques have demonstrated that if a child is colonized by a potentially pathogenic species, then one of the parents will usually harbor genotypically identical bacteria. the data also indicate that transfer of bacteria between spouses occur, but it appears to happen infrequently. saliva appears to be a major vector for bacterial transmission. however, the transfer of organisms does not necessarily result in colonization or infection of the host. furthermore, individuals who harbor putative pathogens frequently do not manifest any signs of periodontal disease. this is attributed to host defenses, bacterial antagonism, and possibly lack of pathogenicity of infecting organisms. it is concluded, based upon current evidence, that periodontal pathogens are communicable; however, they are not readily transmissible.

TI  == 5 alpha reductase activity in human gingiva and gingival fibroblasts in response  to bacterial culture supernatants, using [14c]4-androstenedione as substrate.
AB  == 5 alpha-reduction of androgen substrates is increased in inflamed gingiva. it was therefore relevant to study the effect of bacterial culture supernatants derived  from prevotella intermedius (p.i), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) on the metabolism of [14c]4-androstenedione to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (dht) in gingival tissue and cultured fibroblasts. chronically inflamed human gingival tissue and cultured gingival fibroblasts from the same source were incubated in duplicate with [14c]4-androstenedione and optimal concentrations of p.i, p.g. and a.a culture supernatants in eagle's minimal essential medium in a co2 incubator for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the metabolites were then extracted, separated and quantified using a radioisotope scanner. there were 87, 50 and 6% increases in dht synthesis by human gingival tissue in response to the culture supernatants of p.i, p.g and a.a, respectively, over control incubations (n = 3; p < 0.01: wilcoxon signed-ranked statistic for paired observations). with the cells in culture, all  four fibroblast cell lines produced dht and testosterone from [14c]4-androstenedione in varying amounts. the production of dht was enhanced in  the presence of each the bacterial culture supernatants to varying degrees (p.i 40%, p.g 35% and a.a 40%; p < 0.01). combinations of the bacterial extracts: (p.i + p.g), (p.i + a.a), (p.g + a.a) and (p.i + p.g + a.a) showed intermediate or suppressor effects on dht formed compared with individual incubations. culture supernatants of these pathogens can influence dht synthesis in fibroblasts, and effect that is modulated by baseline androgen metabolism and the proportion of virulent pathogens present. this may have some bearing on host susceptibility on  host and the progression of the periodontal lesion.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of subgingival antimicrobial irrigation with citric acid as evaluated by an enzyme immunoassay and culture analysis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to compare an enzyme immunoassay with culture samples from untreated and non-surgically treated periodontal pockets and to assess the clinical and microbiological effects of citric acid irrigation as a supplement to scaling and root planing. the enzyme immunoassay used in this study is a chairside diagnostic tool aimed at identifying the presence of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans. six sites with pocket depths > or = 6 mm in each of 16 patients were monitored for 24 weeks using clinical and microbiological parameters. in two out of the six sites, scaling and root planing was supplemented with subgingival citric acid irrigation of the pocket after completion of the mechanical treatment. the sensitivity of the immunoassay in relation to culture was calculated to 85.5% and the specificity to 90.2%. the immunoassay corresponded to a detection level of 10(4) as estimated by culture. sites treated with a combination of scaling and irrigation with citric acid demonstrated a similar healing pattern as sites treated with scaling and root planing alone. the profile of the marker bacteria was almost parallel for the two groups. the results of this investigation thus indicated that the immunoassay can be used as a screening tool for selected periodontal pathogens and that adjunctive irrigation with citric acid has no measurable clinical or microbiological effects.

TI  == development of resistance to metronidazole and minocycline in vitro.
AB  == by local delivery of antibiotics to periodontal pockets, very high initial concentrations are often quickly succeeded by subinhibitory concentrations, which may facilitate development of bacterial resistance. the purpose of the present study was to investigate possible development of resistance in suspected periodontal pathogens after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of metronidazole and minocycline. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 18 reference strains and 12 clinical isolates was determined by a broth dilution method. subsequently, all strains with mic < 8 micrograms/ml were exposed to serial passage on plates containing subinhibitory and gradually increasing concentrations of antibiotics, until growth was inhibited. initially, most strains were inhibited at < or = 0.250 microgram/ml of minocycline and < or = 0.5 microgram/ml of metronidazole, though a. actinomycetemcomitans was resistant to metronidazole. after growth at subinhibitory concentrations, 8 strains survived 1-2 x and 11 stains survived 8-32 x their initial mic of metronidazole, growing at up to 8 micrograms/ml. all a. actinomycetemcomitans survived 8-64 x their initial mic of minocycline, growing at > or = 2 micrograms/ml, while all other strains were inhibited at < or = 0.250 microgram/ml, corresponding to a 1-8 x increase in their initial mic. thus, development of resistance was observed for periodontal bacteria growing at up to 64 x their initial mic, but the final level of resistance was moderate.

TI  == secretion of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, il-8 and il-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. it was recently demonstrated that pmn have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these  capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. we therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-8 and il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) secreted by pmn from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea and fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium escherichia coli. a actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. coli lps stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 than the control unstimulated pmn (p < 0.01). the levels of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 released from cells stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans or e. coli lps (p < 0.05). on the other hand, substantially greater amounts of il-1ra were released from pmn stimulated with each lps and from control unstimulated pmn during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of il-1ra were secreted by pmn stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans and e.coli lps during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). the inhibitory effects of il-1ra on the biological activity of il-1 in the supernatants of pmn were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. the supernatants of pmn stimulated with each lps showed less biological il-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human il-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of pmn stimulated with  p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps. these findings demonstrated that lps from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating pmn to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as il-1ra. different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various lps might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the microbiota on  the oral mucosal surfaces and in the peri-implant pocket in edentulous subjects with a past history of periodontitis. twenty edentulous subjects wearing dental implants for at least one year and with a history of periodontitis participated in this study. clinical parameters were assessed (plaque, redness, swelling, peri-implant probing depth [pipd], and bleeding on probing) and microbiological samples were taken (oral mucosal surfaces, saliva, plaque, and peri-implant pocket). based on the clinical results, the group as a whole showed healthy peri-implant tissues. a mean pipd of 3.6 mm was found. a statistically significant correlation was found between the pipd and bleeding upon probing, plaque scores, redness, and swelling. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected. the subjects harboring prevotella intermedia showed presence of pipd of > or = 5 mm. all subjects harbored peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and other prevotella species. actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, pseudomonas spp., and enterobacteria were detected less frequently. three subjects showed signs of overt soft tissue inflammation. they harbored higher proportions of peptostreptococcus spp. than the other subjects. the results corroborate the suggestion that the primary source of colonization for dental implants in edentulous patients are the oral mucous membranes. the results indicate that the microbiota of subjects wearing dental implants with a past history of periodontitis are composed of bacteria associated with a healthy periodontium or gingivitis. it is suggested that elimination of the subgingival environment by extraction of all natural teeth probably initiates the disappearance of the two periodontal bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis.

AB  == the present study describes results on selected clinical and microbiological parameters obtained by treatment with local (elyzol) and systemic (flagyl) use of metronidazole alone and/or mechanical subgingival debridement in adult periodontitis. patients were randomly divided into local and systemic treatment groups each comprising 5 individuals in each of whom 4 sites (one site/ quadrant) with a probing depth of > or = 5 mm were selected and treated with separate treatment modalities. the overall treatment design provided 6 different test groups. groups of quadrants received: (1) scaling and root planing; (2) local metronidazole treatment; (3) systemic metronidazole treatment; (4) local metronidazole combined with scaling and root planing; (5) systemic metronidazole  combined with scaling and root planing; (6) no treatment. the microbiological and clinical effects of treatment modalities were monitored over a period of 42 days. all treatments resulted in clinical improvements (gingivitis, probing pocket depth, attachment level) except for the untreated group. parallel to the clinical changes, all treatments reduced the number of total bacteria and proportions of obligately anaerobic microorganisms. although both of the combined treatment groups responded to therapy with better resolution of infection that the pure mechanical and pure metronidazole treatments, local metronidazole in combination  with scaling and root planing seems to be more effective in terms of producing both clinical and microbial improvements.

TI  == bacterial reduction in periodontal pockets through irradiation with a diode laser: a pilot study.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == models of invasion of enteric and periodontal pathogens into epithelial cells: a  comparative analysis.
AB  == bacterial invasion of epithelial cells is associated with the initiation of infection by many bacteria. to carry out this action, bacteria have developed remarkable processes and mechanisms that co-opt host cell function and stimulate  their own uptake and adaptation to the environment of the host cell. two general  types of invasion processes have been observed. in one type, the pathogens (e.g., salmonella and yersinia spp.) remain in the vacuole in which they are internalized and replicate within the vacuole. in the other type, the organism (e.g., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, shigella flexneri, and listeria monocytogenes) is able to escape from the vacuole, replicate in the host cell cytoplasm, and spread to adjacent host cells. the much-studied enteropathogenic bacteria usurp primarily host cell microfilaments for entry. those organisms which can escape from the vacuole do so by means of hemolytic factors and c type  phospholipases. the cell-to-cell spread of these organisms is mediated by microfilaments. the investigation of invasion by periodontopathogens is in its infancy in comparison with that of the enteric pathogens. however, studies to date on two invasive periodontopathogens. a actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, reveal that these bacteria have developed invasion strategies and mechanisms similar to those of the enteropathogens. entry of a. actinomycetemcomitans is mediated by microfilaments, whereas entry of p. gingivalis is mediated by both microfilaments and microtubules. a. actinomycetemcomitans, like shigella and listeria, can escape from the vacuole and spread to adjacent cells. however, the spread of a. actinomycetemcomitans is  linked to host cell microtubules, not microfilaments. the paradigms presented establish that bacteria which cause chronic infections, such as periodontitis, and bacteria which cause acute diseases, such as dysentery, have developed similar invasion strategies.

TI  == interactions between periodontopathogenic bacteria and cytokines.
AB  == cytokines produced in response to plaque bacteria clearly play a key role in the  periodontal diseases. however, we know very little about the interactions between cytokines and periodontopathogenic bacteria. the aims of this study were to determine whether the key pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta) and il-6 could affect the growth of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis and to determine whether these organisms could hydrolyse il-1 beta, il-6 or the anti-inflammatory il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra). culture medium containing up to 100 ng/ml of il-1 beta or il-6 was inoculated with a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes a, b and c) or p. gingivalis and growth  was monitored by measuring changes in electrical conductivity every 3 min for up  to 48 h. il-1 beta, il-6 or il-1ra were added to culture supernatants and incubated for up to 24 h. samples were taken at various times, analysed by sds-page and the separated proteins transferred by western blotting to pvdf membranes and probed with anti-cytokine antibodies. none of the cytokines tested  had any effect on the rate of growth or yield of a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis. supernatants from p. gingivalis cultures, but not those from a. actinomycetemcomitans, hydrolysed il-1 beta, il-6 and il-1ra. the hydrolysate from the p. gingivalis supernatant-treated il-1 beta was unable to stimulate the  release of il-6 from human gingival fibroblasts showing that it had lost biological activity. these results suggest that p. gingivalis can perturb the cytokine network, not only by stimulating the release of cytokines from host cells, but also by removing them from its local environment.

AB  == short-chain carboxylic acids (e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which can accumulate in the gingival crevice. it is of no small consequence, therefore, that 1- to 5-mm concentrations of these acids exhibit significant biological activity, including  the ability to alter cell proliferation and gene expression in cells of importance to the periodontium. this communication reports on the in vivo concentrations of propionic and butyric acid in the gingival crevices of periodontal subjects with severe and mild disease. the results indicated that severely diseased subjects exhibited a > 10-fold increase in the mm concentration of these acids when compared with mildly diseased subjects (mean propionic acid-severe = 9.5 +/- 1.8 mm, and mild = 0.8 +/- 0.3 mm; mean butyric acid-severe = 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm, and mild = 0.2 +/- 0.04 mm). these differences (mean +/- se) were significant (p < 0.0001). the propionic and butyric acid concentrations were below detection limits in healthy sites of mildly diseased subjects. the propionic and butyric acid concentrations also associated significantly with clinical measures of disease severity (e.g., pocket depth, attachment level) and  inflammation (e.g., subgingival temperature, % of sites bleeding when probed), and with the total microbial load (all p < 0.05). taken together, these data suggest that short-chain carboxylic acids play a mediating role in periodontal disease pathogenesis.

TI  == effect of orthodontic therapy with fixed and removable appliances on oral microbiota: a six-month longitudinal study.
AB  == the present study evaluated microbiological and clinical changes occurring during the first six months of orthodontic therapy with fixed and removable appliances and the consequent risk for gingivitis and periodontal disease. this study was justified by the disagreement among different authors: only some of them reported gingivitis development and changes in dental plaque composition during orthodontic therapy with fixed appliances, others did not. thirty, 7-to-15-year-old children, fifteen with fixed and fifteen with removable appliances, previously motivated to oral hygiene, completed the study. they were  clinically examined by a dentist at baseline and at the end of the study. three supra and subgingival microflora samples were collected from the first molars, when the appliances were inserted (t0), 6-8 weeks later (t1) and 6-7 months later (t2). microflora was examined using dark-field and light microscopes and cultural methods. an indicator of healthy status (percentage of gram positive cocci in total bacterial count) and some risk indicators for gingivitis (bacterial count evaluated with light microscope, percentage of gram negative rods) and for periodontitis (motile rod and spirochete percentages, presumptive actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence) were investigated. patients with fixed appliances were clinically healthy at t2; yet they showed significantly increased counts, motile rods, subgingival spirochetes and a decrease of gram positive cocci. at t2, patients with removable appliances were clinically healthy and the only significant microbiological changes were supragingival motile rods and subgingival spirochetes. these data suggest that in the oral hygiene motivated patients of the present study, gingivitis and periodontitis do not occur, during the first six months of treatment: the significant modification of oral microbiota, shown by subjects with fixed appliances, however, suggests that the risk for gingivitis in the following months of therapy is still high and the risk for periodontitis cannot be excluded.

TI  == alveolar bone loss in rats infected with a strain of prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from a child with prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  == prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum are associated with various forms of periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to infect the  clinical isolates of these periodontopathic bacteria and to induce a significant  loss of alveolar bone in specific pathogen-free (spf) rats in the absence of ligatures. p. intermedia ykd8 and f. nucleatum ykz5 were isolated from a prepubertal periodontitis patient, while p. gingivalis mwb13 was from a patient with juvenile periodontitis. at first, spf sprague-dawley rats (70 days of age, male) were infected with a. viscosus ny1r and subsequently superinfected with p.  gingivalis mwb13, p. intermedia ykd8, or f. nucleatum ykz5, respectively. the control group was infected with a. viscosus ny1r alone. all rats were killed and  periodontal bone levels were assessed morphometrically 135 days after the first infection with a. viscosus. p. intermedia ykd8 was recovered frequently from rats, with serum antibody levels remaining highly elevated throughout the experiment. significant loss of alveolar bone was found in rats infected with p.  intermedia ykd8, the virulence of which was equivalent to that of p. gingivalis mwb13. f. nucleatum ykz5 also induced alveolar bone loss, but not significantly when compared with rats infected with a. viscosus ny1r alone.

TI  == likelihood of transmitting actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in families with periodontitis.
AB  == this study examined the frequency of spouse-to-spouse and parent-child transmission of the periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (124 subjects in 47 families) and porphyromonas gingivalis (78 subjects in 31 families). the two test organisms were recovered from subgingival and tongue surface specimens using established microbiological techniques. arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-pcr) was used to genetically characterize isolates of the test species. the probability of isolating identical ap-pcr types of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis in family members by chance was estimated from the ap-pcr genotype distribution of the two species among unrelated individuals. a probability of 5% or less for occurrence by chance alone suggests intra-familial transmission. with a bacterium-positive spouse, a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed inter-spousal transmission in 4/11 (36%) married couples and p. gingivalis in 2/10 (20%) married couples. parent-child transmission of a. actinomycetemcomitans took place in 6/19 (32%) families. p. gingivalis was not transmitted from parent to child in any of the study families. the intra-familial transmission of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis may in part explain a familial pattern of periodontitis and may have important prophylactic and treatment implications.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

TI  == extracts of periodontopathic microorganisms lack functional superantigenic activity for murine t cells.
AB  == products of periodontopathic bacteria exert immunomodulatory effects on various lymphoid cell populations, some of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. it has recently been suggested that some of these bacterial products may possess superantigenic (sag) activity. sag bind simultaneously to the v beta chain of t cell receptors and to class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules, thereby activating as many as 35% of t cells to proliferate and produce cytokines. in order to examine this question, the proliferation of splenic and thymic t cells from immunologically naive, 3-6-wk-old balb/c (h-2d),  c57bl/6 (h-2b) and c3h/hej (h-2k) mice was assessed in response to sonic extracts of periodontopathogens. laboratory and/or reference strains of a.o. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were used as stimulants. staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), a known superantigen, was utilized as a positive control. unfractionated spleen cells responded to several of the tested preparations of the different bacteria, as well as to seb, con a and escherichia coli lps. thymocytes responded to con a and seb, but not to lps or to any sonic extract. spleen cells depleted of b cells by panning responded to seb and con a, but not to lps and showed a reduced response to sonicates. the residual response of b cell-depleted spleen cells was reduced essentially to background by treatment with anti-thy 1.2 + c'. similar results were obtained in the presence of 5% added mitomycin-treated antigen presenting cells, indicating that these cells were not  limiting. these results demonstrate that extracts of periodontopathic bacteria do not stimulate murine t cells in a manner consistent with superantigenic activation.

TI  == the adherence of periodontopathogens to periodontal probes. a possible factor in  intra-oral transmission?
AB  == periodontal probes have previously been shown to harbor several bacterial types or species after probing periodontally diseased pockets. this study aims to identify and quantify periodontopathogens that may adhere to a periodontal probe  by culturing techniques. it also examines the probe's roughness on its capability to collect bacteria, comparing merrit-b probes (with deep indentations) with tps  probes (with smooth surfaces). from the differential phase contrast microscopy findings it was seen that, while paper-points harbored nearly 50% motile rods or  spirochetes, the periodontal probes were just at, or below, the 20% threshold level for pathogenicity (23.6% for the merrit-b probe and 11.3% for the tps probe). the cultural data showed that paper-points had significantly higher (p <  0.05) numbers of anaerobic bacteria than the 2 probe types, which still harbored  up to 10(7) cfu. no significant differences could be detected between the probes. when specific periodontopathic species were considered, it was seen that for all  species, even for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis, the detection frequency was comparable for the 3 sampling devices. however, the levels of prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was significantly higher in samples from paper-points (p < 0.05), but still their numbers reached even 10(5) on the probes. differences among the 2 probe types were again negligible. periodontal probes harbor relatively high numbers of bacteria found in periodontal pockets and may be able to carry them over to other sites. further studies are needed to determine if, and to what extent, transmission occurs during periodontal probing.

TI  == microbiological response to mechanical treatment in combination with adjunctive therapy. a review of the literature.
AB  == the recognition of the microbial origin and the specificity of periodontal infections has resulted in the development of several adjunctive therapies (antibiotics and/or antiseptics) to scaling and root planing in the treatment of  chronic adult periodontitis. this article aims to review the "additional" effect  of a subgingival irrigation with chlorhexidine, or a local or systemic application of tetracycline or metronidazole, performed in combination with a single course of scaling and root planing in patients with chronic adult periodontitis. all treatment modalities are compared with scaling and root planing, based on their impact on: the probing depth (pd); total number of colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml); the proportions and/or the detection-frequency of  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia; and/or on the percentages of cocci, spirochetes, motile, and other micro-organisms on dark field microscopy examination. all treatment modalities, including scaling and root planing without additional chemical therapy, resulted  in significant reductions in the probing depth and the proportions of periodontopathogens, at least during the first 8 weeks post-therapy. however in comparison to a single course of scaling and root planing, the supplementary effect of adjunctive therapies seems to be limited. in general, only the irrigation with chlorhexidine 2%, the local application of minocycline, and the systemic use of metronidazole (in case of large proportions of spirochetes) or doxycycline (in case of large proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans) seem to result in a prolonged supplementary effect when compared to scaling and root planing. therefore, the use of antibiotics on a routine basis, especially in a systemic way, in the treatment of chronic adult periodontitis, can no longer be advocated, considering the increasing danger for the development of microbial resistance.

TI  == longitudinal evaluation of the development of periodontal destruction in spouses.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to study longitudinally the periodontal  condition of married couples. the data are derived from a longitudinal study in a young population living in a remote village in indonesia and showing a relatively high prevalence of periodontal destruction. in 23 married couples, clinical measurements were carried out in 1987 and 1994. during the latter examination, a  pooled gingival sample was obtained for microbiological evaluation. in 1994, the  mean age of the group was 29.1 years and the couples were married for on the average 10 years. in each couple, the partner showing in 1994 the highest score for mean loss of attachment (la) was classified as the diseased proband and the other partner as the spouse. evaluation of the clinical data showed that: (1) the diseased probands already had in 1987 a worse periodontal condition compared to that of the spouses; (2) in both groups the mean la increased during the 7-year period; (3) the difference in mean la between diseased probands and spouses increased between 1987 and 1994. the microbiological evaluation revealed a relatively high prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (50%), porphyromonas gingivalis (67%) and prevotella intermedia 61%. analysis showed no  differences in microbiota between diseased probands and spouses. the 23 actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans positive subjects included 2 positive couples. furthermore, the 31 porphyromonas gingivalis and 28 prevotella intermedia positive subjects included 9 and 7 positive couples respectively. in conclusion, 10 years of cohabitation showed no influence on the periodontal condition of the spouses.

TI  == risk indicators for periodontal disease in a racially diverse urban population.
AB  == a cross-sectional study of 117 subjects from a dental clinic serving a diverse population (i.e., whites, african-americans, native-americans, and asians) was performed to evaluate risk indicators of periodontal disease. gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and subgingival plaque were taken at the same visit from 4 posterior  sites of the most diseased sextant in each subject. age, smoking packyears, beta-glucuronidase (beta g), neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum), and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) were significantly (p < 0.05-0.005) correlated with attachment loss.  probing depth was significantly correlated with smoking packyears, beta g, ne, mpo, f. nucleatum and prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) (p < 0.05-0.005). mean ne value of whites was lower than the mean ne values of african-americans, native-americans and asians (p < 0.05). whites had a lower mean beta g value compared to african americans, and a lower mean mpo value compared to african americans and native americans. the %s of patients positive for f. nucleatum, p.  intermedia and eikenella corrodens (e. corrodens) were higher in native americans compared to whites. step-wise multiple regression analysis was performed to construct models for the estimation of probing depth and attachment loss. the most parsimonious regression models which had the best r2 values included the following variables and accounted for the indicated % of variability: models 1 and 2: beta g, race, and f. nucleatum accounted for 50% of the variability in mean probing depth and 39% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for  probing depth, respectively; model 3: age, beta g, and f. nucleatum accounted for 53% of the variability in mean attachment loss; model 4: age, ne, and f. nucleatum explained 35% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for attachment loss. the results suggest that age, race, smoking packyears, beta g, ne, mpo, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are risk indicators for periodontal disease in this racially diverse urban population. regression models  which include multiple variables (i.e., demographic factors, gcf enzymes and periodontopathic bacteria) can be used to estimate periodontal disease status.

TI  == studies of proliferative responses by long-term-cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells to bacterial components associated with periodontitis.
AB  == freezing techniques provide a means for repeating and extending immunological assays with frozen aliquots of an individual's peripheral blood mononuclear cell  fraction. lymphocytes which are stored frozen for a limited time retain their ability to respond to polyclonal b-cell activators, mitogens, and antigens of dental interest. our studies extend these previous findings by determining lymphocyte functional activity following frozen storage for up to 100 weeks. in addition, the autologous immune response was measured by spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation following 0, 1, 40, and 60 weeks of frozen storage. peak responses  for all individuals occurred at day 7 of incubation. the lymphocyte proliferative response to the superantigens toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1) and staphylococcus enterotoxin a (sea) were not changed after 100 weeks of frozen storage. maximum responses varied among the individuals but occurred at equivalent stimulator concentrations. however, slopes generated from data obtained following 0, 4, 13, 20, 30, 50, 88, and 100 weeks of frozen storage showed no significant deviation from zero (p > 0.05) for all individuals tested.  after 100 weeks of storage, the total changes in proliferative activity (counts per minute per week) were -2.1% +/- 16.8% and -5.5% +/- 17.0% for tsst-1 and sea, respectively. the lymphocyte proliferative responses to pokeweed mitogen, concanavalin a, and sonicates of two periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) following frozen storage were similar to those with tsst-1 and sea. these results indicate that peripheral blood mononuclear cells stored frozen may serve as appropriate controls to monitor changes in the disease state long-term periodontal treatment.

TI  == multiplex pcr using conserved and species-specific 16s rrna gene primers for simultaneous detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas  gingivalis.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis are strongly associated with periodontitis. however, little is known about their distribution  in periodontally healthy individuals, because culturing techniques are not sufficiently sensitive. a modified multiplex pcr was developed to address that question. our method uses two species-specific forward primers in combination with a single reverse primer. these primers target variable and conserved regions of the 16s rrna gene. sensitivity was determined by testing serial dilutions of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis cells. primer specificity was tested against (i) six a. actinomycetemcomitans strains and four p. gingivalis strains,  (ii) seven different species of oral bacteria, and (iii) supra- and subgingival plaque from 20 subjects. the multiplex pcr had a lower limit of detection of 2 a. actinomycetemcomitans and 30 p. gingivalis cells. species-specific amplicons were obtained for all a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis strains tested and did not occur with seven other bacterial species unless a. actinomycetemcomitans  and p. gingivalis were added. neither target species was detected in supragingival plaque; a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in one subgingival specimen, and p. gingivalis was detected in another. when plaque samples were spiked with 10 a. actinomycetemcomitans cells and 100 p. gingivalis cells, species-specific amplicons were detected. these findings show our multiplex pcr to be highly sensitive and specific while allowing simultaneous detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis. this assay has potential applications in epidemiological studies, diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin-8 production in mononuclear cells stimulated by oral microorganisms.
AB  == chemokines are a family of low-molecular-weight proinflammatory cytokines that stimulate recruitment of leukocytes. the chemokines interleukin-8 (il-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. chemokine expression contributes to the presence of different leukocyte populations observed in normal and pathologic states. in the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were stimulated by microbes (candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) selected based upon their importance as oral pathogens. il-8 and mcp-1 gene expression and protein release were determined by northern blot (rna blot) analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. c. albicans, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans induced high levels of production of both mcp-1 and il-8. s. mutans was a strong inducer of mcp-1, but it did not stimulate significant production of il-8. c. albicans, s. mutans, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 500 to 5,000 times more potent than p. gingivalis in terms of mcp-1 production. in general, the microbe-to-pbmc ratios required for maximum gene expression of mcp-1 were lower than those for il-8. however, for actual protein release of mcp-1 versus il-8, differences in the effects of various microbe concentrations were observed only for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results demonstrate that different oral pathogens induce specific dose-dependent patterns of chemokine gene expression and release. such patterns may help explain the immunopathology of oral infections, particularly with regard to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-6 and soluble interleukin-6 receptor production.
AB  == to determine the effect of pathogenic oral bacteria on interleukin 6 (il-6) and soluble il-6 receptor production, we measured their release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes (monocyte depleted), pure t cells, or monocytes were cultured with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum or porphyromonas gingivalis for  24 h. supernatants were tested for il-6 and soluble il-6 receptor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. only monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells responded with significant il-6 release in the presence of all  bacteria tested. however, peripheral blood lymphocytes were capable of producing  il-6 when activated by phytohemagglutinin or il-2 followed by bacteria, though substantially less than cultures containing monocytes. no bacteria tested increased soluble il-6 receptor release over spontaneous soluble il-6 receptor release. we conclude that monocytes release il-6 after contact with oral pathogens; however, soluble il-6 receptor from t cells and monocytes is constitutively produced and may modulate il-6 actions.

TI  == immunoglobulin allotypes and immunoglobulin g subclass responses to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in early-onset  periodontitis.

TI  == strong cytotoxicity to human gingival fibroblasts by porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the cytotoxicity of some bacterial species associated with periodontal diseases. the specificity of cytotoxicity was estimated against cells of various origin and from different individuals. the reference bacteria were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. these bacteria were cultured for 24 h in  liquid media and the supernatants were used in cytotoxicity assays. the target cells used were human gingival fibroblasts (gf), dermal fibroblasts (k4), gingival epithelial cells (e) and hela-cells (hela). these cells were exposed at  4 h or 24 h, respectively, to various concentrations of culture supernatants from the selected bacteria. the influence on the viability and metabolism of the cells were estimated quantitatively as increase in neutral red uptake and lactic acid production. growth medium supernatants of p. gingivalis 33277 were strongly cytotoxic to gingival fibroblasts after 24 h incubation, compared to supernatants of p. gingivalis 381 or w 50, a. actinomycetemcomitans or f. nucleatum cultures.  the toxic effect of p. gingivalis 33277 decreased drastically after heat inactivation, which indicates effects of proteins. by adding anti-sera the cytotoxicity of p. gingivalis 33277 could be dose dependently neutralized, which  was not the case when supernatants of a. actino-mycetemcomitans was tested. target cells of epithelial origin did not show increased cytotoxicity to p. gingivalis 33277. the results of the present study strengthen the hypothesis that p. gingivalis remains as a suspect causative key component in periodontal diseases.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare a commercially available dna probe technique with conventional cultural techniques for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. samples from 20 patients with moderate  to severe periodontitis were evaluated at baseline and during a 15 months period  of periodontal treatment. paperpoints from 4 periodontal pockets per patient were forwarded to omnigene for dna probe analysis, and simultaneously inserted paperpoints from the same pockets were analyzed by standard culture techniques. in addition, mixed bacterial samples were constructed harbouring known proportions of 25 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia each. a relatively low concordance was found between both methods. at  baseline a higher detection frequency was found for a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis for the dna probe technique; for p. intermedia the detection frequency by culture was higher. for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 21% of the culture positive samples was positive with the dna probe. testing the constructed bacterial samples with the dna probe method resulted in about 16% false positive  results for the 3 species tested. furthermore, 40% of p. gingivalis strains were  not detected by the dna probe. the present data suggest that at least part of the discrepancies found between the dna probe technique used and cultural methods are caused by false positive and false negative dna probe results. therefore, the value of this dna probe method for the detection of periodontal pathogens is questionable.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of the putative periodontal pathogens prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, the three oral capnocytophaga species (c. ochracea, c. sputigena, c. gingivalis), as well as porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in plaque samples of periodontally healthy individuals. we chose a newly developed 16s rdna directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and a previously described dot-blot hybridization assay to detect, differentiate, and quantify these bacteria directly in clinical samples. the subjects of these investigations were 66 sulcus fluid samples from 17 children (ages 3 to 5) attending a kindergarten, 48 sulcus  fluid samples from 12 children (ages 9 and 10) from a primary school, and 25 subgingival plaque samples isolated from 6 different periodontally healthy dental students (ages 24 to 27). we were able to demonstrate the presence of p. nigrescens in 54 (kindergarten: 5; primary school: 33; students: 16) samples by pcr and quantified it by dot-blot hybridization. in addition, we found c. ochracea in 12 (kindergarten: 2; primary school: 10) samples by pcr reaction only. the other tested bacterial species were absent by the methods used. furthermore we confirmed the specificity of our p. nigrescens-pcr in selected samples by enzyme electrophoresis.

TI  == exploratory case-control analysis of psychosocial factors and adult periodontitis.
AB  == we explored the association between social factors and adult periodontitis by comparing self-reported information for daily strains and symptoms of depression  in 71 cases and 77 controls. cases and controls were selected from among 1,426 participants in the erie county risk factor study. we found differences among those who scored higher than their peers on measures of social strain. the odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) for the association between case  status and role strain score of 2.27 or more was 2.84, 95% ci = 1.08 to 7.46. we  also examined serum antibody, dichotomized at the median, for three periodontal pathogens (bacteroides forsythus [igg bf], porphyromonas gingivalis [igg pg], actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans [igg aa]), and assessed interaction between  antibody levels and a depression score derived from the brief symptom inventory.  igg pg and igg aa were both strongly associated with case status (or = 4.52, 95%  ci = 1.99 to 10.3 and or = 5.29, 95% ci = 2.34 to 12.0, respectively). igg bf was associated with periodontal disease but only among individuals who had higher scores for depression (or = 6.75, 95% ci = 1.25 to 36.5). smoking status was associated with case status (or = 4.95, 95% ci = 1.86 to 13.2). we assessed these findings prospectively by examining factors associated with more extensive disease among the 71 case subjects after 1 year of follow-up. we found baseline smoking status and igg bf among individuals scoring high on depression at baseline to be associated with more extensive disease (8.1% or more of the sites  showing further breakdown). in this population an elevated depression score may be a marker for social isolation, which could play a role in immune function during periods of social strain. this exploratory analysis has served to identify specific lines of inquiry concerning psychosocial measures as important environmental factors in adult periodontitis.

TI  == current view of risk factors for periodontal diseases.
AB  == peridontal diseases are infections, and many forms of the disease are associated  with specific pathogenic bacteria which colonize the subgingival area. at least two of these microorganisms, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, also invade the periodontal tissue and are virulent organisms. initiation and progression of periodontal infections are clearly modified by local and systemic conditions called risk factors. the local factors  include pre-existing disease as evidenced by deep probing depths and plaque retention areas associated with defective restorations. systemic risk factors recently have been identified by large epidemiologic studies using multifactorial statistical analyses to correct for confounding or associated co-risk factors. risk factors which we know today as important include diabetes mellitus, especially in individuals in whom metabolic control is poor, and cigarette smoking. these two risk factors markedly affect the initiation and progression of periodontitis, and attempts to manage these factors are now an important component of prevention and treatment of adult periodontitis. systemic conditions associated with reduced neutrophil numbers or function are also important risk factors in children, juveniles, and young adults. diseases in which neutrophil dysfunction occurs include the lazy leukocyte syndrome associated with localized  juvenile periodontitis, cyclic neutropenia, and congenital neutropenia. recent studies also point to several potentially important periodontal risk indicators.  these include stress and coping behaviors, and osteopenia associated with estrogen deficiency. there are also background determinants associated with periodontal disease including gender (with males having more disease), age (with  more disease seen in the elderly), and hereditary factors. the study of risk in periodontal disease is a rapidly emerging field and much is yet to be learned. however, there are at least two significant risk factors-smoking and diabetes-which demand attention in current management of periodontal disease.

TI  == prostaglandin production via induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to investigate the involvement of cyclooxygenase-1(cox-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) in pge2 production by human  gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodondopathogenic bacteria. lps were isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans)  and eschericia coli (e coli) by the phenol-water procedure. the three lps preparations produced pce2 up to 48 h in a time-dependent manner in human gingival fibroblasts. p. gingivalis-lps was the most potent stimulator of pge2 production and, to a lesser extent, a actinomycetemcomitans- and e coli-lps. treatment of the cells with indomethacin, a non selective cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor and ns-398, a selective cox-2 inhibitor, completely depressed pge2 production. treatment of dexamethasone, known to inhibit cox-2 expression, also significantly prevented pge2 production. immunohistochemical staining of cox-2 protein demonstrated that expression of cox-2 protein was increased at 24 h after p gingivalis-lps stimulation, while expression of cox-1 protein was not affected by p. gingivalis-lps. in order to investigate the regulation of pge2 production. p.  gingivalis-lps-stimulated cells were treated with herbimycin a and genistein, both inhibitors of tyrosine kinases. both the inhibitors significantly inhibited  pge2 production. herbimycin a treatment depressed expression of cox-2 protein. these data suggest that human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lps from periodontopathogenic bacteria mainly produce pge2 not by cox-1, but by cox-2, induction of which may be regulated by tyrosine kinase and that the produced pge2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == serum antibodies to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in juvenile periodontitis and adult periodontitis (part i).
AB  == recent microbiological studies support the concept that specific gram negative bacteria play a major role in the etiology and pathogenesis of human chronic inflammatory periodontal disease. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has been isolated frequently from juvenile periodontitis and porphyromonas gingivalis has  been shown to be a prominent species in adult periodontitis in humans. the purpose of this study was to determine levels of the specific antibodies to a.actinomycetemcomitans and p.gingivalis in 17 patients with juvenile and 15 patients with adult periodontitis and 24 healthy subjects. igg and igm antibody titers against these antigens were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the levels of antibodies against a.actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in the juvenile periodontitis compared to the adult periodontitis patients and controls. anti-p.gingivalis antibodies were elevated in adult periodontitis compared to juvenile periodontitis patients and controls.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens, antibody titres and avidities to them in a longitudinal study of patients with resistant periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to study changes in antibody titres and antibody avidities to putative periodontal pathogens in patients with resistant periodontitis and to compare these findings with the result of culture of these pathogens. subjects and methods: patients meeting strict clinical criteria in whom periodontal therapy had failed to prevent disease progression were studied microbiologically and immunologically over a 75-week period. particular reference was made to the isolation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) together with changes in antibody titres and avidities to these organisms between baseline examination and week 75. results: pg was eliminated following antibiotic treatment but metronidazole and amoxycillin therapy failed to remove aa in all cases. antibody avidities to these pathogens were higher in patients than in matched controls but no change in avidity was noted during the course of treatment. most antibody titres were not significantly higher in patients than in controls. conclusions: continued disease progression characterised these patients who, nevertheless, mounted an immune response to the periodontal pathogens but this appeared to be inadequate to stop the disease.

TI  == [evaluation of non radioactive dna probe (affirm dp) for detecting periodontopathic bacteria].
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the potential of application of non-radioactive dna probe method (affirm dp) in clinical diagnosis and evaluation of treatment efficacy. sensitivity and specificity of two different cut-off levels (10(4), 5 x 10(5)) of the method with bacterial culture in detection of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were compared. those bacteria were obtained from bacterial  cultures and clinical samples from healthy subjects and patients with periodontal disease. the results showed that detection percentage of dna probe method with 10(4) cut-off was equal to or higher than the culture method for bacteroides forsythus and porphyromonas gingivalis detection. therefore, it is suggested to be a useful chairside dna probe kit as an aid in clinical diagnosis and evaluation of treatment efficacy.

TI  == immunomodulatory and superantigen activities of bacteria associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == immune dysfunctions are frequently associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. several investigators have reported that patients with severe periodontitis show  reduced or negligible levels of proliferative responses of peripheral blood and gingival lymphocytes to periodontopathic organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influences of products from porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) on lymphocytes obtained from periodontally diseased and non-diseased individuals  in order to extend our understanding of the possible role of such bacterial components as immune modulators. pooled cultures of either p. gingivalis or a. actinomycetemcomitans were disrupted using glass beads in a bead mill to prepare  whole cell homogenates. these homogenates were then co-cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and known lymphocyte stimulators. cultures were pulsed with tritiated thymidine, harvested, and radio label incorporation was determined. responses to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1)  and pokeweed mitogen (pwm) were inhibited at high concentrations of bacterial homogenate. however, as the concentration was reduced, responses induced by pwm were restored while tsst-1 induced responses remained inhibited. such results suggest that p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans contain potent immunosuppressants with differential influences on lymphocyte population. these effects on b- and t-cells are independent of periodontal disease status and appear to exert their influence through non-toxic mechanisms. in addition, work currently underway presently indicates that obligate oral anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis produce substances with some of the characteristics of superantigens.

TI  == host responses induced by co-infection with porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a murine model.
AB  == in this study, evidence is presented that mixed infection with the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans results in a synergistic effect in their pathogenicity and in their ability to induce humoral and cellular host responses. balb/c mice were injected subcutaneously on the back with p. gingivalis atcc 53977, a. actinomycetemocomitans 75 or a mixture of both bacteria. samples of blood and fluid from abscesses formed at the site of injection (first degree) or distant from the injection site were collected for microbiologic analysis. serum and spleens were obtained for evaluation of humoral and cellular responses to p. gingivalis and a actinomycetemocomitans. mice injected with a. actinomycetemcomitans had first-degree lesions only, whereas mice injected with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans had lesions at first- and second-degree sites from which both bacterial species were isolated. a serum anti-p. gingivalis response was induced in p. gingivalis-injected mice, which was higher in mice injected with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. this pattern was not seen in the anti-a, actinomycetemcomitans response. lymphoproliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and p. gingivalis of spleen cells from infected mice were decreased, especially following co-infection. furthermore, co-infection of mice resulted in the greatest decrease in the number of cd5+, especially cd4+ lymphocytes.

TI  == the relationship of gingival crevicular fluid short chain carboxylic acid concentration to gingival inflammation.
AB  == short-chain carboxylic acids (scca; c < or = 5; e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which accumulate in the gingival crevice, and exhibit significant biological activity,  including the ability to alter gene expression. it has been hypothesized that among the activities of sccas are their ability to contribute to gingival inflammation. this concept complements the notion that specific periodontal pathogens are the causative agents of gingival inflammation. to begin testing these 2 hypotheses, we examined the relationship between scca concentrations, specific putative periodontal pathogens, and gingival inflammation in medically healthy periodontally diseased subjects. we reasoned that if sccas and/or specific periodontal pathogens were causative gingival inflammatory agents, gingival inflammation should increase with increasing concentration of the inflammatory mediator. we also recognized that other clinical variables needed to be controlled for, and an objective quantitative assessment of gingival inflammation used. to accomplish these tasks, sites within subjects were stratified by location and pocket depth, and the following quantified: bacterial  presence; scca concentration; and gingival inflammation. the results indicated that gingival inflammation directly and significantly correlated with scca concentrations in the maxillary and mandibular molars, incisors and canines (all  r > or = 0.47; all p < or = 0.015; too few bicuspids were available for complete  analysis). the relationship between gingival inflammation and scca concentration  was best described by a natural log relationship. gingival inflammation did not,  however, correlate positively with either the total number of specific putative periodontal pathogens, or the sum of subsets of these pathogens (-0.31 < or = r < or = 0.39; 0.08 < or = p < or = 0.75) for any of the locations. finally, the scca concentration did not correlate with the level of individual or groups of pathogens. these data, together with historical work and other preliminary data,  support the hypothesis that scca, rather than specific putative periodontal pathogens, may be a causative agent in gingival inflammation. this work may, in part, begin to explain the apparent lack of a direct relationship between current gingival inflammation and the prediction of bacterially mediated periodontal attachment loss.

TI  == short-term responses to periodontal therapy in insulin-dependent diabetic patients.
AB  == this investigation studied relative changes in periodontal conditions of 18 insulin-dependent diabetic patients. measures of gingival inflammation, crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels, probing depth and attachment levels, the presence of three periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and  serum antibody titers to these bacteria, and blood sugar levels (glycosylated hemoglobin, hbalc) were studied before and 2 months after non-surgical debridement. antibody titers to the same bacteria were also studied in sera from  18 sex- and age-matched periodontally healthy and non-diabetic subjects. periodontal conditions showed significant improvement. the mean probing depth at  4 of the worst sites selected in each patient decreased from 5.7 mm to 4.8 mm (p  < 0.0001). the mean full width probing depth changed from 2.9 mm (s.d. +/- 0.2) to 2.5 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3). a mean gain of 0.4 mm attachment level was recorded (p  < 0.0001). the mean ast value decreased from 1009 microiu to 518 microiu (p < 0.006). minimal differences in mean glycosylated hemoglobin values (hbalc) were noticed before and after treatment. a. actinomycetemcomitans was never detected.  p. gingivalis was present at 7% of the sites both before and after treatment. b.  forsythus was found at 29% of sites (50% of patients) before and at 36% of sites  (61% of patients) after treatment. positive associations were found between the presence of b. forsythus and ast values, gingival index, probing depth, and attachment level (p < 0.05). baseline serum igg titers to p. gingivalis were significantly lower in the patients with diabetes (9.5 elisa units vs. 28.5 elisa units in the healthy controls). igg titers to b. forsythus did not differ between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. no changes in igg titers occurred after treatment. clinical improvements after mechanical non-surgical therapy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were modest after 2 months. treatment did not eliminate b. forsythus and p. gingivalis and did not affect igg titer responses. more intense therapy, and longer follow-up times, may be necessary to see more pronounced clinical and systemic effects.

TI  == osseointegrated implants in patients treated for generalized severe adult periodontitis. an interim report.
AB  == this study presents oral rehabilitation with osseointegrated implants in partially edentulous patients treated for generalized severe adult periodontitis. five female patients aged between 31 and 44 received a total of 36 implants and were observed for 1 year after insertion of the superstructure. three months before implantation, venous blood samples were taken from the patients and five periodontally healthy controls, and the serum examined with highly sensitive elisa test kits for interleukin 1 beta (il-1 beta) and interleukin 6 (il-6). clinical examination covered the plaque index (pi) and gingival index (gi) at teeth and implants plus probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal) at the teeth. microbiological evaluation of teeth and implants was performed by dark-field analysis, and dna analysis was performed in addition 1 year after insertion of the superstructure. radiological controls of the teeth were carried  out with standard single-tooth films in the 2 years preceding implantation and at baseline. following implantation, further controls of the teeth and implants were undertaken immediately after insertion of the superstructure and 1 year thereafter. the immunological examination revealed that the il-1 beta (0.22 +/- 0.2 pg/ml) (means +/- sd) and il-6 (2.27 +/- 2.8 pg/ml) level was slightly, but not significantly, higher in the patients than in the control group (il-1 beta: 0.06 +/- 0.06 pg/ml and il-6: 0.64 +/- 0.2 pg/ml) (p > 0.05). the clinical results show that the gi at the teeth rose slightly from 0.0 to 0.2, and at the implants from 0.3 to 0.4. the pi rose slightly from 0.3 to 0.7 at the teeth and from 0.2 to 0.9 at the implants. neither the gi nor the pi revealed any significant difference between teeth and implants. clinical attachment loss at the teeth was minimal at 4.7 to 4.8 mm. comparison between the teeth and the implants revealed no essential difference in bacterial flora; neither actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans nor porphyromonas gingivalis was recorded at any location. small quantities of prevotella intermedia were detected at the teeth and implants of one patient. radiological evaluation 1 year after insertion of the superstructure revealed a mean bone loss of 0.62 mm at the implants. the bone loss at the teeth during the same period was 0.3%, whereas it had been 1.5%  in each of the 2 previous years. these results suggest that there is only a slight difference between the periodontal and peri-implant areas in patients with generalized severe adult periodontitis. the full potential for implants in these  patients, however, needs to be shown in controlled longitudinal studies.

TI  == the role of endotoxin and cytokines in the pathogenesis of odontogenic cysts.
AB  == odontogenic cysts arise from tooth-forming epithelial residues. the stimulus for  the formation of radicular cysts is thought to be endotoxin released from the infected necrotic tooth pulp. however, in keratocysts and follicular cysts, such  a stimulus is not present. in order to investigate what drives the cyst epithelium to proliferate, explant media and fluids from 16 radicular cysts, eight keratocysts and seven follicular cysts and explant media from four specimens of non-inflamed gingival tissue were examined for the presence of endotoxin and cytokines. cyst fluids were also cultured for 72 h in anaerobic and aerobic conditions to detect micro-organisms. endotoxin from three different bacteria, cytokines [interleukin-(il) 1 alpha, il-1 beta and il-6] as well as prostaglandin e2 (pge2) were tested in an epithelial cell-proliferation assay. as the cyst epithelium is supported by a connective tissue capsule, the effect of fibroblast culture media on epithelial cell proliferation was also investigated.  the results showed significantly higher concentrations of endotoxin in radicular  cyst fluid than in the keratocyst or the follicular cyst. none of the cyst fluids contained micro-organisms. immunoassays demonstrated the presence of il-1 alpha and -6 in all fluids and explants tested; il-1 beta was only found in the inflammatory radicular cysts. however, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that mrnas for il-1 alpha, -1 beta and -6 were present in all cyst types. proliferation studies indicated that endotoxin and the cytokines had  a mitogenic effect on epithelia at low concentrations; pge2 had very little effect at low concentrations, and had an inhibitory effect at high concentrations. cyst fibroblast culture media had a mitogenic effect on the epithelia that was enhanced by the presence of endotoxin.

TI  == source of suspected periodontal pathogens re-emerging after periodontal treatment.
AB  == to clarify the source of re-emerging periodontal pathogens after treatment, we compared the ribotypes of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group and campylobacter rectus before and after treatment in 7 periodontitis patients and in 6 of the spouses. the patients harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group or c. rectus in their subgingival or salivary samples before treatment. the respective bacterial species were not detected 1 month after treatment, but reappeared by 6 months later. when available, 4 random colonies of each of the 4 species were isolated from both subgingival and salivary samples at each sampling occasion, the isolates were subcultured, identified and typed applying pheno- and genotypic intraspecies characterization  methods. altogether 90 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group and c. rectus were available from 2, 3, 2 and 4 patients, respectively. the pre- and post-treatment ribotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans-, p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group-isolates were identical in all respective patients. the pre- and post-treatment ribotypes of c. rectus were identical in 1 of 4 patients, whereas  2 patients harbored a previously not detected post-treatment ribotype and 1 patient harbored the initial and a previously not detected post-treatment ribotype. to study the possibility that periodontitis patients may acquire strains from the spouse after treatment, isolates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group and c. rectus (n = 95) from the patients' spouses were ribotyped and compared with those of the patients. the patient exhibited his own post-treatment ribotypes, different from those of the spouse, of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis in 1 couple and of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group and c. rectus in 1 couple. in the 2 patients who harbored a previously not detected post-treatment ribotype of c. rectus, one patient shared the new ribotype with the spouse, whereas the other one did not. although an exogenous source cannot be fully ruled out, the patient's own oral flora seems to be the main source of re-emerging periodontal pathogens after treatment.

TI  == value of some laboratory and clinical measurements in the treatment plan for advanced periodontitis.
AB  == in our previous study, we reported that only 13 of 46 adult patients with advanced periodontitis responded well to initial non-surgical periodontal therapy. in the present follow-up study, the remaining 33 patients were randomly  treated further using either modified widman flap surgery or systemic metronidazole. the patients responding unsatisfactorily to this 2nd treatment phase, received supplementary systemic chemotherapy or surgery, respectively. by  using this study design, we determined which baseline clinical variables and/or laboratory findings predicted the treatment outcome in these study patients. clinical variables included the assessment of bleeding, suppuration, probing pocket depth, furcation lesions, relative attachment level and radiographic infrabony defects. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were cultured from subgingival plaque samples. the specific igg and iga antibody levels against 5 serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans were determined in serum and saliva. elastase-like, trypsin-like and general protease  activities were assessed from saliva. the bivariate statistical analyses showed that the most pronounced difference between the patients responding well to initial non-surgical therapy (group mc, n = 13), to either supplementary surgery  or chemotherapy (group ft1, n = 11), or those responding to the complex therapy (group ft2, n = 17), was the prior extent of periodontal destruction expressed as the proportion of > or = 6 mm deep periodontal pockets. when multiple linear regression was used to investigate the influence of clinical and laboratory findings on the variation of treatment response between the 3 groups, the most significant explanatory factor was the simultaneous presence of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans and multiple deep periodontal pockets. none of the immunological or biochemical variables used had any further influence in the model. pretreatment microbiological examination, especially for the detection of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, seems to be a valuable laboratory screening method for  identifying complex treatment need in adult patients with advanced periodontitis. however, the evaluation of the extent and pattern of periodontal breakdown remains crucial for choosing the treatment strategy including surgery and/or chemotherapy in a. actinomycetemcomitans-infected adult periodontitis patients.

AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of cyclosporine a (csa) on the inflammatory lesion formed in the gingival tissues during de novo plaque formation. 5 beagle dogs were used. on day 0, all teeth of the 5 dogs were scaled and polished. a 6-week period of plaque control including daily tooth cleaning with toothbrush and dentifrice was initiated. a clinical examination regarding plaque and gingivitis was performed, and the plaque control measures were abandoned on the right side of mandible. 3 weeks later, the clinical examination was repeated, samples of subgingival plaque harvested and biopsies obtained from the 3rd and 4th right mandibular premolar regions. the tooth cleaning measures on the left side of the mandible were terminated at this interval. during the following 3 weeks, the animals formed plaque in the lower left premolar regions, and received, 1 x daily, a subcutaneous injection of csa.  at the end of this 2nd plaque formation period (test), the clinical examination was repeated, subgingival plaque was sampled and biopsies from the 3rd and 4th left mandibular premolar regions harvested. the biopsies were prepared for histometric and morphometric analyses. the clinical and histological examinations demonstrated that plaque formation resulted in a gingival lesion (ict) which, in  the 2 periods, had similar size and apical extension. the ict formed during the csa administration period, however, harbored an increased number of plasma cells  and a reduced macrophage density than the control lesion. it is suggested that csa administration may result in a th-2 (t-helper 2-cell) dependent activation of b-lymphocytes.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the clinical effect of treatment aimed to suppress actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis below  detection level and prevotella intermedia below 5% of the cultivable periodontal  pocket flora. sixteen patients and a total of 111 periodontal pockets with probing depth > or = 6 mm were included in the study. twelve patients and a total of 77 sites completed the 5-year study. the results demonstrated clinical improvement of probing depth and gain of clinical attachment level of 3.4 mm and  1.2 mm, respectively. treatment to eliminate indicator bacteria continued for 3 years before the aim was fulfilled. in order to eliminate a. actinomycetemcomitans from a majority of the sites, a combination of surgery and  generalized tetracycline treatment was performed. a recolonization or regrowth of the indicator bacteria exceeding detection levels took place in several sites. the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia, alone or in combination, correlated with attachment level change on the individual level. no such correlation was obtained by using presence of plaque, bleeding on  probing, or three other bacteria (campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and  fusobacterium nucleatum) not used as treatment goal markers.

TI  == lipopolysaccharides from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans promote osteoclastic differentiation in vitro.
AB  == bacterial lipopolysaccharides possess bone-resorbing activity. here, lipopolysaccharides from three putative periodontopathic bacteria were examined for effects on osteoclast-like cell formation of bone marrow cells from lipopolysaccharide-responsive c3h-hen and non-responsive c3h/hej mice. the bone marrow cells were cultured with or without various doses of lipopolysaccharide in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 and dexamethasone. these lipopolysaccharide preparations significantly increased the number of osteoclast-like cells formed in the culture of c3h/hen marrow cells; the same as  lipopolysaccharides from escherichia coli and a synthetic lipid a with e. coli-type structure (la-15-pp), at doses from 0.1 to 1 microgram/ml. this stimulating effect of each lipopolysaccharides was uniformly abrogated by the addition of polymyxin b at 5 micrograms/ml. all the lipopolysaccharide and the synthetic lipid a had no effect on osteoclast formation of the c3h/hej marrow cells, whereas lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia showed significant mitogenic activity on c3h/hej spleen cells. it seems likely that the activity of lipopolysaccharides to augment osteoclast-like  cell formation in the bone marrow cell cultures is derived from a common structure of the lipid a portion.

TI  == colonization by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in adult periodontitis patients as detected by the antibody-based evalusite test.
AB  == studies were performed to evaluate the detection of disease-associated bacterial  colonization in adult periodontitis patients by the antibody-based evalusite testtm (eastman kodak company). the association of test results with disease was  assessed by collecting 104 duplicate subgingival plaque samples from 26 patients. samples were tested for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia using both microbiological culture and the immunoassay test. the sensitivity and specificity of the 2 methods was calculated using %s of positive results in deep periodontal pockets and negative results in  shallow subgingival sites. a cutoff >10(4) cultivable counts yielded the greatest discrimination between health and disease on a cross-sectional basis and established this threshold as clinically relevant for the detection of disease-associated levels of bacterial colonization by these three microorganisms. the clinical detection limit of the immunoassay test was observed to coincide with this threshold of >10(4) cultivable counts. microbiological testing of the 4 deepest pockets using the immunoassay test was determined to be  sufficient to yield a 90% confidence of detecting positive patients in a study with 59 adult subjects. the immunoassay test method was also demonstrated to be effective at detecting bacterial colonization in sets of paper point samples that were pooled for analysis. an overall agreement of 94% (288 of 306) was observed when comparing test results for duplicate sets of pooled and individual samples collected from 51 patients. these studies demonstrate that the evalusite test is  an effective method for detecting clinically relevant colonization by the test bacteria in patients at risk for periodontal disease.

TI  == analytical performance of an immunologic-based periodontal bacterial test for simultaneous detection and differentiation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == the analytical performance of a membrane-based immunoassay for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia (including prevotella nigrescens) was investigated. positive reactions were observed for 71 of 71 reference strains and recent oral isolates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia. no cross-reactivity was observed with 39 other common oral and environmental species. the specificity of the test was unaffected by the presence of potential oral interferents including whole blood, white blood cells, mucin, saliva, toothpastes, and oral rinses. a proficiency test by dental  professionals using a standardized set of unknown simulated samples yielded a sensitivity of 97% (116/120) and a 100% specificity (240/ 240). an additional group including dental professionals and high school students was shown to be 99% proficient (1385/1397) in distinguishing proper from improper test function when  processing control samples with normal test devices and devices with simulated error conditions. comparisons to a culture standard for 104 subgingival plaque samples collected from 26 adult periodontitis patients yielded > 98% specificity  for each of the test bacteria. in addition, the detection threshold for the test  was determined to be equivalent to 10(4) cultivable test bacteria when compared to the culture standard. the data indicate that this membrane immunoassay is a valid and easy-to-use method for the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia in subgingival plaque, at levels above the detection threshold of the test.

TI  == the effect of periodontal treatment on periodontal bacteria on the oral mucous membranes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of conventional periodontal treatment on the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia on oral mucous membranes in patients with periodontitis. fifteen patients were selected with moderate to severe periodontitis (mean age: 39.8 years, range: 26 to 58). from each patient the 4 deepest sites with bleeding on probing were selected for clinical and microbiological evaluation. at baseline, 6 weeks after oral hygiene instruction and extensive scaling and root planing, and 3 months after periodontal surgery, clinical parameters and microbiological samples including saliva, oral mucous membranes, and supra- and subgingival plaque were evaluated for the presence of the 3 test bacteria using indirect immunofluorescence. all clinical variables, except redness, showed a significant improvement after surgery. after treatment,  the subgingival prevalence of the 3 putative periodontal pathogens had decreased  significantly. however, almost no concomitant reduction in the prevalence of the  bacteria was seen on the oral mucous membranes. this suggests that the oral mucous membranes may serve as a source for reinfection of the periodontium after  treatment.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == [typing and transmission of periodontal bacteria].
AB  == an overview is given of typing methods for bacteria that are associated with periodontitis. special attention is paid to new molecular biological techniques,  based on the characterization of protein and dna. bacteria that are associated with periodontitis have a population structure similar to that of opportunistic bacteria. typing methods are used to study transmission of bacteria. p. gingivalis can be transmitted between spouses, but transmission from parent to child seems to be uncommon. a. actinomycetemcomitans transmission between adults  does not occur frequently, while transmission from parent to child can occur in a low frequency.

TI  == the effect of age on the development of gingivitis. clinical, microbiological and histological findings.
AB  == in the present "experimental gingivitis" study, the response of the marginal gingiva to plaque formation was studied in one group of young subjects, 20-25 years of age, and in one group of older subjects, aged 65-80 years. during a 4-week period, all subjects received a series of professional tooth cleaning to establish healthy gingival conditions. a baseline examination (day 0) included assessments of plaque and gingivitis. sites that were examined (the experimental  sites) included the mesio-palatal, palatal, and disto-palatal surfaces of all teeth present in the 15 ... 25 tooth region. among the experimental sites, microbial sampling and gingival fluid assessment were performed and one gingival  biopsy harvested from each subject. following the baseline examination, the participants abolished mechanical tooth cleaning measures in the palatal and approximal surfaces of 15 ... 25. the clinical examination and the gingival fluid measurement were repeated on days 7, 14 and 21 of no oral hygiene. the microbiological sampling and the biopsy procedure were repeated on days 7 and 21. the data collected demonstrated that old subjects, during a 3-week period of oral hygiene abstention, formed similar amounts of plaque as the young subjects, but developed more gingivitis than young subjects. thus, the clinical gingivitis assessments, the gingival fluid measurements and morphometric determinations made in the biopsy samples documented that the gingival lesion which formed in the old individuals was more pronounced and contained more inflammatory cells than the corresponding lesion in the young subject sample.

TI  == utility of 5 major putative periodontal pathogens and selected clinical parameters to predict periodontal breakdown in patients on maintenance care.
AB  == the predictive utility of 5 major putative periodontopathic microbial species, "superinfecting" organisms, and several clinical periodontal parameters were assessed relative to periodontitis recurrence over a 12-month period in 78 treated adult patients participating in a 3-month maintenance care program. at baseline, pooled subgingival microbial samples were collected from each patient,  and whole-mouth evaluations of probing depth, relative periodontal attachment level, furcation involvement, and indices of plaque and gingival inflammation were carried out. 67 (85.9%) subjects were culture-positive at baseline for presence of either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus or peptostreptococcus micros, with 48 (61.5%) subjects yielding one or more of these species at or above designated threshold proportions of > or = 0.01% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, > or = 0.1% for p. gingivalis, > or = 2.5% for p. intermedia, > or = 2.0% for c. rectus, and > or = 3.0% for p. micros. subgingival yeasts were recovered from 12 subjects, staphylococci from 7, and enteric rods/pseudomonads from 6; however, no subjects revealed > or = 1.0% baseline proportions of these "superinfecting" organisms in subgingival specimens. periodontitis recurrence in subjects was defined as any periodontal site exhibiting either a probing depth increase of > or = 3 mm from baseline, or a probing depth increase of > or = 2 mm from baseline together with a loss in relative periodontal attachment of > or = 2 mm from baseline. 15 (19.2%) study subjects showed periodontitis recurrence within 6 months of baseline, and 25 (32.1%) within 12 months. the mere baseline presence of the 5 major test species  and "superinfecting" organisms were not significant predictors of periodontitis recurrence over 12 months. however, a 2.5 relative risk for periodontitis recurrence over 12 months was found for subjects yielding one or more of the 5 major test species at or above the designated baseline threshold proportions (p = 0.022, mantel-haenszel chi 2 test). the positive predictive value for periodontitis recurrence of a microbiologic analysis encompassing the 5 major test species at or above the designated threshold proportions improved with increasing time from baseline, up to approximately 42% at 12 months. baseline variables jointly providing in multiple regression analysis the best predictive capability for periodontitis recurrence in subjects over a 12-month period were recovery of one or more of the 5 major test species at or above designated threshold proportions, the proportion of sites per subject with > or = 5 mm probing depth, and the mean whole-mouth probing depth. these findings indicate that one or more of 5 major putative periodontal pathogens in elevated subgingival proportions together with increased probing depth predispose adults on maintenance care to recurrent periodontitis.

TI  == response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and b. forsythus.
AB  == in a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in  each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for  their content of 14 subgingival species including p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia and b. forsythus using dna probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species  group. because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. however, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed  minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. low test species subjects receiving augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. the mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. high test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving augmentin (14.1). periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with  augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. the greatest proportion of  gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in c. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. in contrast, augmentin appeared to be effective  in decreasing the % sites colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by c. ochracea. knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for  periodontal therapy.

TI  == host defensive functions in a family manifesting early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == family case studies help us identify host risk factors in periodontal disease. in this study we examine a family consisting of a mother (40 years old, with rapidly progressive periodontitis), her elder daughter (14 years old, with localized juvenile periodontitis), and younger daughter (13 years old, with simple gingivitis). we examined 1) the peripheral neutrophil functions (chemotactic migration, phagocytosis, superoxide production); 2) lymphocyte functions (proliferative activity and cytokine productivity of t cells, immunoglobulin [ig] m productivity of b cells when stimulated with pokeweed mitogen); 3) phenotypic analyses of peripheral lymphocyte subpopulations; 4) serum igg antibody titers against periodontopathic bacteria; and 5) serological type of hla class ii. all the subjects exhibited high t4/t8 ratios due to high percentage of cd4-positive cells, showed high igg titers to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and had a  hla dqw1 in common. the mother showed a slight deficiency of neutrophil chemotactic migration to n-formyl methyonyl leucyl phenylalanin (fmlp), raised interleukin-2 productivity of t cell, and high levels of igg titers to porphyromonus gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. both daughters showed weak  t cell proliferative response to anti-cd3 monoclonal antibody and low igm productivity. low lymphocyte responsiveness may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease of these daughters; therefore, the lymphocyte dysfunctions shown should be considered in relation to the progression of periodontal disease.

TI  == immunological, genetic, and microbiological study of family members manifesting early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == from the standpoint of host-parasite interactions, family studies help us understand the host defensive factors and the molecular mechanisms involved in the periodontal immune response. in this study, we report the immunological profile of host-defensive functions, human leukocyte antigen (hla) phenotypes, and the microflora of a mother (rapidly progressive periodontitis), an older son  (periodontally healthy), a younger son (localized juvenile periodontitis), and a  daughter (localized juvenile periodontitis). we examined the peripheral neutrophil functions, phenotypic and functional analysis of peripheral lymphocytes, serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody titers against periodontopathic bacteria, serological type of hla class ii antigens, and bacterial flora in all periodontal pockets. the results showed that actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was dominant in the pockets of all subjects. the mother and two sons showed a depressed neutrophil chemotaxis to n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. all subjects except the older son exhibited low t4/t8 ratios. the mother and daughter had raised levels of igg titers to porphyromonas gingivalis. all subjects had hla phenotypes of drw52 and  dq1 in common. we found that the family members had similar disorders in certain  defensive functions. this family has been a model for our understanding of the host defensive factors in the development of early-onset periodontitis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. in the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt a gene of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp a gene of treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. these gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the pcr assays. primers for p. gingivalis detected p. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of capnocytophaga, 3 species of prevotella, 2 species of porphyromonas other than p. gingivalis, bacteroides levii, escherichia coli, 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of t. denticola. pcr analysis using primers for the lkt a gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. primers selected from the tdp a gene of t. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except t. denticola serovars a, b, and c. thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either p. gingivalis (33277), a. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717  and 43718) or t. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). the pcr assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of a single episode of scaling and root planing on clinical periodontal parameters and on the subgingival microflora in human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-positive and hiv-negative subjects. 13 subjects participated and were clinically scored at days -7, 7, 30 and 90. 7 subjects were infected with hiv and presented an hiv-associated gingivitis. 6 subjects were hiv-negative with at least 12 teeth affected by conventional gingivitis. no significant differences were seen between both groups regarding the presence of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans. the mean plaque index (pli) was 1.79 in the hiv-negative and 1.29 in the hiv-positive group. the mean gingival index (gi) was higher in the hiv-positive group (hiv-positive: 1.55; hiv-negative: 1.47). whereas, the pli decreased significantly in the hiv-negative group during the course of the study, no change was observed in the hiv-positive group. gi as well as bleeding upon sampling decreased significantly in both patient groups during the same period. the bacterial counts decreased from day -7 to day 7 and generally remained on a lower level until day 90. small differences were seen in the microbiological flora of the hiv-positive and the hiv-negative subjects following mechanical treatment.

TI  == prevalence of 6 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from romanian adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to determine by standard cultivation procedures  the detection frequencies of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and capnocytophaga species as well as various enteric rods in subgingival plaque samples form romanian adult periodontitis patients. dna probe  analysis (affirm dp microbial identification test) was also used, parallel to cultivation, to identify p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus, in deep (> or = 6 mm) and intermediate (4-5 mm) pockets in some of the subjects investigated. paper points were used to sample 86 deep pockets in 36 patients and 27 intermediate pockets in 9 of the 36 patients. the chi 2 test was  used to test for significance of differences between results obtained by cultivation and dna analysis in both intermediate and deep pockets. p. gingivalis was recovered in a high percentage of the patients (75.8%) and sites (63.6%) examined, followed by p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans,  respectively. capnocytophaga species were present in almost all subjects. enteric rods were recovered in 61.1% of the patients and 55.8% of the sites. except for this high prevalence of enteric rods, the present group of patients had the periodontal species monitored in %s similar to those commonly perceived in the west. the affirm dp test and cultivation showed poor correlation in detecting p.  gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus. the cultivation prevalence of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in deep pockets was similar to their prevalence in intermediate ones. overall, the prevalence of the periodontal pathogens investigated in the present romanian periodontitis patients is similar  to what has been revealed in matching norwegian and other western periodontitis patient populations. the high prevalence of enteric rods in the romanian patients may have been an artifact resulting from prolonged transport of the samples in vmga iii.

AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis  and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque in 24 juvenile periodontitis patients was determined using dna probe. 36 samples of subgingival plaque from 36 pockets having > or = 6 mm depth, > or = 3 mm of loss of attachment, and bleeding on probing and/or suppuration were taken from 18 patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp, age range 12-24 years); and 12 samples from 6 patients with generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp, age range 23-26 years). as control, an equal numbers of samples from healthy sites in the same patients were studied. p. gingivalis was found in 17 of 18 ljp patients, and in 31 of 36 diseased sites in  those patients. p. intermedia was found in 15 out of the 18 ljp patients and in 28 of the 36 diseased sites. a. actinomycetemcomitans was present in 7 of the 18  ljp patients, and in 9 of the 36 diseased sites, and was not found in any gjp patients. all gjp patients had p. gingivalis (11 out of 12 diseased sites) and p. intermedia (all of the diseased sites). none of the three bacterial species was detected in healthy sites of gjp patients, and were found in healthy sites in only 2 of 18 ljp patients. the high prevalence and high levels of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia found in the ljp and gjp patients studied, suggest that there are populations affected by juvenile periodontitis in which this type of periodontitis is more associated with these species than with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == comparison of the pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulating activity of the surface-associated proteins of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == saline extraction of the periodontopathic bacterium, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, releases surface-associated material (sam), a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates with potent biological actions on isolated  bone and on various mammalian cell populations. in this study, the relative ability of the sam from 5 organisms, implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, to stimulate human mesenchymal and myelomonocytic cells to synthesize the proinflammatory cytokines - interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6 and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha has been investigated. the bacteria investigated were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus. human cells were exposed to a four log order range of concentrations of the sam, or of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, to provide full agonist dose responses in order to allow comparison of the potency and efficacy of each sam. all sams demonstrated the capacity to stimulate human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) or the myelomonocytic cell line - mono-mac-6 to release one or all of the cytokines assayed. activity was heat- and trypsin-sensitive suggesting that the active components were proteinaceous. however, there were substantial differences in the potency and efficacy of each sam when compared on  a concentration basis (w/v). the most active sam was from a. actinomycetemcomitans with those from e. corrodens and p. gingivalis being slightly less active. the least active cytokine-stimulating sams were from c. rectus and pr. intermedia. one major difference between the sams and e. coli lps  was the inability of the former to stimulate hgfs to release il-1 beta or tnf alpha although they could stimulate pbmcs to release these cytokines. this may have relevance to the pathology of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == repopulation of periodontal pockets by microbial pathogens in the absence of supportive therapy.
AB  == this clinical study evaluated the reinfection incidence by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and prevotella intermedia (pi) in periodontal pockets following scaling and root planing (srp) and intra-pocket irrigation with antimicrobial agents in a patient population who did not receive supportive maintenance therapy. the number of target organisms was determined utilizing dna probes. forty-one (41) inflamed pockets > or = 5 mm  with attachment loss and containing at least one target species were selected in  6 adult patients. following a baseline clinical and bacterial examination, all patients received thorough srp. in addition, 1 to 2 teeth in each patient were randomly assigned to each of the following 4 treatment modalities: 1) control group, no irrigation; 2) saline group, irrigation with 2 cc of 0.85% saline; 3) tetracycline group, irrigation with 2 cc of aqueous tetracycline hcl, 50 mg/ml (5%); and 4) chlorhexidine group, irrigation with 2 cc, respectively. all selected sites were non-adjacent. no additional therapy was rendered during the entire 1-year observation period. clinical parameters and microbial analyses were recorded again at 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-treatment. the effect of antimicrobial irrigation on the reinfection rate of sites by aa, pg, and pi was compared with that of the control groups (1 and 2) by anova. no statistically significant differences were observed among the irrigation treatment groups with regard to any of the clinical or bacterial parameters studied. therefore, the 4 treatment groups were combined into a single group whereby the rate of bacterial repopulation following extensive scaling and root planing could be ascertained. the infection incidence of sites at baseline (of total sites), 1 week and 12 months (of sites originally infected at baseline) was 14/41, 3/14, and 7/14 for aa; 33/41, 6/33, and 12/33 for pg; and 37/41, 3/37, and 12/37 for pi, respectively. thus, half or fewer of the originally infected sites  became reinfected at 12 months despite lack of maintenance therapy. the results suggest that 1) a single episode of pocket irrigation with antimicrobial agents following thorough scaling and root planing did not affect the rate of repopulation of periodontal pockets by the tested pathogens; 2) thorough scaling  and root planing has a lasting suppressive effect on selected periodontal pathogens for the majority of sites in patients with adult periodontitis; 3) pre-operative probing depth, the amount of gingival fluid flow and the composition of the subgingival microflora may serve as predictors for reinfection in the absence of maintenance care; and 4) reinfection of the treated sites by aa, pg, and/or pi may constitute a risk factor that diminishes the effect of therapy in the absence of supportive maintenance care.

TI  == immunohistological characteristics of periodontal lesions associated with porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans infections.
AB  == in this study, various phenotypes of infiltrating cells in the periodontium adjacent to pockets harboring porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were evaluated. furthermore, the pattern of class ii antigen expression in the periodontal tissues was determined. eight lesions were  associated with the presence of p. gingivalis and 12 with a. actinomycetemcomitans. predominant cells in the inflammatory infiltrate were t- and b-cells. in most biopsies t-cells dominated over b-cells. the proportion of p. gingivalis, but not of a. actinomycetemcomitans, was positively correlated to  the total number of infiltrating cells in the tissue. a. actinomycetemcomitans sites demonstrated somewhat lower proportions of cd3+, cd4+ and cd19+ cells than  p. gingivalis sites. however, the tendency of decreasing cd4+/cd8+ ratio with increasing number of a. actinomycetemcomitans indicates a local imbalance in immunoregulation. the frequency of class ii antigen expression of both mononuclear and epithelial cells, a sign of immunological activation, was generally high.

TI  == bactericidal effect of erbium yag laser on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: recently erbium (er) yag laser has been developed for dentistry. it may be suitable for periodontal therapy. this study examined the bactericidal effect of the er: yag laser on periodontopathic bacteria in vitro. study design/materials and methods: after spreading the bacterial suspension of porphyromonas gingivalis or actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans on agar plates,  a single pulse laser was applied to the agar plates at the energy density of 0.04-2.6 j/cm2. the growth of the bacterial colonies on the lased agar plates was examined after anaerobic culture. p. gingivalis colonies were also individually exposed to the single pulse laser at the energy of 1.8-10.6 j/cm2. the colony forming units of the irradiated colonies were counted. results: growth inhibitory zones were found at the irradiated sites at the energy of about 0.3 j/cm2 and higher. the survival ratios of the viable bacteria in the lased p. gingivalis colonies decreased significantly at the energy of 7.1 and 10.6 j/cm2, as compared with that of the control. conclusion: these findings suggest that the er:yag laser has a high bactericidal potential at a low energy level.

TI  == the composition of subgingival microflora in two groups of children with and without primary dentition alveolar bone loss.
AB  == the is study examined the relationships between the microbial composition of the  subgingival plaque, contact loss caused by caries and alveolar bone loss (abl) in primary molars. the study included 10 children with contact loss in at least two  sites, one with abl and one without abl, and 10 children without abl with sites with or without contact loss. the microbial composition of subgingival plaque was examined by dark-field microscopy and by cultures of total anaerobic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg). dark-field microscopy confirmed that spirochetes and motile rods may be part of the indigenous flora of the oral cavity. more spirochetes and motile rods were observed in sites with abl than in control sites in the same subject and control  subjects without abl. lower numbers of cocci were seen in sites with abl than in  sites in children without abl, but a significant difference was not observed between sites with abl and healthy sites within the same subjects. no significant differences in the dark-field values were evident in sites without abl, with or without contact loss. aa and pg were found in children and sites with or without  abl. in sites with aa, larger proportions of spirochetes, lower values of cocci,  and more colonies of pg were evident. no significant differences in anaerobic bacteria were evident between sites with or without contact loss or with or without abl. abl in the primary dentition was found to be related to the microbial composition of the subgingival plaque, but not related to contact loss  per se.

TI  == early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == the group of periodontal diseases known as the early-onset periodontal diseases are defined by the age of onset of periodontal destruction, distribution of lesions, association of disease with specific microbial infections, and identification of characteristic alterations, in the host response. significant progress has recently been made in our understanding of the etiology of juvenile  and rapidly progressive periodontitis. considerable evidence points to a familial pattern of disease; both localized and generalized forms of disease may be observed in the same family. the exact mode of inheritance remains unclear, and disease may be the result of a complex interplay between genetically determined alterations of the host response and a specific bacterial challenge. both neutrophil function and immunoglobulin response are altered and appear to be characteristic of an immunologic hyperresponsiveness. bacterial colonization by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (serotype b) and/or porphyromonas gingivalis appears to be the primary initiator of disease. evidence suggests that lesion distribution may be a function of the nature of the infecting agent and the characteristics of the immune response.

TI  == new insights into mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis in periodontitis.
AB  == this review focuses on two topics that in the past decade have significantly enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms by which bacteria produce disease in humans: population structures of bacterial pathogens and tactics used by these bacteria to gain entry to mammalian cells. studies in these areas have identified a number of virulence factors of some medically important pathogens. very recent  applications of this knowledge in efforts to understand mechanisms by which the most extensively studied "putative" periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, may contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontitis are presented. knowledge of the population structures of these periodontopathic bacterial species and the mechanisms used by these bacteria to subvert host cell communication systems and functions will shape future approaches to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == periodontal healing and periopathogenic microflora in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to monitor the clinical and microbiological effects of non-surgical therapy in smokers and non-smokers. the subject material  included 32 patients (age range 32-61 years), 11 men and 21 women with moderate to severe periodontitis. 17 patients were smokers ( > or = 15 cigarettes/day) and 15 non-smokers. all patients were subjected to non-surgical periodontal therapy performed by a dental hygienist. periodontal variables (plaque index, gingival index and probing depth) were registered and bacterial samples were collected before and 2 months after treatment. the treatment resulted in significant reductions towards very low plaque and gingival indices in smokers and non-smokers alike (p < 0.05). although probing depth was reduced in both smokers  and non-smokers, the probing pocket depth reduction was significantly smaller in  smokers than non-smokers (p < 0.05). microbiologically, the same therapeutical efficacy was attained in both smoking groups, indicating an almost total eradication of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis. concerning prevotella intermedia, out of 14 smokers and 10 non-smokers positive at baseline, 9 and 5, respectively, remained positive after treatment. the results suggest a less favourable clinical outcome of non-surgical therapy in smokers than non-smokers in spite of the fact that the therapy was equally effective with regard to reducing the alleged periopathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia.

TI  == colorimetric microtiter plate based assay for detection and quantification of amplified actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans dna.
AB  == we developed a colorimetric microtiter plate-based assay for the detection and quantification of polymerase chain reaction-amplified dna fragment specific for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. we amplified the 396-bp leukotoxin-specific dna fragment by using two oligonucleotide primers, one carrying a biotin group at the 5' end and another one with a digoxigenin at the 5' end. following amplification, the biotinylated polymerase chain reaction products were applied to a microtiter well precoated with avidin. the colorimetric detection and quantification were achieved by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody. the detection limit of the colorimetric assay was found to be as little as 500 fg of purified a. actinomycetemcomitans dna and as few as 50 a. actinomycetemcomitans. therefore, this colorimetric assay was able to estimate the amount of a. actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples. we concluded that the colorimetric assay of the pcr product is a very useful method not only to detect  the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans but also to quantify the amount of a. actinomycetemcomitans in large numbers of subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == viability of four putative periodontal pathogens and enteric rods in the anaerobic transport medium vmga iii.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the survival in vmga iii of porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods in laboratory cultures as well as in subgingival plaque samples. laboratory strains of the 4 putative periodontal pathogens and escherichia coli were used in the laboratory part of this study. also, 31 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 22 periodontal patients and stored in vmga iii. each sample, from both the laboratory and the clinical parts, was divided into 3 portions. one portion was cultured within a few hours of collection (baseline), while the second was processed after 24 h (day 2) and the third 48 h later (day 3). the results of the clinical part indicate that the  detection frequencies of all 4 periodontal pathogens and their levels in positive samples decreased, to different degrees, by day 2 and decreased further by day 3. enteric rods were not detected in base line samples. however, they were present in 16.1% and 22.6% of day 2 and day 3 samples, respectively. similarly, the laboratory results demonstrate a significant decrease in the levels of the 4 periodontal pathogens tested by day 2 and day 3, whereas the opposite occurred for e. coli. p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum survived better in the presence of e. coli than alone, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans survived less well when co-inoculated with e. coli. vmga iii appears to maintain microbial population ratios for periods up to 24 h. after 24 h, the multiplication of enteric organisms may alter the original proportions of the sample.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens colonizing oral mucous membranes in denture-wearing subjects with a past history of periodontitis.
AB  == the prevalence of selected putative periodontal pathogens colonizing oral mucous  membranes was investigated in 26 denture-wearing subjects with a history of periodontitis. the microbiota of the oral cavity of these subjects was examined on average 9.3 years after extraction (range: 1-40 years). samples were taken from several locations on the oral mucous membranes, from saliva and from plaque  attached to the upper and lower denture. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the 26 edentulous subjects. porphyromonas gingivalis was detected in 2 subjects (proportion of cultivable flora: 0.002% and 12.5%). prevotella intermedia was recovered from 7 subjects with a mean proportion of 0.5% (range < 0.001%-6.3%). analysis showed that subjects harbouring p. intermedia were wearing full dentures for a longer period of time (mean: 20.2 years) than subjects in which p. intermedia could not be detected (mean: 6.6 years). this result suggests that the absence of p. intermedia shortly after extraction may reflect only a temporary event. other prevotella species were found in 22 subjects, constituting < 2% of the total cultivable flora (range 0.01%-10.5%). in conclusion, the low prevalence of p. gingivalis and the absence  of a. actinomycetemcomitans, suggest that the oral cavity of edentulous subjects  may not be regarded as a habitat for these species. the preferable habitat of the prevotella spp. seems to be the oral mucous membranes, possibly with the exception of p. intermedia.

TI  == simultaneous detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas  gingivalis by a rapid pcr method.
AB  == the identification of periodontal pathogens by conventional methods is time-consuming and difficult. therefore, a multiplex pcr method for simultaneous  detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) was developed for rapid and easy determination of these risk-indicator bacteria in human periodontal disease. the pcr primers were designed to hybridize to various regions of 16s rrna genes, and a hot-start technique was used to obtain maximum sensitivity and specificity. this method can detect both of these bacteria in subgingival plaque samples at concentrations as  low as 5 to 50 cells per sample. the sensitivity, however, was even 10 times better when the bacteria were analyzed in a water suspension. since the only step between sample collection and the actual analysis is a brief centrifugation of the patient sample, the detection can be readily carried out in four hours. the performance of the method was studied with 36 patient samples. the results showed that the pcr method detected a.a. (44% vs. 25%, respectively) and p.g. (56% vs. 42%, respectively) more often than the conventional culture in plaque samples. thus, our multiplex pcr method is rapid and more effective than conventional protocols in detecting these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == salivary levels of suspected periodontal pathogens in relation to periodontal status and treatment.
AB  == the primary ecological niche for suspected periodontal pathogens seems to be the  subgingival area, even though periodontal pathogens are also frequently recovered from saliva. the interrelationship of different periodontal conditions and the salivary levels of suspected periodontal pathogens is not known. in the present study, salivary levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and peptostreptococcus micros were determined by bacterial culture and related to clinical periodontal status in 40 subjects with either advanced, moderate, or initial/no periodontitis. culture-positive subjects harbored the 5 bacterial species in mean numbers ranging from 2 x 10(5) to 6 x 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml saliva. a. actinomycetemcomitans was found in none and p. gingivalis in one of the subjects with initial periodontitis, whereas both species were found in 33% and 44%, respectively, of the subjects with moderate periodontitis and in 60% and 40%, respectively, of the subjects with advanced periodontitis. the mean numbers  of cfu/ml of p. intermedia, c. rectus and p. micros were significantly higher in  subjects with advanced periodontitis than in subjects with initial/no periodontitis. ten patients with advanced periodontitis were treated mechanically and with adjunctive systemic metronidazole, and were re-examined 1 and 6 months after treatment. periodontal treatment eradicated or significantly reduced the levels of salivary periodontal pathogens for half a year, whereas in untreated subjects, the levels and the detection frequencies generally remained fairly stable. in conclusion, the results showed that the salivary levels of periodontal pathogens reflect the periodontal status of the patient.

TI  == bacterial colonization of the external and internal sulci and of cellulose membranes at time of retrieval.
AB  == membrane exposure with bacterial contamination is often considered one of the main reasons for the lack of predictability in achieving complete regeneration of periodontal defects. ten cellulose membranes, retrieved from 7 patients treated for class ii furcation lesions in lower molars with at least 4 mm of exposure at  time of retrieval were studied. contamination of exposed membranes was studied using sem analysis of four surfaces of the membrane, upper external, lower external, upper internal, and lower internal surfaces. dna probe analysis of three periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinmycetemcomitans, was carried out for specimens collected  from the external and internal sulci. the results suggest that bacterial contamination of the membranes could be controlled if proper pre- and postoperative care is followed, since significant amounts of any of the three periodontopathogenic bacteria studied were not found. the sem analysis corroborated the dna probe analysis since the predominant morphotypes detected were not suggestive of periodontopathogenic bacteria. the importance of membrane  contamination and of root concavities in the lack of predictability of the gtr procedure is discussed.

TI  == evidence for apoptosis of murine macrophages by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans infection.
AB  == the gram-negative bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered an important etiological agent in periodontal diseases. in this study, we show that  a. actinomycetemcomitans strains are cytotoxic for the murine macrophage cell line j774.1. on the other hand, porphyromonas gingivalis strains, other gram-negative oral species implicated in adult periodontitis, showed weak cytotoxic effects. for this to occur, a. actinomycetemcomitans had to gain entry  into the macrophages, since cytotoxicity was prevented by cytochalasin d. we demonstrate that cell death induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 occurs through apoptosis, as shown by changes in nuclear morphology, an increase in the proportion of fragmented dna, and the typical ladder pattern of dna fragmentation indicative of apoptosis. we further sought to determine whether the cytotoxicity  induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 could be modulated by the protein kinase inhibitors h7 and ha1004. apoptotic cell death induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 was suppressed by h7 but was relatively unaffected by ha1004. these findings suggest that the signals of protein kinases may regulate apoptosis induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans y4. the ability of a. actinomycetemcomitans to promote the apoptosis of macrophages may be important for the initiation of infection and the development of periodontal diseases.

TI  == comparative virulence of periodontopathogens in a mouse abscess model.
AB  == objective(s): this report compares the virulence of selected strains of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, f. nucleatum and t. denticola in a murine model as a measure of pathogenic potential of these oral microorganisms. the characteristics of the tissue destruction associated with these monoinfections were then related to a potential model for bacterial synergism in  progressing periodontitis. design and methods: all bacterial strains were grown to mid-logarithmic to early stationary growth phase, harvested and used at various doses to challenge balb/c normal and balb/c dexamethasone (dex) treated mice to mimic a neutrophil dysfunction. the characteristics of tissue destruction, and overt tissue destructive capacity of these species were examined as a function of challenge dose and time. outcome measures: the mice were examined for an interval of approximately 15 days post-challenge and the presence/absence of lesions, localized or generalized nature of the lesion (including size in mm2), and lethality of the infection were assessed. results: comparison of the virulence of the various p. gingivalis strains related to lethality and lesion size associated with destruction of the connective tissue, indicated a virulence capacity of p. gingivalis strains 53977>w50 = t22>3079>33277>381. c. rectus elicited localized necrotic lesions which were limited to the epithelial layers of the skin. the size of the lesions also indicated a graded difference in virulence, such that c. rectus strains 234>576>>33238. a. actinomycetemcomitans caused the formation of classic localized abscesses with a pmn infiltrate and inflammatory exudates. although each of the a. actinomycetemcomitans strains exhibited a similar virulence pattern in this murine model, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b representative  strains were potentially more pathogenic with a virulence capacity of 3113d-n = 3975a>jp2 > or = y4>29523>33384. both c. rectus and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains showed clear evidence that recent clinical isolates were more virulent than laboratory strains. challenge with f. nucleatum resulted in tissue destructive responses which were different from those observed with the other strains used in this study. a rapid onset of dose-dependent lesion development, related to the formation of either closed abscesses or open lesions, was observed with f. nucleatum. tissue involvement was also greater at lower f. nucleatum doses when compared to the other bacteria. f. nucleatum challenge of dex-treated  mice resulted in a shift to open lesions. t. denticola appeared to be more tissue invasive than the other species examined in this study. challenge of mice with t. denticola resulted in involvement of multiple tissues, including epithelial and connective tissues, as well as appearing to invade muscle layers and deeper tissues. in addition to invading deeper tissues, the resulting lesions took considerably longer to resolve. in the dex-treated mice (neutrophil depleted), p. gingivalis, c. rectus, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly more virulent. in contrast, while dex treatment altered the characteristics of lesions caused by f. nucleatum, the extent of lesions produced by f. nucleatum and t. denticola was not substantially enhanced. conclusions: the results obtained from  this study suggest that different microorganisms have the ability to provide individual pathologies which may act in an additive/synergistic fashion contributing to the tissue destruction noted in periodontitis.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, and their association with periodontal disease states in a population sample from sri lanka. based on clinical parameters, a total of 536 sites in 268 male sri lankan  tea workers were categorized as healthy, or showing gingivitis only, moderate or  advanced periodontitis. bacterial samples were obtained from all sites and the three target bacteria identified by indirect immunofluorescence. p. intermedia, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 76%, 40% and 15% of the  subjects, respectively. of the 536 periodontal sites, 10.5% were categorized with "no disease", 14% "gingivitis only": 59% with moderate and 16% with advanced periodontitis. the prevalence of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia was significantly higher in sites with moderate and advanced periodontitis than in sites with no disease or gingivitis only. a. actinomycetemcomitans was not found  in healthy sites, but occurred with equal frequency in sites with gingivitis, moderate and advanced periodontitis. the association between these three bacteria and periodontal diseases in sri lankan tea laborers was similar to that described for other non-industrialized and industrialized countries.

TI  == influence of periodontal bacteria and disease status on v beta expression in t cells.
AB  == some bacterial antigens such as s. aureus enterotoxins can selectively stimulate  t cells that express specific v beta genes of the t cell antigen receptor (tcr).  the purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not periodontal bacteria  could similarly alter the expression of v beta families within the tcr complex. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmncs) were isolated from 12 patients with early onset periodontitis and 11 periodontally-healthy controls. pbmncs were incubated in media alone, or co-cultured for 48 h with heat-inactivated a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia. expression of five v beta families (v alpha beta 2, v beta 5, v beta 6, v beta 8, and v beta 12) was determined by use of monoclonal antibodies. mean unstimulated expression of v alpha beta 2 and v beta 8 was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients than healthy controls. co-culture with the three bacteria resulted in significant changes (increases or decreases) in v beta expression in 27% of the trials. there were no significant differences in the number or direction of changes in samples  from patients and controls. when compared to unstimulated controls, 18 significant increases but no decreases in the percentage of cell expressing v alpha beta 2, v beta 5 or v beta 6 were noted following co-culture with p. intermedia. overall, co-culture with p. intermedia significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated expression of the five v beta families studied. these data suggest that periodontal bacteria may alter v beta expression within the t cell receptor  complex.

TI  == microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  == a total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. a subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. at baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2)  select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. there were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters  measured at the 7 different time points. the control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of p. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. after 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly veillonella dispar. this study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == oral microbiota in subjects with a weak or strong response in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to examine the composition of the oral microbiota in subjects who had previously demonstrated to develop either a weak or strong response to experimental gingivitis. for this study, subjects were selected from a pool of 25 individuals who had participated twice in an experimental gingivitis trial. out of these 25 panellists, 6 subjects were selected who had developed 2x a weak gingival inflammatory response and 7 subjects who had developed 2x a strong gingival inflammatory response. approximately 9 months after the 2nd experimental gingivitis trial, we evaluated  the clinical condition and the prevalence of a panel of selected oral micro-organisms in these subjects. the subjects were clinically examined for the  presence of plaque, bleeding, pocket depth and loss of attachment. for the microbiological evaluation, samples were taken from the mucous membranes, subgingival sites and saliva. samples were analyzed for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, spirochaetes and motile rods. clinical evaluation showed that most subjects had a relatively healthy periodontal condition. no clinically  significant differences could be detected between the weak and strong responding  groups. the microbial evaluation showed absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. micros in all subjects in either group. analysis of the microbial data for the weak and strong responding group showed no differences between the groups.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == semiquantitative analysis of periodontopathogens by gene amplification.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, which are known as major causative organisms of periodontitis, were semiquantitatively identified by two-step polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the sets of specific primers for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were prepared on the basis of the nucleotide sequences of the lkta and the fima genes, respectively. the set of universal primers for eubacteria was designed from the nucleotide sequence of  a highly conserved region in the eubacterial 16s rrna sequence. the number of bacteria detectable by one-step pcr assay was no fewer than 10(3) cells. less than 10(3) bacterial cells were detectable by two-step pcr assay. subgingival plaque samples from 37 sites of 16 patients were obtained with paperpoints and analyzed by two-step pcr assay. more than 2 x 10(6) bacterial cells were found in the subgingival plaque samples from all diseased sites. in contrast, the number of total bacteria in those from more than half of healthy sites estimated by pcr  assay was less than 2 x 10(6) cells, suggesting that subgingival plaque in diseased sites consists of a relatively larger number of bacteria compared with the population in healthy sites. while a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in both healthy and diseased sites, p. gingivalis was observed only in diseased sites. both periodontopathic bacteria occupied a minor part (less than 0.1%) of the total subgingival plaque bacteria.

AB  == in a 12-month multi-center study of 116 adult periodontitis subjects, six putative periodontal pathogens were monitored by dna probe methods in a subset of 31 subjects. monitored species included porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), eikenella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) with an  average detection limit of 1.8 x 10(4) bacterial colony forming units/sample. the microbiological response to four periodontal treatments was studied, one treatment in each quadrant; scaling and root planing (s), scaling and root planing with tetracycline (tc) fiber (sf), a single application of tc fiber (f) and two serial applications of tc fiber (ff). generally two sites were sampled in each quadrant, however, in some quadrants only one site was selected. these treatments were evaluated at baseline; immediately following therapy; and post-treatment at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. the study was conducted with a split-mouth design with no maintenance therapy over a 12-month period. at baseline, 70.8% of sites had detectable fn; 42.9% pg; 63.5% pi; 29.7% ec; 28.3% cr; and 5.5% aa. no significant differences were seen in baseline proportions of  these species between centers. numbers and proportions of detectable pathogens (with the exception of pg) exhibited a triphasic temporal response: a precipitous initial decrease immediately following therapy; a rise in proportions in the 1- to 3-month post-therapy period; and a spontaneous decline in the absence of therapy over the 3- to 12-month period.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == characterization of an antiproliferative surface-associated protein from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which can be neutralized by sera from a proportion of patients with localized juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the gentle agitation of suspensions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, b, or c in saline resulted in the release of a proteinaceous surface-associated material (sam) which produced a dose-dependent inhibition of tritiated thymidine incorporation by the osteoblast-like cell line mg63 in culture. this cell line was sensitive to low concentrations of sam (50% inhibitory concentration, 200 ng/ml for serotype c). immunoglobulin g antibodies  to constituents of the sam were found in the blood of patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp). sera from 9 of 16 patients with ljp significantly neutralized the antiproliferative activity of the sam, while sera from 15 controls, with no evidence of periodontal disease, were unable to neutralize this activity. neutralization was not directly related to the patient's antibody titer to the whole sam. characterization of the antiproliferative activity in the sam demonstrated that it was not cytotoxic and was heat and trypsin sensitive. the active component separated in a well-defined peak in anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) which, when further analyzed by size exclusion hplc, revealed a single active peak, which had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 8 kda. the lipopolysaccharide from a. actinomycetemcomitans was only weakly active. sam from porphyromonas gingivalis w50 and eikenella corrodens nctc 10596 did not exhibit any antiproliferative activity with this cell line, even at concentrations as high as 10 micrograms/ml. this study has shown that sam from a. actinomycetemcomitans contains a potent antiproliferative protein whose activity can be neutralized by antibodies in the  sera from some patients with ljp.

TI  == occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in chile.
AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp) patients. the subgingival proportion of  the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. the results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%)  there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, c. rectus, and f. nucleatum in ljp, and for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum in gjp. the mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (p < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. capnocytophaga sp, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in ljp. when taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with ljp and gjp in chile are p. gingivalis (66% of ljp and 80% of gjp affected sites), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of ljp and 50% in gjp affected sites). different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease  process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.

TI  == in vitro activity of tetracyclines, macrolides, quinolones, clindamycin and metronidazole against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == we re-evaluated several antibiotics including newer ones, for their in vitro killing activity, as well as their inhibitory activity, against clinical isolates of periodontopathic bacteria. tetracyclines were active against porphyromonas gingivalis, and were highly active against prevotella intermedia, but demonstrated only a low killing activity against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. rokitamycin, a new macrolide, and clindamycin were highly  active against p. gingivalis and p. intermedia, but showed very weak killing activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans. quinolones demonstrated excellent bactericidal activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans, and good inhibitory and bactericidal activity against p. gingivalis and p. intermedia. metronidazole had  an activity almost equivalent to quinolones against p. gingivalis and p. intermedia; but it was the least active against a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == effect of whole oral bacteria and extracted lipopolysaccharides on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-2 receptor expression.
AB  == expression of the interleukin-2 receptor (il-2r) on t cells is the molecular mechanism that initiates the g0 to g1 transition and is the critical first step for t cell proliferation in response to antigen. the effect of whole periodontal  bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (lps) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) il-2r expression was examined in vitro. lps induced a modest but significant increase in high affinity il-2r alpha/beta (p55/p75 positive) expression on pbmc over untreated cells after 48 h culture. addition of lps to pbmc cultures depleted of monocytes had no effect on il-2r expression compared to untreated cultures. interleukin-1 (il-1) caused a similar effect to lps in 48 h pbmc cultures but il-1 also increased high affinity il-2r expression in cultures  depleted of adherent mononuclear cells. when antibody to il-1 was simultaneously  added with lps to pbmc cultures, the high affinity il-2r inductive effect was reversed at 48 h, suggesting that the lps effect on pbmc il-2r was indirect, via  monocytes. whole pathogenic oral bacteria cultured with pbmc at high (100:1), but not low (10:1) bacteria:pbmc ratios had a similar effect to lps, inducing high affinity il-2r expression at 48 h. increases in soluble il-2r alpha were also measured in supernatants of pbmc incubated with periodontal bacteria compared to  untreated controls. in this system, a critical threshold of bacteria was required to activate pbmc perhaps related to the quantity of cell-surface lps presented to adherent mononuclear cells.

TI  == effect of periodontal treatments on serum igg antibody titers against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == serum igg antibody titers to 7 periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis patients were measured at the 1st visit and after various periodontal treatments  with clinically successful improvement, in order to evaluate what kind of factors are associated with changes of serum antibody titers. 20 patients (10 male and 10 female from 23 to 61 years old) with adult, rapidly progressive periodontitis were enrolled in this study. all patients received initial preparation and most of them also underwent surgical procedure. after the treatments, the mean probing pocket depths decreased from 3.72 mm to 1.56 mm. serum samples were collected from patients at the initial and final examinations. serum igg antibody titers against sonicated antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis fdc 381, prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, prevotella loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum atcc 25586, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, eikenella corrodens fdc 1073 and capnocytophaga ochracea # m 12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the mean antibody titers to p. gingivalis and p. intermedia decreased significantly after the treatment as compared to their pretreatment levels. the antibody titer to p. gingivalis, especially, decreased in all of the patients examined. a significant relationship was found between the decreased antibody titer to p. gingivalis and the number of teeth which received periodontal surgery, as well as treatment length, and the relationship between the decreased antibody titer to p. intermedia and the number of extracted teeth was also significant. these results suggest that the changes of serum igg titers against p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are related to the suppression of such pathogens in subgingival plague.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == patterns of antibody response in subjects with periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal diseases comprise a heterogeneous group of infections that are difficult to distinguish on a clinical basis alone. the purpose of the present investigation was to group periodontitis subjects according to their elevated serum antibody levels to specific subgingival species. a total of 119 subjects (19-70 years) with evidence of prior periodontal destruction were monitored at 2-month intervals (maximum 8 visits), prior to therapy, using clinical parameters measured at 6 sites per tooth. the probing attachment level was measured twice at each visit, and an increase of > 2.5mm at a site was used to define subjects with progressing disease. serum samples were obtained from each subject at each visit  and the level of antibody determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to 12 subgingival species. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of all teeth in each subject at each visit, and the levels of 14 different subgingival species were determined using a colony-lift method and dna probes. subjects were grouped by cluster analysis of their elevated antibody levels using a simple matching coefficient. ninety-two subjects fell into 9 clusters with 100% similarity; 29 subjects in one cluster group exhibited elevated antibody to none  of the test species. seven subjects in a second cluster group showed elevated antibody to bacteroides forsythus. subjects in the other 7 clusters showed elevated antibody to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a only or in combination with b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, prevotella intermedia or porphyromonas gingivalis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == periodontal status and selected cultivable anaerobic microflora of insulin-dependent juvenile diabetics.
AB  == the periodontal status and subgingival microflora of insulin-dependent juvenile diabetic (jd) patients (n = 16, mean age = 11.3) were compared with that of their non-diabetic cohabiting healthy siblings (hs, n = 16, mean age = 13.2). jd patients were monitored every 3 months for levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c) and clinical and microbial parameters were measured 6 weeks before drawing blood for levels of hba1c (m% = 8.76). clinical indices, measured for the entire permanent dentition, included: probing depth (pd), attachment level (al),  sulcus bleeding index (sbi), and plaque index (pi). subgingival plaque samples were obtained at 2 sites from each subject; whenever possible, the site with the  deepest probing depth and the mesial aspect of the maxillary right first molar were used. microbial analyses were determined by cultural characteristics and biochemical tests. no significant differences were detected in any of the clinical indices for the entire dentition. the mean al for jd sites was 2.32 +/-  0.83 mm and for hs sites was 2.2 +/- 0.85 mm. mean percentage of total cultivable anaerobic microflora included capnocytophaga spp. (jd, 13.21%; hs, 11%) and porphyromonas gingivalis (jd, 5.1%; hs, 7.9%). differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. when cluster analysis was performed on sampled sites, one cluster group in jd patients showed significantly elevated p.  gingivalis and lower capnocytophaga spp. levels as compared to the overall mean.  the clinical parameters of this cluster were characterized by statistically significant greater loss of attachment and probing depth. these data would suggest few differences between jd patients and their hs in this population.

AB  == the subgingival microflora and serum antibody response were examined in long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics and age- and sex-matched non-diabetics. the material consisted of 9 diabetics aged 40-49 years and 19 aged 50-59 years, 13 non-diabetics aged 40-49 years and 21 aged 50-59 years. the bacterial species  studied (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia) were recovered in diabetics as well as in non-diabetics. significantly more diabetics in both age groups harboured p. gingivalis compared to non-diabetics. prevalence of p. gingivalis was associated  with deepened periodontal pockets among non-diabetics but not among diabetics. in diabetics and non-diabetics, the serum antibody titres for most antigens were similar.

AB  == extensive clinical, microbiological, hematological, and immunological studies were performed on a patient with early onset periodontitis (eop) and two other members of the family. the proband, a 27-year-old female, had early onset periodontitis and a high level of serum rheumatoid factors (rf) with no diagnosable medical disease. her mother had lost all her teeth at the age of 50 because of advanced periodontitis, while her elder sister was unaffected by periodontitis. neither the proband's periodontally-affected mother nor her unaffected sister exhibited a detectable level of rf. in this study, we examined: 1) serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody titers against putative periodontal pathogenic bacteria; 2) peripheral neutrophil functions; 3) phenotypic analyses of peripheral lymphocyte subpopulations; and 4) peripheral lymphocyte functions (t cell proliferative activity, ability of cytokine [interleukin (il)-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, il-6 and il-8] and igg and igm productivity). high antibody titers to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and campylobacter rectus were detected in the sera of the proband, as were high serum antibody titers to p. gingivalis in the mother and to c. rectus in the unaffected sister compared to the non-periodontitis affected subjects. the proband also showed enhanced neutrophil chemotaxis; a high percentage of pan-b cells; and high productivity of il-6, igg, and igm compared to individuals who were not periodontally affected. the mother showed slightly low helper/induced t cells (th/i) suppressor/cytotoxic t cells (ts/c) ratios due  to the elevated count of ts/c, and high ifn-gamma productivity compared to control subjects.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == critical issues in periodontal research.
AB  == the purpose of this paper is to highlight briefly the major achievements and the  remaining critical issues in the areas of epidemiology, microbiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy. periodontitis affects a relatively small proportion of study populations in the united states and other countries. prevalence may be decreasing, but that remains to be seen. the identity and characteristics of susceptible individuals and groups are not known, and risk indicators for severe disease are only beginning to be identified. a very large number of different microbial species has been implicated in the etiology. it seems unlikely that all of these are essential participants. essential participants need to be identified and better characterized. whether putative pathogens are members of the commensal flora or exogenous species that must be transmitted is unclear. the relationship between the presence of a pathogenic flora and disease status is obscure. pathogenic bacterial species are essential,  but insufficient to cause disease. a susceptible host and local environmental factors--for example, elevated iron concentration--may be necessary for disease to occur. many clonal types may not be virulent, and numbers greater than certain threshold levels appear to be necessary. the pathways by which bone and connective tissues of the periodontium are destroyed are sufficiently understood  to permit development of therapies aimed at their modification. examples are the  use of vaccines, topical application of anti-inflammatory drugs, and use of chemically modified tetracyclines.

AB  == macrophages respond to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) and activate several host defense functions through production of mediators. however, it is not clear  whether the degree of macrophage responsiveness to different sources of lps is equivalent to or varies with the source of lps. therefore, in this report, we examined the extent of the human monocyte response to lps derived from two oral pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg). additionally, due to its well-established ability to activate monocytes, we used lps from escherichia coli (ec). human monocytes, when activated with a specific source of lps, exhibited rapid expression of mrna for il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, and il-8, which was followed by il-6, as measured by rna-pcr. moreover, the expression of mrna for these cytokines was followed by cytokine synthesis. monocytes from the same subject, when activated with lps from pg, aa,  or ec expressed quantitatively different levels of mrna and proteins for all four cytokines. a given lps induced either high or low expression of the battery of cytokines tested, indicating that the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines may be regulated by a single or a cluster of gene(s). however, no apparent differences in the time course of mrna expression for these cytokines were observed in response to any of the lps tested. furthermore, the relative ability of the different sources of lps to induce mrna for cytokines varied throughout a wide range of lps concentrations. this suggests that differences exist in the sensitivity of monocytes to a specific lps, rather than in the kinetics of the secretory process itself.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. a second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mm (0.1%) or 6.4 mm (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. for electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. treatment with 6.4 mm delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. the result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. more material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. it appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.

TI  == periodontopathogens in elderly chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  == if an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. to test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group,  each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia group, prevotella melaninogenica group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, campylobacter rectus as well as predominant streptococcus and actinomyces species. during the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. the latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and actinomyces recovery. similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. it is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == bacterial steroidogenesis by periodontal pathogens and the effect of bacterial enzymes on steroid conversions by human gingival fibroblasts in culture.
AB  == studies were performed to investigate the effect of microbial culture supernatants of periodontal pathogens on the metabolism of radiolabelled testosterone in the presence or absence of human gingival fibroblasts. subgingival plaque samples were obtained on paper points from 3 sites with probing depth values of 6-8 mm. samples were incubated with 14c-testosterone for  24 h in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth. similar incubations were also carried out with strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedius and p. gingivalis to study the metabolism of radiolabelled testosterone by these periodontal pathogens. at the end of a 24 h incubation period with fibroblasts and supernatants or sonicates, the radioactive metabolites were extracted with ethyl  acetate, evaporated and subjected to thin layer chromatography. the separated metabolites were quantified by scanning the radioactive plates using a berthold linear analyser. when three sub-gingival plaque samples were incubated with radiolabelled testosterone there were 50-fold, 10-12-fold and 15-17-fold increases in 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (dht) synthesis over 4-androstenedione production in these mixed microbial cultures. the two strains of p. intermedius produced 3- and 20-fold increases in 4-androstenedione production and dht synthesis respectively. both strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis showed 3-4-fold and 12-28-fold increases respectively in 4-androstenedione synthesis over that of dht. culture supernatants of p. intermedius and p. gingivalis caused 3-fold and 2-fold increases in dht synthesis by fibroblasts over controls. there was little change in the case of the third pathogen. since dht has implications on matrix synthesis by fibroblasts in the environment of plaque associated inflammatory periodontal disease, bacterial metabolism and the effect of bacterial supernatants on human gingival fibroblasts can influence the degree of inflammatory repair.

TI  == comparison of the osteolytic activity of surface-associated proteins of bacteria  implicated in periodontal disease.
AB  == objectives: to compare the osteolytic activity of surface-associated material (sam) and lipid a-associated proteins (laps) from periodontopathogenic bacteria.  materials and methods: surface-associated material was extracted from the surface and laps from the cell walls of a range of periodontopathic bacteria including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens. these bacterial fractions were assayed to determine their composition and their capacity to induce bone resorption was determined by use of the neonatal murine calvarial bone resorption assay. results: the sams from e. corrodens and a. actinomycetemcomitans demonstrated bone-resorbing capacity at concentrations as low as 1 ng ml-1 which, given the molecular weights of the active components, is  in the picomolar range of activity. in contrast, the sams from the other three bacteria were significantly less potent and showed a lower efficacy. the laps all showed significant, and similar, capacities to induce bone breakdown. conclusions: this is the first demonstration that lap from periodontopathic bacteria can stimulate bone degradation. the laps from diverse bacteria all produced similar levels of bone-resorbing activity. in contrast, the sam showed significant differences in potency and in efficacy (maximal stimulation). this may mean that in vivo certain periodontopathic bacteria have significantly more bone-resorbing capacity than others and should be therapeutic targets.

AB  == when neutrophils are incubated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps), they become primed for enhanced release of superoxide anion (o2-) in response to stimulation by fmlp. we investigated the human neutrophil-priming activity of lps from the periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) in comparison with  that of lps from escherichia coli (e. coli). the optimum conditions for lps to prime neutrophils were assessed for every lps and found to be as follows: neutrophils were incubated with lps in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated plasma and 1 mm edta at 37 degrees c for 30 min and then stimulated with 1 microm fmlp at 37 degrees c for 7 min. under these conditions, half-maximum priming was  observed at 6.2 ng/ml pg-lps, 45 ng/ml pi-lps, 1.5 ng/ml aa-lps and 1.5 ng/ml e.  coli-lps. the priming activity of each lps was neutralized by polymyxin b. anti-cd14 monoclonal antibody inhibited priming by all lps. the priming by aa-lps and e. coli-lps was inhibited by la-14-pp, a synthetic lipid a precursor iva, but that by pg-lps and pi-lps was not. priming by tumor necrosis factor alpha was not affected by polymyxin b, anti-cd14 antibody or la-14-pp. gelation of limulus amebocyte lysate occurred at 10 pg/ml pg-lps, 30 pg/ml pi-lps, 3 pg/ml aa-lps and 3 pg/ml e. coli-lps. thus lps from different periodontal pathogens primed neutrophils with different efficacy.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == periodontal findings in spouses. a clinical, radiographic and microbiological study.
AB  == clinical, radiographic and microbiological examination of periodontal conditions  was carried out in 2 groups of married couples to assess similarities between husband and wife. the diseased probands (n = 10) exhibited advanced periodontitis and the healthy ones (n = 10) were periodontally normal. the clinical examination comprised the assessment of plaque, probing pocket depths, gingival bleeding on probing, suppuration, supragingival and subgingival calculus. the extent and type of alveolar bone loss was determined from panoramic radiographs. bacterial samples were taken from the 6 deepest and most inflamed periodontal pockets and from stimulated saliva. the samples were cultured for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus and peptostreptococcus micros. the mean detection frequency  of moderately deep pockets (4-5 mm) and deep pockets (> or = 6 mm) was significantly higher in the diseased probands than in their spouses. the mean detection frequency of moderately deep pockets was significantly higher in the spouses of the diseased probands than in the spouses of the healthy ones. deep pockets were found in 6 spouses of the diseased probands, whereas only in 2 spouses of the healthy ones. both diseased proband and his/her spouse harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, c. rectus and p. micros in 4, 6, 9, 9 and 4 couples, respectively. both healthy proband and his/her spouse harbored the pathogens in 0, 1, 9, 5 and 3 couples, respectively. p. gingivalis was found in 7 spouses of the diseased probands, but only in 2 spouses of the healthy ones.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == prognostic criteria for the efficiency of non-surgical periodontal therapy in advanced periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of the study was to find out which clinical, radiographic and microbiological variables can be used as prognostic criteria for the efficiency of the commonly used initial treatment protocol comprising scaling, root planning and instruction on oral hygiene in advanced adult periodontitis. 46 patients (mean age 48 years) with untreated, advanced periodontitis volunteered for the study. the clinical examination included recordings of plaque, gingival and calculus indices, probing pocket depths, bleeding and suppuration after probing,  probing attachment levels and furcation involvements. infrabony and furcation lesions were assessed from panoramic radiographs. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were cultured from the deepest, most inflamed periodontal pockets, from surface of the tongue and from saliva. 3 months after the completion of non-surgical treatment comprising meticulous scaling and root planing and instruction on oral hygiene, the healing  was assessed clinically, and 13 patients were assigned to a maintenance care programme (mc) and 33 to further treatment procedures (ft). evaluation of the baseline clinical and radiographic data showed a significantly higher %s of > or  = 6 mm deep periodontal pockets, surfaces with suppuration, and sites with subgingival calculus, as well as higher numbers of infrabony lesions, in ft-patients than in mc-patients. subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans was isolated at baseline in 55% of the ft-patients and in 38% of the mc-patients, and p. gingivalis in 27% and 23%, respectively. a. actinomycetemcomitans was eradicated by non-surgical treatment from only one patient. p. gingivalis was detected in 15% of the patients in both groups after treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a population of 33 subjects were selected on the basis that all had tested positive for a, actinomycetemcomitans at some time during the prior 7 years. most subjects (31/33) belonged to families with a proband with confirmed localized juvenile periodontitis (jp); however, most subjects had no evidence of the typical lesions associated with jp. two additional subjects with rapidly progressive periodontitis, known to be positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, were also recruited. the patients with a history of jp had been treated, but were no longer enrolled in a regular maintenance program. with 3 exceptions, the subjects had not received any dental treatment or antibiotics in the past 3 months. one aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus in this population. the main purpose was to compare the relative sensitivity of various methods for detecting these periodontal pathogens. pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from all the mesial surfaces and aliquots of the suspension processed for the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans by culture and indirect immunofluorescence (if) to serotypes a, b, and c. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus  were monitored with a dna probe and if. with culture, a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 39.4% of the samples, at a mean level of 0.64% of the cultivable  counts. with if, a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 81.8% of the samples, at levels of 0.40, 0.79, and 0.17% of the total counts for serotypes a, b and c respectively. overall, if was more likely to detect a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  gingivalis, and b. forsythus than any of the other methods.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  == periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (jp), rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp), and adult periodontitis (ap), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. these disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. the present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of pbmc of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. the ap group had a significantly lower production of il-1ra when stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) (p < 0.05). streptococcus sanguis (s.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of il-1 alpha and tnf alpha production in all groups. the rpp group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (mc) than the ap group (p < 0.05). additionally, jp patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (p < 0.05). in conclusion, il-1 alpha, tnf alpha, or il-6 production by peripheral blood mc after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. the results support the hypothesis that the cytokine il-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: rpp and ap. furthermore, elevated mc concentration in the rpp group compared to the ap group may be an important pathogenic feature in rpp.

AB  == saline extracts of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens contain surface-associated components of these bacteria.  it has been shown that these extracts are potent stimulators of bone resorption in vitro. the possibility that the components of these surface-associated materials (sam) could contribute to the serum immune response in patients with juvenile or adult onset forms of rapidly progressive periodontitis were investigated by direct binding elisa. very high titres of serum igg antibodies to sam from a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp). patients with adult onset rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp) had significantly raised antibody levels to sam from p. gingivalis. both groups of patients had significantly raised levels of antibodies to sam from e. corrodens compared with control sera. thus, not only does solubilized sam have the capacity to induce bone resorption, but it also contributes to the antigenic load on the immune system in ljp and rpp.

TI  == the effect of plaque control in subjects with shallow pockets and high prevalence of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == [how sensible are bacteriological tests in periodontology?].
AB  == periodontitis is a mixed infection with subgingival bacteria that belong to the microflora of the host. the bacteriological tests (microscopy, culture, omnigene, affirm dp and evalusite) are mainly aimed at spirochetes or a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia. the detection limits of the different tests vary and, therefore, the detection levels are between 0.01-10% of the subgingival microflora. however, threshold levels to distinguish  between diseased and carrier state are not established and the low sensitivity and specificity of the tests limit their diagnostic usefulness. the correlation between the tested bacteria and periodontitis does not mean a causal relationship. as a result, the justification of the elimination of the tested bacteria is questionable. the tests of the subgingival plaque do not only add to  the microbiological knowledge, but might also promote the overtreatment with antibiotics, such as the in the netherlands popular combination of amoxicilline and metronidazole. the balance between host and microflora can be restored in most patients by mechanical elimination of the mainly gram negative anaerobic subgingival plaque. in special occasions metronidazole can be empirically prescribed in order to support the subgingival debridement. in the relatively rare occasions of superinfection, a sensitivity test of the subgingival microbiota is recommended.

AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial agents is based on in vivo and in vitro studies. the  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of sodium benzoate and dichlorobenzyl alcohol to 115 strains of plaque microorganisms were determined by a broth-dilution method. sodium benzoate did not inhibit growth of any gram-positive cocci (mic > 106,590 microm). mics for porphyromonas gingivalis and two strains of treponema socranskii were 26,650 microm. the mic of dichlorobenzyl alcohol to the reference strain of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 723 microm and to p. gingivalis, two strains of t. socranskii, and candida albicans 1,446 microm. mics for other organisms were 2,892 to 5,784 microm. saliva samples from 10 volunteers, collected at various times after toothbrushing with a dentifrice containing 10% sodium benzoate and 0.3% dichlorobenzyl alcohol, were analyzed gas-chromatographically. immediately after toothbrushing mean levels of  sodium benzoate and dichlorobenzyl alcohol were 372,626 microm and 7,529 microm,  respectively. after 5 min mean levels were 38,700 microm and 734 microm. in conclusion, the concentrations of both antimicrobials dropped rapidly during the  first 30 min, but for 5-10 min they were high enough to inhibit growth of potential periodontal pathogens.

TI  == microbiologic tests in epidemiologic studies: are they reproducible?
AB  == microbiologic assessments are often included in longitudinal studies to elucidate the significance of the association of certain gram-negative bacteria and the development of periodontal diseases. in such studies, the reliability of methods  is crucial. there are several methods to identify putative pathogens, and some of them are commercially available. the purpose of the present study was to compare  the reproducibility of four different methods for detecting actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in order to evaluate their usefulness in epidemiologic studies. the test panel consisted of 10 young subjects and 10 adult periodontitis patients. subgingival plaque was sampled from sites showing bone loss and "healthy" control sites. the  four different methods for detecting the target bacteria were 1) cultivation, 2)  evalusite (a chair-side kit based on elisa), 3) omnigene, inc, based on dna probes, and 4) indirect immunofluorescence (iif). the test procedure was repeated after a 1-wk interval and was performed by one examiner. sites reported to be positive for a microorganism by any of the four methods at one or both examinations were considered to be positive for that organism and included in the analysis. the reproducibility of the four methods was low. the iif and the cultivation methods showed somewhat higher reproducibility than did the commercial systems. a second test was done for evalusite, three paper points for  sampling being used instead of one as described in the manual. the reproducibility of the second test was improved, indicating that the detection level of the system may influence the reliability.

AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

AB  == the relationships between various forms of periodontal disease and the avidities  of serum antibodies of all 3 immunoglobulin (ig) classes (igg, igm and iga) to porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were investigated. twenty-four patients with untreated adult periodontitis and twelve  untreated patients diagnosed as suffering from the early-onset form of periodontitis, rapidly progressive periodontitis, were studied. the latter group  were matched for age and sex to healthy controls. antibody titres were measured and avidity (expressed as molarity) was further assayed using the thiocyanate elution method. avidity has previously been shown to relate to the biological function of antibody. igm avidities to p. gingivalis were lower in the rapidly progressive periodontitis group than in the adult periodontitis group (0.54 m vs  0.74 m). igg avidities tended to be lower in the former than in the latter group  (0.58 m vs 0.92 m). in accordance with other workers, seropositivity was defined  as an immunoglobulin titre more than twice the median level of control sera. only 2 of the rapidly progressive periodontitis group were seropositive. interestingly, the seronegative rapidly progressive periodontitis patients were significantly different (0.53 m vs 0.92 m). the data that patients with various forms of periodontal disease appear to produce antibodies of differing avidity to p. gingivalis suggest that the quality of the humoral immune response to suspected periodontopathogens may have a bearing on the aetiology of periodontal  disease.

TI  == effect of local metronidazole application on periodontal healing following guided tissue regeneration. microbiological findings.
AB  == the bacteriological colonization of healing periodontal defects was investigated  after treatment with guided tissue regeneration using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membranes together with local metronidazole gel (25%, 250 mg/g). twelve patients, each with one pair of comparable defects, had the test defect treated with the membrane plus metronidazole gel and the control defect treated with the membrane alone. thirty weeks after removal of the membrane, the  median gain in probing attachment level as a percentage of the initial defect depth was 92% for the test defects and 50% for the control defects (p = 0.001). the median number of cultivable bacteria decreased from 1.2 x 10(6) at the presurgical examination to 3.0 x 10(5) at the one week examination in the test group (p = 0.02), whereas an increase was observed in the control group. similarly, a lower median proportion of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods was observed one week postsurgically in the test group (0.004%) compared to  the control group (3.5%) (p = 0.02). two weeks after membrane insertion, and at all following examinations, no microbiological differences between test and control group were observed. consequently, the influence of the metronidazole gel on the treatment result appears to have been confined to the initial regeneration phase. despite the good clinical results in the test group, all membranes from both test and control pockets were heavily colonized with bacteria at the time of removal. to ensure maximal periodontal regeneration with formation of bone, future research in this area should concentrate on reducing the microbial colonization of the wound area.

AB  == the present study was carried out in a private periodontal practice. 8 clinical criteria were chosen to select patients for microbiological examination. these criteria characterize prominent features of disease which at the start, during, or in the maintenance phase of treatment suggest difficulties in the progress of  the periodontal therapy. based on these clinical characteristics, an inventory was made of the prevalence of the 3 putative periodontal pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia. out of 320 referred patients 91 patients did meet > or = 1 of the clinical criteria and consequently were selected for microbiological examination. results showed that young patients (19-30 years) with periodontitis demonstrated  the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans more often (69%: p < 0.005) compared to  older age cohorts. a. actinomycetemcomitans was found more often when localized breakdown (in particular in the 1st molar and incisor region) was observed and in patient who responded poorly to scaling and rootplaning. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were most frequently recovered in patients showing primarily a bone loss pattern of angular defects of > or = 5 mm. retrospectively, these patients were further categorized, based on full mouth radiographs, in (1) patients with primarily horizontal bone loss and (2) patients with primarily angular bony defects. results showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans occurred less frequently in patients showing horizontal bone loss (p < 0.05).

TI  == the influence of supragingival plaque control on clinical and microbial outcomes  following the use of antibiotics for the treatment of periodontitis.
AB  == although supragingival plaque control is essential to successful periodontal therapy, the role of plaque control following systemic antibiotic use in periodontal disease has not been well defined. this study evaluated, following antibiotic use, which clinical and microbial parameters appeared to be influenced primarily by the antibiotics, independent of plaque control, and which outcomes appeared to be dependent on plaque control. two hundred thirty-six patients (236) with moderate to severe periodontitis were clinically evaluated and microbial samples were taken by their private-practice periodontists. all patients were treated with scaling and root planing and a variety of systemic antibiotics, which were selected based on the microbial and clinical profile of the patient. three months after therapy, patients were reevaluated and grouped by post-treatment plaque control, as either having very good oral hygiene (lopl: n = 143; < or = 10% plaque-covered surfaces) or poor oral hygiene (hipl: n = 93; > or = 25% plaque-covered surfaces). the two groups had different plaque and bleeding  scores initially, but similar numbers of pockets probing > 5 mm and similar microbial patterns. although the lopl group had a significantly greater reduction in plaque than the hipl group, bleeding scores and probing depths changed comparably in both groups after antibiotic therapy. plaque control influenced outcomes significantly, but in a complex manner. the lopl group exhibited a significantly greater reduction in certain bacteria, for example p. gingivalis. interactions between plaque control and specific microbial parameters significantly affected clinical outcomes, although neither alone was sufficient to predict outcomes following antibiotic therapy.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == locally delivered minocycline and guided tissue regeneration to treat post-juvenile periodontitis. a case report.
AB  == a case of post-juvenile periodontitis in a 28-year-old female patient is described along with new periodontal treatment modalities. administration of minocycline-hcl with local drug delivery system was introduced as a part of initial periodontal therapy following microbiological and immunological examinations. the lesions were subsequently treated by guided tissue regeneration, which resulted in considerable gain of attachment with minimal recession of marginal gingiva. this observation suggests that the local delivery  of antibiotics and regenerative therapy may prove to be effective alternative modalities in treatment of post-juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == interdental supragingival plaque--a natural habitat of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that suspected periodontal pathogens form a minor component of the supragingival plaque of individuals without periodontal diseases. twenty-one dental hygienist trainees with a mean age of 23.5 years were twice sampled for interdental plaque between 1st and 2nd molars in all quadrants. the samples were assessed for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and the prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group of organisms. bacteria of this group were predominantly p. nigrescens and showed both the highest prevalence (100%) and the highest colonization density of the investigated species. seven of 21 samples harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans. serotypes a, b, and c were found in three samples each, while serotype e was present in one sample. three subjects had two different a. actinomycetemcomitans  serotypes. bacteroides forsythus and c. rectus were detected in 10 (48%) and nine (43%) subjects, respectively. the detected cell numbers accounted for approximately 0.01% to 1% of the sampled flora. in contrast, p. gingivalis was found only in a single sample, which in addition harbored b. forsythus, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes b and e), and p. intermedia. these results suggest that the investigated periodontal bacteria are not "exogenous pathogens", but amphibiotic, opportunistic microorganisms which may have a natural habitat in the supragingival plaque of the interproximal area of molars.

TI  == clinical and microbiological status of osseointegrated implants.
AB  == peri-implantitis, an inflammatory response around implants, has a poorly defined  etiology and pathogenesis. to better understand the role of specific microorganisms in this disease process, clinical and microbiological parameters were examined in 24 patients with 98 osseointegrated implants. sites were evaluated for probing depth (pd), plaque/calculus index (pi), gingival bleeding index (gbi), mobility, and crevicular fluid flow rate (cffr). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque were identified by latex agglutination assays. clinically, a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.001) was observed between probing depth and the length of time an implant was present. mobility was also significantly greater (p < 0.001) in the maxillary than in the mandibular implants. subgingival sites harboring one of the three microorganisms had significantly greater pd, gbi, and cffr than non-colonized sites. implants in partially edentulous patients more frequently were colonized with p. gingivalis/p. intermedia than edentulous patients. the incidence of these microorganisms also correlated with fixture longevity. implants present for 3 to  4 years had a significantly greater frequency of test microorganisms than implants present for 1 to 2 years. these findings suggest that microbial pathogens associated with periodontitis occur more commonly around implants exhibiting gingival inflammation (gbi) and may contribute to peri-implantitis.

TI  == short-term effect of full-mouth extraction on periodontal pathogens colonizing the oral mucous membranes.
AB  == in this study, we investigate the prevalence of selected periodontal pathogens on the oral mucous membranes before and after full-mouth tooth extractions in patients with severe periodontitis. 8 patients were microbiologically examined 2  x before and 2 x after extraction; several locations on the oral mucous membranes, saliva, supra- and subgingival plaque, were sampled. besides their presence in subgingival plaque, we detected before extraction on the mucous membranes actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in 2 patients (mean 0.03%), porphyromonas gingivalis in 6 patients (mean 9%), and prevotella intermedia (mean 2%) and other prevotella species (mean 7%) in all patients. at 1 and 3 months after extraction, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis could not be detected in any of these patients on the oral mucous membranes and in saliva, while from all patients still p. intermedia (mean 3%) and the other blackpigmented prevotella species (mean 4%) could be isolated. these results indicate that the preferable habitat for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis is dental plaque in subgingival lesions. p. intermedia and the other blackpigmented prevotella species can colonize the oral mucous membranes of edentulous patients irrespective of the presence of a subgingival microflora. we  speculate that in periodontal patients the colonization of mucous membranes with  p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans is transient in nature and most likely the result of dissemination from the subgingival microflora. thus it seems unlikely that edentulous patients constitute a reservoir of infection of p. gingivalis a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens with varying metabolic control of diabetes mellitus.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of 5 periodontal pathogens in individuals with diabetes mellitus. subjects (n = 107) 20-70 years of age with type 1 (n = 60) or 2 (n = 47) diabetes mellitus were studied for the  occurrence of the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, e. corrodens, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia. subgingival plaque was sampled in  each subject from a single site exhibiting the greatest inflammation. the evaluation of selected periodontal bacterial pathogens was based on an immunoassay utilizing bacterial specific monoclonal antibodies. 35% of the sites  harbored p. gingivalis, 28% f. nucleatum and 21% e. corrodens. a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. intermedia were found in less than 10% of the sites. subjects for whom the probing depth at the sampled site was > or = 4 mm were more often found to have detectable pathogens than those with a probing depth < or = 3 mm. diabetic factors such as duration, type and metabolic control of the disease  had no statistically significant effect on the prevalence of these bacteria.

AB  == the purposes of this study were two-fold: to compare the dna probe and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) microbial identification tests and correlate the levels of microorganisms with adult periodontitis. a single plaque sample were taken from each of 2 sites in 52 patients. twelve of these patients were also sampled during and after treatment. the experimental site had clinical indicators of disease (bleeding on probing, probing and attachment loss of > or = 6 mm) and the contralateral site (control) was clinically healthy. a total of 176 plaque samples were collected, divided, processed, and sent for both types of quantitative microbial analyses. all of these samples were used to compare the dna probe and elisa methods while only the initial 104 pretreatment sites were used to correlate microorganisms/method with clinical indicators of adult periodontitis. dna probes were used to assay for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, and c. rectus. an elisa utilizing monoclonal antibodies was used to assay for p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, t. denticola, and c. rectus. comparison of the two methods revealed that the elisa test identified p. gingivalis and c. rectus significantly more often than the dna probe method and that t. denticola was detected more frequently with the dna probe. the sensitivities and specificities  varied widely among organisms and by test. p. gingivalis, as identified by elisa, had the highest degree of sensitivity and specificity (0.90 and 0.82 respectively) to clinical indicators of adult periodontitis.

AB  == this clinical study evaluated the survival rates of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in periodontal pockets following scaling and root planing and intra-pocket irrigation with antimicrobial agents in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis. the number of target organisms was determined utilizing dna probes. adult periodontitis patients were selected on the basis that the subgingival flora contained at least one of the target organisms. forty-eight (48) inflamed pockets > or = 5 mm in depth with probing attachment loss and containing at least one of the target species were then selected in 7 adult patients who harbored these bacteria. following baseline clinical and bacterial examination, all patients received thorough scaling and root planing. in addition, 1 or 2 teeth in each patient which harbored the target flora at baseline were randomly assigned to each of the following 4 treatment modalities:  1) control group, no irrigation; 2) saline group, irrigation with 2 cc of physiologic saline; 3) tetracycline group, irrigation with 2 cc of aqueous tetracycline hydrochloride, 50 mg/ml (5%); and 4) chlorhexidine group, irrigation with 2 cc 0.12% chlorhexidine. all selected sites (5 to 8 per patient) were nonadjacent teeth. clinical parameters and microbial analysis were recorded again at one week, and one month post-irrigation. the survival rate of the target microorganisms was determined and the effect of irrigation with antimicrobial agents on this microflora was compared with the control groups (1 and 2).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == detection and strain identification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans by nested pcr.
AB  == by using pcr, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains were identified directly from plaque samples without the need to isolate or culture bacteria. dna fragments were generated by a nested, two-step pcr amplification of the ribosomal spacer region between the 16s and 23s rrna genes. for the first amplification, primers homologous to sequences common to all bacterial species were used. this was followed by a second amplification with primers specific to a. actinomycetemcomitans. the ribosomal dna spacer region was amplified from as few  as 10 bacterial cells within a total population of 10(8) cells (0.00001%), and cross-reactivity between species was not observed. dna fragments specific for porphyromonas gingivalis were generated from the same samples by using a p. gingivalis-specific primer, and equivalent sensitivity and specificity were observed. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 60% and p. gingivalis was detected in 79% of 52 subjects tested. sequence analysis of the spacer region dna fragment for a. actinomycetemcomitans gave precise strain identification, producing unique sequences for seven reference strains and identification of nine plaque-derived isolates. a phylogenetic tree based on quantitative sequence relationships was constructed. two-step pcr amplification directly from plaque samples combined with sequence analysis of the ribosomal dna spacer region provides a sensitive assay for detection and strain identification of multiple species directly from a single plaque sample. this simplified approach provides a practical method for large-scale studies on the transmission and pathogenicity of periodontitis-associated bacteria.

TI  == clinical, bacteriological, and immunological examinations and the treatment process of two papillon-lefevre syndrome patients.
AB  == papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) is a rare disease associated with the early onset of periodontal breakdown in deciduous and permanent dentition. the etiology of the destruction has not been completely clarified. two female patients (ages 4 and 7 years) with severe destruction of the periodontal structures were examined. except for palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis, dermatologic examination revealed no other medical disorders. on immunological analysis, measurement of serum antibody titers to 7 periodontopathic bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). further immunoblot analysis of a. actinomycetemcomitans and microbial culture of samples collected from deep periodontal pockets and mouthrinse solution were performed. the serum of the two  patients showed high igg titer against a. actinomycetemcomitans. immunoblot results of the two patients against sonicated extract of a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 strain exhibited a similar pattern. the band pattern differed from that observed in other forms of early onset periodontitis patients or periodontally healthy subjects. moreover, a. actinomycetemcomitans colonies were cultured in high percentages from the pocket samples. antibiotic therapy was instituted in addition to conventional periodontal therapy. in the younger patient, all deciduous teeth were extracted as part of the treatment and a. actinomycetemcomitans was no longer detected. all four permanent first molars and 8 permanent incisors subsequently erupted with healthy periodontium. however, the older patient did not improve after periodontal and antibiotic (minocycline and erythromycin) treatments and a. actinomycetemcomitans was consistently detected.  ofloxacin medication finally eliminated a. actinomycetemcomitans from the periodontal pockets. this antibiotic was also associated with reduced gingival inflammation and probing depth.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate one year of maintenance therapy in young adults with severe periodontitis (sp) who had previously received periodontal therapy consisting of root planing and scaling followed by open flap  debridement. subjects were evaluated with clinical and microbiological measurements at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following the completion of active therapy. subjects were included in the study if they completed a minimum of two evaluation appointments. monitoring of these subjects during the maintenance phase was analyzed by three methods. first, changes in mean attachment level and  mean probing depth were calculated at 3-month intervals to determine if the subjects continued to lose or gain attachment and/or had periodontal pockets of increasing or decreasing depth. second, the frequency of periodontal breakdown was determined and compared to breakdown rates of subjects in other patient populations. third, future changes in attachment level were related to the presence or absence of two putative periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque. mean attachment level remained constant in 13 subjects who completed one year of maintenance therapy. however, mean probing depth increased at a yearly rate of 0.19 mm and in periodontally-involved sites pocket depth increased at a yearly rate of 0.65 mm both of which were statistically significantly different from 0 (p < .05). the frequency of periodontal breakdown in this study was higher than reported in other similar studies of different periodontitis patient populations. the remainder of the data in the study was from 21 subjects who had completed at  least two recall appointments.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == periodontal therapy in young adults with severe generalized periodontitis.
AB  == this study evaluated the effect of periodontal therapy on clinical and microbiological parameters in 23 subjects with severe generalized early onset periodontitis. therapy consisted of oral hygiene instruction and root planing and scaling, followed 3 months later by open flap debridement. subjects were monitored for both clinical measures and levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromas gingivalis as identified by indirect immunofluoresence. clinical and microbiological evaluations were done at the start of the study, 3 months after the completion of root planing and scaling and 3 months after open flap debridement. mean probing depth was reduced by both root planing and scaling and open flap debridement and the level of reduction demonstrated by both phases of therapy was similar to reductions found in studies that utilized subjects with chronic adult periodontitis. in contrast, reductions  in attachment level due to the two phases of therapy, demonstrated in previous studies of subjects with adult periodontitis were not found in the young adult subjects with severe periodontal disease utilized in this study. levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans were not significantly affected by root planing and scaling, but were reduced by open flap debridement. p. gingivalis was virtually eliminated by root planing and scaling, demonstrating that the two bacterial types respond differently to periodontal therapy. these changes in microbiological parameters were similar to those found in studies of localized juvenile periodontitis subjects, where surgery or antibiotics have been shown to  be necessary to reduce levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == relationship between salivary blood group antigens, microbial flora and periodontal condition in young adults.
AB  == to investigate a possible role for salivary blood-group antigens in the relative  frequencies of selected periodontal pathogens and commensal oral micro-organisms, we studied the clinical and microbiological condition in young adults with or without blood group reactive substances in saliva (secretors or non-secretors respectively). clinical measurements were recorded at the ramfjord teeth in 81 1st-year dental students. in addition, presence of interproximal loss of attachment (la) was assessed at sites with a pocket depth of > or = 4 mm. microbiological samples were taken from one of the ramfjord teeth (site without interproximal la), from interproximal sites of > or = 4 mm in conjunction with la, and from the saliva. the samples were analyzed for the presence of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. clinically, no statistically significant differences were found in the periodontal status between secretors (78% of our population) and non-secretors. furthermore, the occurrence of the monitored micro-organisms was not correlated to the secretor status. it is concluded that bacterial colonization with the micro-organisms tested in this study, apparently occurred independent of secretor status. among the periodontal  pathogens, only p. intermedia was more frequently recovered from the saliva of subjects with interproximal la (49%) than in those without (33%; p = 0.03). this  finding was irrespective of the secretor status. therefore, p. intermedia may be  an important micro-organism in relation to the onset of periodontal destruction in young adults.

TI  == prevalence of periodontitis and suspected periodontal pathogens in families of adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of periodontopathic microorganisms and periodontal destruction in the spouses and children of adult periodontitis patients. for this study, 24 families were selected on the basis of one parent with severe periodontal breakdown and the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and/or porphyromonas gingivalis  and/or more than 30% prevotella intermedia subgingivally. the clinical examination of both parents and children included pocket depth and clinical attachment loss (cal) measurements. samples for bacterial examination were obtained from the mucous membranes, the saliva and pockets. pocket selection was  based on the most advanced periodontitis situation found in a subject. the samples were cultured for the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia. by phase-contrast microscopy, the % of spirochetes  and motile microorganisms was assessed. the number of children within each family varied between 1 and 3. in total 49 children were investigated with a range in age of 3 months to 15 years. results showed that under the age of 5 years, none of the children had cal, whereas in the age group of 5-15 years, 26.5% had 1-5 sites in the primary and/or permanent dentition with 1-3 mm cal. 3 of the spouses had no interproximal cal. 16 of the 24 spouses had a light to moderate form of periodontitis, with at least one site with 1 to 4 mm cal and 5 spouses had severe periodontal breakdown with sites showing at least 8 mm cal. spirochetes, motile microorganisms and p. intermedia were frequently present in all family members. 18 out of the 24 probands were positive for p. gingivalis. this organism was found once only in a 5-year-old boy and in 11 of the spouses. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 13 probands; 5 children and 5 of the spouses were also positive for this bacterium. if a child harboured one of the periodontopathogens, at least 1 of the parents was also positive for that bacterium. this phenomenon may be due to transmission of microorganisms between family members. comparison of the clinical data reported in the present study with similar clinical parameters from epidemiological studies of the dutch population suggest that the spouses and children of adult periodontitis patients  might be at relatively high risk of developing periodontal breakdown.

AB  == in this study, we evaluated the microbiological and clinical effects of mechanical debridement in combination with metronidazole and amoxicillin therapy  in 48 patients with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis, 3 months and at least 24 months after active treatment. the results of this study showed that 47 out of 48 patients were still negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans subgingivally, at the mucous membranes, the tonsillar area and in the saliva, 2 years after therapy. the clinical results showed that a reduction of probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, bleeding index and plaque index was not only seen in the time between baseline and 3 months after therapy, but further clinical improvement was observed between 3 and 24 months after active treatment. we conclude that combined mechanical debridement and metronidazole plus amoxicillin therapy is very effective in suppressing a. actinomycetemcomitans below cultivable levels over a long period of time, suggesting elimination of this organism, and that recolonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be a rare event. the elimination of a. actinomycetemcomitans is paralleled by a further improvement of the periodontal status of the patients, even up to 24 months after active treatment.

TI  == effective method for discriminating between oral bacterial and human alkaline phosphatase activity.
AB  == alkaline phosphatase (alpase) activity was quantitatively compared in various kinds of oral bacteria. high alpase activity was detected in 3 species of periodontal bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga sputigena. the alpase activity detected in these bacteria was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). by contrast, the activity of mammalian alpase isoenzymes was not inhibited at all even in the presence of 1% sds. these results indicate that the alpase assay in combination with 1% sds can identify the origin of alpase detected in gingival crevicular fluid as being from bacteria or from a host response. clinical examination with adult periodontitis revealed that alpase activity in gingival crevicular fluid from the patients consisted of a combination of sds-sensitive and sds-resistant activities. these findings indicate that alpase activity detected in gingival crevicular fluid originates not only from bacteria but also  from a host response.

TI  == modeling the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters and alveolar bone levels in an elderly population.
AB  == a cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. a statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. when only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability  in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. as percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, e. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. the addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2  to 33%. when immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. igg antibody levels to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) a. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. anti-f. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. a total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. when clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of b-lymphocytes  (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-e. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-p. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. the number of enteric bacteria, anti-f. nucleatum levels, and anti-p. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. the r2 for this model was 75%. these results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.

TI  == infection by porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and antibody responses at different ages in humans.
AB  == this study examined the serum igg and igm responses against porphyromonas gingivalis and 3 serotypes of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and the correlations of these responses with age and homologous infection. a total of 90  individuals were included in this study: 40 subjects with gingivitis, 40 periodontally healthy subjects, and 10 adult periodontitis subjects. the subjects in the gingivitis and periodontally healthy groups were divided into 4 stages based on their physiological age: early childhood, school age, puberty, and adult. in the gingivitis group, there was a positive correlation between increase in age and increase in serum igg antibody levels against p. gingivalis until puberty. however, no statistically significant difference was found between the puberty stage and the adult stage. the average level of igg antibodies against a. actinomycetemcomitans in the school age gingivitis group was significantly higher than that in the early childhood gingivitis group for all serotypes (p < 0.01). in serotype c, igg antibody levels in the school age gingivitis group were significantly higher than in the early childhood gingivitis group or the adult gingivitis group (p < 0.01). with both p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans, positive correlations between elevated igg level and infections by these microorganisms were found in the puberty gingivitis and adult periodontitis groups.

TI  == subgingival bacteria in a case of prepubertal periodontitis, before and one year  after extractions of the affected primary teeth.
AB  == the treatment of children with prepubertal periodontitis (pp), may be complicated by the extent of the lesions and the possibility of tetracycline stain of the developing permanent dentition. therefore, with the purpose of preventing the infection of permanent teeth during the mixed dentition, it has been recommended  that the treatment of children with pp, should include the early extraction of the primary teeth affected with alveolar bone loss (abl). still, there is little  evidence which confirms that extraction of the affected primary teeth do in fact  reduce the periodonto-pathogens load of the subgingival plaque. the present study reports values of colony forming units (cfu) of total anaerobic bacteria, actinobacillus actynomicetemcomitans (aa) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) from  the subgingival plaque from a child with pp, collected immediately before and 1 year after extractions of the primary teeth affected with abl. cfu of aa and pg developed only from the subgingival plaque collected before the extraction of the primary teeth affected with abl. these findings suggest that in cases of pp, extraction of the affected primary teeth may reduce the possibility of infection  of the periodontum of the permanent teeth during the mixed dentition period.

TI  == dna probe detection of periodontopathogens in advanced periodontitis.

TI  == a comparison of two transport media for saliva and subgingival samples.
AB  == this study has shown that microorganisms associated with caries (mutans streptococci, lactobacilli) and marginal periodontitis (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in pure culture can be stored in vmga or reduced transport fluid and be recovered sufficiently after 24 h. sufficient recovery after 24 h of mail transport was also obtained in 37 saliva samples obtained from adults and 80 subgingival samples from a group of patients before and 3, 6 and 15 months after periodontal treatment. the samples transported in vmga iii showed in comparison to the samples transported in reduced transport fluid a higher recovery rate as well as a higher percentage of  the total viable count for investigated anaerobic species. this was explained by  the different composition of the two media and also by the gel consistency of vmga iii, which maintains a low redox-potential even during transport after transferring a sample into the medium. in a few samples aerobic bacteria increased in both media.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the survival in 3 transport media of 3  suspected periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. subgingival samples were taken from 10 patients with severe periodontitis, all harboring at least two of the above-mentioned species. the material was dispersed and aliquots were added to vials containing reduced transport fluid, reduced transport fluid containing 10% fildes extract, or viability-maintaining microbiostatic medium, anaerobically prepared (vmga iii). viable counts were determined after 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48 h of  storage at 4 degrees c or at room temperature. the results showed that, for up to 4 h of storage, no significant differences existed for all parameters tested. a large increase of the total viable counts was found in vmga iii at room temperature after 24 and 48 h. this was due to an outgrowth of mainly streptococci. incubation at 4 degrees c yielded often a significantly higher recovery compared to room temperature. after storage at room temperature, the tested bacteria were below detection level in some samples.

TI  == transmission of oral bacterial species between spouses.
AB  == the transmission of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci was studied between 4 married couples who suffered from advanced periodontitis. of the 20 couples investigated, the 4 in which both spouses harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were chosen for the transmission study. three of these couples also harbored mutans streptococci. a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates (8-24 per subject) and mutans streptococcal isolates (5-23 per subject) were serotyped by immunodiffusion technique. for ribotyping, chromosomal dna from a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates (4-5 per subject) and mutans streptococcal isolates (4-11 per subject) was digested with restriction endonucleases clai or bgli and hindiii or smai, respectively. p. gingivalis isolates (2-15 per subject) were ribotyped by using clai, bgli and smai. the blotted restriction fragments were hybridized to the plasmid pkk3535, which contains the rrna operon of the e. coli chromosome. the spouses in 2 couples shared the same sero- and ribotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans. p. gingivalis ribotypes were identical in 2  couples. the result suggests transmission of oral bacteria between spouses.

TI  == bacteriology of dental infections.
AB  == the most common dental diseases, periodontal disease and dental caries, are chronic infections caused by bacteria of normal oral flora. when these bacteria increase in number and irritation exceeds the host defence threshold, disease arises. the human oral flora comprises more than 300 different bacteria. during the last decade approximately 10 species, mainly gram-negative anaerobes, have been noted as putative pathogens in periodontal disease. the gram-positive and facultatively anaerobic mutans streptococci are aetiologically the most important bacteria in dental caries. data have rapidly increased on the association of these bacteria with certain periodontal diseases or caries, on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, pathogenic mechanisms, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and transmission among family members. chronic dental infections have been the focus of renewed interest because of recent advances in oral microbiology as well as in medicine. we now know that in addition to oral streptococci, recently classified, fastidious periodontal anaerobes can be detected from various extra-oral infections. oral bacteria may spread into the blood stream through ulcerated epithelium in diseased periodontal pockets and cause transient bacteraemias, which are regarded as increased risk, especially for immunocompromised patients or persons with endoprotheses. in these patients,  routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for invasive dental care procedures. also the new association between dental infections and myocardial/cerebral infarction have offered new challenges for cooperation between dental and medical researchers.

AB  == the purposes of this study were to determine if: 1) an association exists between cigarette smoking and signs of periodontal disease after controlling for the confounding variables of age, sex, plaque, and calculus; 2) the prevalence of 5 bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease differs between smokers and non-smokers; and 3) the presence of any of these bacteria or smoking are associated with a mean proximal posterior probing depth > or = 3.5 mm. plaque, calculus, gingivitis, and probing depth were measured at the proximal surfaces of all teeth in one randomly selected posterior dental sextant in 615 adults. subgingival plaque was sampled from the same sites and assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum. a subsample of non-smokers (n = 126), who were similar to smokers (n = 63) with respect to age,  sex, plaque, and calculus, was randomly drawn from the original sample. these two groups were then compared on the basis of clinical and microbial parameters. the  results indicated that the odds of having a mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm were 5 times greater for smokers than the non-smoker subsample (odds ratio = 5.3; 95%  ci = 2.0 to 13.8). no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of any of the bacteria was found between smokers and the non-smoker subsample. based on logistic regression analyses of each of the 5 bacteria and smoking, mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm was significantly associated with the presence of a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, and smoking (p < 0.05).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == role of cytokines and inflammatory mediators in tissue destruction.
AB  == colonization or emergence of microbial pathogens may result in tissue destruction by activation of one or more of five distinct host degradative pathways (matrix metalloproteinase pathway, plasminogen-dependent pathway, phagocytic pathway, pmn-serine proteinase pathway and osteoclastic bone resorption) or by direct cleavage of extracellular matrix constituents by microbial proteinases. activation of endogenous destructive pathways may be mediated by immune responses resulting in expression of degradative cellular phenotypes among both immigrant and resident cell populations. in addition, expression of degradative phenotypes  may be triggered by direct influences on host cells of microbial products (lps, enzymes, toxins). a body of evidence suggests that each of these mechanisms involves local production of proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors. the matrix metalloproteinase pathway is centrally involved in dissolution of all unmineralized connective tissues and perhaps in resorption of bone as well. the matrix metalloproteinase family consists of nine or more genetically distinct zn++ endopeptidases which collectively cleave all of the constituents of the extracellular matrix. recent studies have uncovered many essential elements of a  complex, but still incomplete, regulatory network that governs tissue destruction. proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors induce signalling pathways several of which are dependent on protein kinase c and result in transient expression of the transcription factors c-jun and c-fos. initiation of  transcription of most matrix metalloproteinase genes requires binding of the transcription factor ap-1 (c-jun/c-fos) to a specific promoter sequence but attainment of maximal transcription rates is dependent on interaction with other  promoter elements as well. several matrix metalloproteinases have been detected in crevicular fluids and tissues of inflamed human gingiva as have the proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 and tnf-alpha) which regulate their transcription. although the mere presence of enzymes and cytokines does not necessarily impart function per se, these observations suggest that some level of spatial or temporal linkage exists between metalloproteinase/cytokine expression  and gingival inflammation.

TI  == relative avidity of serum antibodies to putative periodontopathogens in periodontal disease.
AB  == elisa was used to determine both the avidity and titre of igg, iga and igm antibodies to the gram-negative anaerobe, porphyromonas gingivalis, in twenty periodontitis patients enrolled in a longitudinal study of attachment loss and eleven non-periodontitis affected subjects. the avidity and titre of igg antibodies to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were also examined. a cross-sectional analysis of the longitudinal patients at baseline and non-periodontally affected controls confirmed earlier findings that igg and iga antibody titres to p. gingivalis were higher in periodontitis patients than in individuals who were not periodontally affected. in this cross-sectional analysis, igg antibody avidities to p. gingivalis were not found to be significantly higher in periodontitis than in control subjects (p = 0.065). however, indications of the potential prognostic value of antibody avidity was demonstrated by the higher igm avidities to p. gingivalis in patients who did not experience attachment loss during the three-month monitoring period than in those who did (p = 0.0005).

TI  == the effect of sibling relationship on the periodontal condition.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to study clinically as well as microbiologically the effect of sibling relationship on the periodontal condition in a young population with a relatively high prevalence of periodontal disease and deprived from regular dental care. in this study, 23 family units consisting  of 3 more siblings were evaluated. in all, 78 subjects aged 15 to 25 years were included in the study. the mean interproximal amount of loss of attachment in this population was 0.29 mm. the individual mean ranged from 0 to 1.27 mm. in 33% of the subjects, > or = 1 sites with a probing depth of 5 mm or more in conjunction with 2 mm of attachment loss were present. the results show a significant sibship effect for: plaque, calculus, loss of attachment, spirochetes on the tongue and in the pocket, porphyromonas gingivalis on the gingiva and in the saliva and prevotella intermedia in the saliva. these results support the hypothesis that periodontitis aggregates in families.

AB  == the distribution and transmission of porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans in 4 families were studied. the families were included, based on the isolation of p. gingivalis from a young child or adolescent. the probands of these 4 families were: a 5-year old periodontally healthy boy; a 17-year old girl with severe generalized juvenile periodontitis; an 11-year old girl with prepubertal periodontitis; 2 sisters, 5 and 17-years old, with untreated severe periodontitis as a component of the papillon-lefevre syndrome. all members of the 4 families were examined clinically and microbiologically for  the presence of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. most of the parents appeared to be adult periodontitis patients; the parents of one proband were edentulous. results showed that in all cases at least one of the parents was positive for p. gingivalis. on the basis of indistinguishable restriction endonuclease patterns (reps) of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates from parents and their children, and distinct reps from unrelated individuals, the present study indicates that p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were transmitted between parents and their children.

TI  == configural frequency analysis for exploring bacterial sets in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == periodontal research has been concerned with identifying bacterial sets in oral health and disease. configural frequency analysis (cfa) is a taxonomical method used to test the statistical significance of patterns of elementary cell frequencies in cross-tabulated data, and may therefore be used to evaluate interactions among occurrences and non-occurrences of periodontal microorganisms. cfa patterns may exist as configural types or anti-types depending on whether observed cell frequencies are greater or less than expected frequencies, respectively, based on table marginals. cfa was applied to two published data sets. in the first, the occurrence of bacteroides (porphyromonas) gingivalis (bg) and treponema denticola (td) was studied in military subjects. analysis of individual cells of the resultant two-by-two contingency table revealed the existence of a single anti-type (td in the absence of bg) suggesting a sequential phenomenon. the second, more complex, data set was based on reported occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), bg, and bacteroides (prevotella) intermedius (bi) in sites with and without progressive periodontitis. cfa based on all data identified three statistically significant configural types and two anti-types. however, a somewhat different configurational picture emerged when disease progression status was considered a stratification variable for separate  analysis. all these analyses, which were undertaken for expository purposes, assumed independence of observations. methodological procedures are suggested for cfa when observations are not independent.

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. although a specificity to some degree is found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. what we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate  and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. this hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in ljp patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. suspected pathogens (risk markers) are actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of prevotella intermedia, bacteroidesforsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. the presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, staphylococcus aureus and candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and aids--or with implants.

AB  == serum igg, iga and igm and salivary iga antibody levels reactive with extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eubacterium  saburreum and streptococcus mutans, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay in samples from 12 persons before, during and after experimental gingivitis. the participants refrained from cleaning their teeth until 50% of their gingival units showed bleeding after gentle probing, but not longer than 15 days. samples were taken from serum and saliva, before and during the period of experimental gingivitis, and up to 8 weeks after the start of the experiment. a pattern with minor fluctuations in specific serum and salivary antibody activities was consistently found in all patients. this indicates that immunoregulatory mechanisms succeed in maintaining unchanged antibody levels when plaque load increases. a subgroup of participants with low mean numbers of bleeding gingival units after plaque accumulation, showed significantly higher salivary iga antibody levels reactive with s. mutans, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. saburreum, as compared with the subgroup reaching high bleeding after probing scores (p < 0.05). when 1 person with outlying values (p < 0.05) for p. gingivalis was excluded from the tests, the former group also showed statistically significant higher salivary antibody levels to this bacterial species. high levels of salivary iga directed against bacteria in dental plaque might thus protect against the development of gingivitis.

TI  == macaca nemestrina: a non-human primate model for studies of periodontal disease.
AB  == the non-human primate macaca nemestrina was evaluated for use as a potential model in periodontal research by study of 16 animals. using one incisor, premolar, and molar per quadrant, we measured supragingival plaque, severity of gingival inflammation, and pocket depth, and analyzed the subgingival flora. serum igg titers and avidities to antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were also assessed. ten animals were between 13 and 24 years old, and six were between 4 and 5 years old. while mean gingival inflammation scores were significantly higher for older than for younger animals (2.2 vs 1.8, p < 0.05), mean plaque index scores and mean probing depths  did not differ significantly. the animals harbored a subgingival microflora considered to be pathogenic for humans including aa, pg, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia i and ii, campylobacter recta and fusobacterium nucleatum.  aa, however, was found only in the younger animals. all of the animals had serum  igg antibodies reactive with antigens of pg and aa, and titers for pg but not for aa were significantly higher in the older relative to the younger animals (t test p < 0.02). in contrast, antibody avidity did not significantly differ between the two groups. a combined clinical assessment index based on maximum probing depth,  gingival index score, and tooth loss was used to assess the overall disease severity. titers were positively associated with disease severity (spearman's rank correlation 0.57, p = 0.02).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == short-term sequential administration of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium and doxycycline in the treatment of recurrent/progressive periodontitis.
AB  == the systemic use of a single antibiotic was compared to that of a sequential antibiotic regimen in the treatment of a. actinomycetemcomitans and/or p. gingivalis-associated periodontitis. eleven patients with recurrent/progressive periodontitis and demonstrating subgingival infection with a.a. and/or p.g. were  selected. six patients received oral administration of doxycycline (do), 200 mg the first day and 100 mg for 4 days thereafter, and then amoxicillin/clavulanate  potassium (au), 500 mg 3 times daily for 5 days. the other 5 patients received only doxycycline for 10 days. eight sites with > or = 5 mm probe depth per patient were selected, of which 4 received root planing at time 0. clinical measurements (gi and pi, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, and bleeding upon probing/suppuration) and microbial infection levels (2 sites/patient as per dna probe) for a.a. and p.g. were recorded at 0, 4, 12, and  25 weeks. clinical data were subjected to statistical analysis of variance and t-tests for significance. the do + au groups produced significant reduction in probing pocket depth (ppd) at 4, 12, and 25 weeks (1.1, 1.3, and 1.1 mm, respectively). the do group produced significant reduction in ppd only at 4 and 12 weeks (0.8 and 0.8 mm); the do + au group produced significant gain of 0.8 mm  in probing attachment level at 4 and 12 weeks; and the do + au group in conjunction with root planing produced the most sustained reduction in ppd and gain in pal. these findings suggest that the sequential use of multiple antibiotic agents may offer greater promise as an adjunctive treatment approach for the management of recurrent and/or progressive periodontitis than a single antibiotic regimen.

TI  == bacterial mediators in periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontal disease is the general description given to the inflammatory response of the gingiva and underlying connective tissue to bacterial accumulations (dental plaque) on the teeth. a limited number of cultivable species are usually  associated with periodontal disease. the majority of putative periodontal pathogens are gram-negative anaerobic rods. some of the characteristics of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola will be discussed, given their prominence in the literature. these organisms share the ability to penetrate the gingival epithelium, such that their endotoxins, immunologically active compounds, and cytotoxic enzymes and molecules are presented directly to the host's inflammatory cells. this ability may be what distinguishes these gram-negative species from the plethora of other gram-negative species that inhabit the subgingival plaque. in addition, these organisms tend to be selected for in disease-associated plaques, suggesting that  their nutritional needs are met when the gingival crevicular fluid contains a variety of inflammatory mediators and products of tissue breakdown. a. actinomycetemcomitans produces a leukotoxin, and the immunologic response of the  host to this antigen may explain the unique pattern of tooth involvement in localized juvenile periodontitis. both p. gingivalis and t. denticola have a trypsin-like enzyme that could be a virulence factor, primarily because this enzyme(s) may allow these organisms to grow in the presence of the inflammatory response of the host.

TI  == sensitization of periodontopathogenic bacteria to killing by light from a low-power laser.
AB  == cultures of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans were treated with a range of photosensitizers and then exposed to light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon laser for up to 80 s. toluidine blue o (25 micrograms/ml) and methylene blue (25 micrograms/ml) were effective lethal photosensitizers of all 3 target organisms, enabling substantial light dose-related reductions in viable counts. dihaematoporphyrin ester and aluminium  disulphonated phthalocyanine were lethal photosensitizers only of p. gingivalis.  in the absence of a photosensitizer, exposure to laser light had no significant effect on the viability of the cultures. if such low doses of light (22 j/cm2) are effective at killing bacteria in vivo, the technique may be useful as a means of eliminating periodontopathogenic bacteria from diseased sites.

TI  == lethal photosensitization of bacteria in subgingival plaque from patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples from patients with chronic periodontitis were exposed  to light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon laser for 30 s in the presence and absence of  50 micrograms/ml toluidine blue o as a photosensitizer. viable counts of various  groups and species of bacteria were carried out before and after irradiation. the median numbers of viable bacteria initially present in the 30-microliters aliquots irradiated were 1.13 x 10(5) cfu (aerobes), 4.08 x 10(5) cfu (anaerobes), 4.92 x 10(3) cfu (black-pigmented anaerobes), 4.75 x 10(2) cfu (porphyromonas gingivalis), 6.15 x 10(3) cfu (fusobacterium nucleatum) and 1.7 x  10(4) cfu (streptococci). the dye/laser combination achieved significant reductions in the viability of these organisms, the median reductions in the viable counts being 91.1% for aerobes, 96.6% for anaerobes, 100% for black-pigmented anaerobes, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum and 94.2% for streptococci. overall, the viability of bacteria in the 20 plaque samples was not significantly decreased by the dye alone. however, in a small minority of samples there were indications of light-independent, dye-induced toxicity. low-power lasers, in conjunction with appropriate photosensitizers, may be a useful adjunct to mechanical debridement in the treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases if a similar effectiveness against subgingival plaque bacteria can be achieved in vivo.

TI  == demonstration of the glycocalyces associated with three oral gram-negative bacterial species using a modern acrylic resin technique.
AB  == the complex highly hydrated chemical composition of the bacterial glycocalyx renders it difficult to preserve and visualize at the ultrastructural level. polyanionic stains such as ruthenium red help to maintain some structural integrity, and other more modern approaches include antibody stabilization, lectins, and the addition of lysine to the primary fixative. it has been suggested that the glycocalyx of certain disease-associated organisms may play a  role in the pathogenesis of some microbially based diseases such as periodontitis. new, more adequate, modern methodologies are therefore required for the further study of this structure. in the present study a cold dehydration  process in conjunction with lr white acrylic resin has been employed to study the glycocalyces of three oral gram-negative bacterial species reported to be periodontopathogens. when compared with organisms processed conventionally and with ruthenium red, the organisms processed by the cold dehydration and lr white  method demonstrated a fibrous matrix that was not seen in the other specimens. these results indicate that a combination of reduced dehydration temperature and  cold acrylic resin embedding provides the best methodology for the visualization  of the fine structure of the bacterial glycocalyx. this approach may be particularly useful in the study of organisms within specific disease-associated  environments such as the periodontal pocket.

TI  == the effects of acacia arabica gum on the in vitro growth and protease activities  of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of acacia gum was assessed using fresh isolates and reference strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. a fine aqueous suspension of gum was produced by sonication and then a soluble fraction  isolated by centrifugation and membrane filtration. these preparations were incorporated into columbia agar at doubling concentrations. growth of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia cultures on the agar was inhibited by whole gum sonicate at concentrations of 0.5-1.0% w/v. both species showed reduced susceptibility when horse blood was present in the agar. the gum soluble fraction did not inhibit growth of any bacterial culture. the effect of acacia on bacterial proteases was examined with cell sonicates from log phase broth cultures. enzyme activities were determined by fluorimetric assay with various synthetic peptide substrates. most protease activities reduced in the presence of 0.5% w/v gum sonicate, with the trypsin-like activities of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia proving most sensitive. the gum soluble fraction was nearly always less inhibitory than the sonicate. the action of acacia gum against suspected periodontal pathogens and their enzymes suggests that it may be of clinical value.

TI  == local and systemic antibody response to putative periodontopathogens in patients  with chronic periodontitis: correlation with clinical indices.
AB  == specific immunoglobulin g (igg), iga and igm antibody titres to porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum and gingival crevicular fluid at 5 sites in each of 20 chronic periodontitis patients. specific serum antibody titres correlated with mean gingival crevicular fluid titres. the 3 immunoglobulin subclass responses (iga, igg and igm) to p. gingivalis correlated. a comparison of sites with probing depth < 4 mm and > or = 4 mm showed that the latter group had significantly lower gingival crevicular fluid igg titres to p. gingivalis. sites with a gingival index of 3 had significantly lower gingival crevicular fluid igg titres to this organism than those with a gingival index of  less than 3. these findings support the concept that the humoral immune response  is protective, as chronic periodontitis patients with greater pocket depths and more gingival inflammation had paradoxically lower antibody titres to suspected periodontopathogens.

TI  == agglutination of streptococcus mutans serotype c cells but inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis autoaggregation by human lactoferrin.
AB  == the ability of various forms of human lactoferrin (lf) to agglutinate oral streptococcus mutans, strep. sobrinus, strep. rattus, strep. sanguis, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells was studied spectrophotometrically. fe3+ saturated lf was unable to agglutinate these bacteria, whereas iron-free lf (apo lf) effectively agglutinated strep. mutans cells but not the other bacteria. the efficiency and rate of agglutination of strep. mutans were somewhat lower with apo lf than with human whole saliva. however, secretory iga, phosphate and whole saliva almost totally abolished the apo lf-mediated agglutination of strep. mutans, suggesting binding to the same target sites on bacterial cell surfaces, or to each other. the presence of exogenous iron (fe2+, fe3+), lactoperoxidase or serum albumin did not affect the  agglutination by apo lf. low ca2+ (50-100 microns) slightly enhanced the agglutination by apo lf but higher concentrations (0.5-1.0 mm) totally blocked the apo lf-mediated agglutination of strep. mutans. both saliva and apo lf significantly delayed the rapid autoaggregation of p. gingivalis cells. aggregation of p. gingivalis is considered a potential virulence factor and a protective mechanism against the host's cellular defences in the gingival crevice. these findings show a novel, strain-specific antibacterial mechanism for lf against strep. mutans and p. gingivalis and adds a new compound to the group of agglutinating proteins in human saliva.

TI  == higher-titer antisera from patients with periodontal disease inhibit bacterial capsule-induced bone breakdown.
AB  == solubilized surface-associated material (sam) from a number of periodontopathogenic bacteria have been shown to be potent stimulators of bone resorption in vitro in the murine calvarial bone culture assay. antibodies to the constituents of sam are also found in patients with periodontal diseases. serum from patients with severe generalized periodontitis (sgp) containing high titers  of antibodies to the sam of porphyromonas gingivalis completely inhibited the bone resorption induced by sam from this organism. in contrast, serum from patients with low titers of antibodies to sam from p. gingivalis failed to inhibit bone resorption. high-titer sera (containing antibodies to sam from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) were added to calvarial cultures stimulated with sam from a.  actinomycetemcomitans. of 6 high-titer sera tested, only 4 inhibited bone breakdown, the other 2 sera having no effect on resorption. low-titer sera were also ineffective at blocking bone resorption. this suggests that the antibody response to sam may have a protective effect in patients with periodontal disease.

TI  == analysis of immunodominant antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis 381 in high responder patients.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the immunodominant antigens of p. gingivalis 381 and to examine their composition and molecular weight. fourteen periodontal patients, with high antibody titers to p. gingivalis 381 sonicated extract, were selected. whole cell fraction, sonicated extract and outer membrane protein of p. gingivalis 381 were used as antigens in the untreated form as well  as in the heated form and treated with papain. total volume of sugar, protein and lipopolysaccharide (lps) was estimated in each one of the three antigens. antibody binding capacity to the three antigens was evaluated, before and after heat and papain treatment, by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). in addition, the immunoblotting analysis was performed. the quantitative assays showed that the whole cell fraction contained about ten times more lps than the other two preparations while the outer membrane protein contained twice the amount of carbohydrates than the other two preparations. the 14 sera were classified into three groups according to the rate of reduction of antibody binding under heat and papain treatment. concerning heat treatment, most of the sera showed a high reduction of antibody binding when reacting with the sonicated extract. however, antibody binding to the outer membrane protein antigen was hardly decreased by heat treatment in three sera. also, these three sera showed almost the same response to the whole cell fraction antigen under heat treatment. under papain treatment, almost all sera showed a moderate reduction of antibody binding when they reacted with the sonicated extract and whole cell fraction while they showed a low reduction of antibody binding when they reacted with the  outer membrane protein. from the present study it could be concluded that a main  proteinaceous antigen of p. gingivalis was recognized by the majority of the patients suggesting that the proteinaceous portion is an important part of the antigen, while some patients seemed to recognize the lps or carbohydrate as the antigenic determinant.

TI  == microbiological and clinical monitoring of non-localized juvenile periodontitis in young adults: a report of 11 cases.
AB  == it has been shown that patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) often harbor actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival area. however, little is known of the oral microflora in non-ljp juvenile periodontitis patients with less extensive disease. the purpose of this study was to describe the microflora and clinical parameters of young adults with minor to moderate periodontitis during treatment for a period of 1 year. eleven patients 15 to 16 years of age were studied. all of them had 4 to 8 mm loss of attachment at minimally one site, but the typical clinical description of localized juvenile periodontitis was an exclusion criterion in this study. microbiological examination of the deepest periodontal pocket and of the tongue revealed that 6 patients harbored actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 5 harbored porphyromonas gingivalis. almost all subjects showed relatively high proportions  of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, motile organisms, and spirochetes. on the basis of clinical and microbiological parameters the 11 patients could be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. six cases had moderate periodontal breakdown with loss of attachment at 7 to 44 sites. all harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans and 5 of them p. gingivalis. these 6 cases responded relatively well to initial treatment despite the continued presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the other group consisted of 5 cases with relatively minor periodontal breakdown; i.e, 1 or 2 sites with 4 to 6 mm loss of attachment. neither a. actinomycetemcomitans nor p. gingivalis was detected in the deepest pocket of these patients. all 5 responded well to initial treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == monoclonal antibodies to lipopolysaccharide of four oral bacteria associated with periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontal disease is a common inflammatory disease which erodes the supporting  structures of the teeth, and is initiated by a subgingival infection with selected gram-negative bacteria. monoclonal antibodies (mab) to lipopolysaccharide (lps) of four periodontal pathogens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis were examined for specificity and their ability to bind these pathogens in a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (pcfia). the mab selected were specific for their homologous bacteria and when tested against a large battery of other bacteria, including 16 genera and 46 species, were found not to cross-react with heterologous species. when each of the mab was challenged with 40 or more homologous freshly isolated bacteria, more than 90% were positive. non-cellular antigens in the form of soluble lps and extracellular vesicles were examined for their ability to bind to assay components and alter the apparent results of the assay. lps was found to have potential as an interfering agent if bound to assay components prior to sample treatment, but this non-specific binding was significantly reduced when a  surfactant was added to the buffers. extracellular vesicles had no significant effect on the estimation of p. gingivalis by the assay.

AB  == nutrient uptake may contribute to the survival of certain potential periodontopathogens in the competitive environment of the gingival sulcus. this study was conducted to assess the uptake of commercially available, key radiolabelled phosphorylated compounds by treponema denticola. there was a linear relationship in the uptake of atp and g-1-p with cell concentrations of 0.1-2.5 mg of cell dry weight. this uptake reached a steady state within 15 min, and at temperatures of 25-37 degrees c the uptake ranged between 13-21%. at 50 degrees c, or above 50 degrees c the assay cells took up 0-1% of the assay nutrients. the maximum uptake of atp was 47.5, 38 and 47.6 pmoles for serovars a, b and c. g-1-p yielded maximum uptake values of 306, 304, and 306 pmoles respectively. significant uptake of atp, or g-1-p occurred at ph 4.8 for serovars a, or c, while serovar b showed a broad ph range for the uptake of g-1-p. stannous fluoride at a concentration of 0.17 mm enhanced the uptake of atp while chlorhexidine digluconate inhibited the uptake of atp. at concentrations usually  employed (0.05-0.5 mm) the metabolic poisons 2,4-dinitrophenol, sodium azide, sodium arsenite and the atpase inhibitor n,n1-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide did not alter significantly the uptake of atp. the uptake of atp, by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and t. denticola at ph 4.8 was 13.4, 1.5, 6.9, and 18-20.4%, respectively. at ph 6.5 the uptake for the microorganisms indicated above was 22, 1.3, 6.6 and 6.2%, respectively. g-1-p showed the same trend in its uptake by a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. denticola. this study provides for the first time specific examples of phosphorylated nutrient uptake by potential periodontopathogens, and that the uptake of phosphorylated nutrients can be suppressed by oral hygienic compounds.

TI  == characteristics and utilization of antibody measurements in clinical studies of periodontal disease.
AB  == the detection and quantitation of immune responses to infections have long been used as a diagnostic tool in medical infections. recently, increasing evidence has supported that active, specific antibody responses to selected members of the subgingival microbiota are noted in periodontitis patients. this report describes the various specificities of this antibody as they relate to periodontitis classification and prognosis. the functional aspects of the serum antibody have come under increasing scrutiny to understand better the potential immunologic mechanisms acting in the periodontium. data are available that describe opsonizing potential, complement fixing ability, blocking functions, and anti-toxic capacity for the antibody. longitudinal alterations in specific antibody levels are shown to relate to infection and accompany changes in the burden of a specific microorganism in the subgingival plaque. thus, these antibody changes could be useful indicators of altered host-parasite interactions that presage a disease-active episode. finally, studies were designed to examine  the ability of antibody to reflect the effects of treatment on the disease. the results indicated that specific antibody levels change with mechanical, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory treatments. the findings described in this report suggest that evaluation of the level and specificity of serum antibody can be a beneficial adjunct in designing and implementing clinical studies delineating the initiation, progression, and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == dna probe and enzyme analysis in periodontal diagnostics.
AB  == recent research in periodontology has indicated that a finite number of bacterial species are associated with periodontal disease. this has generated the hypothesis that periodontal disease is essentially an infection due to one or more of the putative periodontopathogens; i.e., the specific plaque hypothesis (sph). this microbial specificity paradigm has already changed the way researchers and some clinicians view periodontal disease. the clinician must heed several cautions signs, however, if he is to use the sph to provide treatment options that could enhance the delivery of care. there are several diagnostic technologies that can be used to detect and semi-quantitate those bacterial species that have been identified as periodontopathogens. this paper discusses diagnostic tests based upon the detection in plaque of dna segments or enzyme activity(ies) that are unique for one or more of the suspected periodontopathogens.

AB  == a bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (bcfia) was developed to rapidly detect periodontopathic bacteria in human plaque samples. the bcfia utilized fluorescent-tagged monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against the lipopolysaccharide of selected gram-negative bacteria. microorganisms identified  in plaque using the bcfia included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the immunoassay procedure involved combining a patient's plaque sample with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mab and then incubating the mixture in a specialized microtiter plate allowing the mab to bind to its homologous bacteria. bound and unbound fluorescent-tagged mabs were separated by  filtration and total bound bacterial fluorescence was determined with a fluorimeter. the relative number of a bacterial species in a given plaque sample  was estimated by reference to a standard curve carried through the bcfia. the bcfia had a lower detection limit of near 10(4) specific bacterial cells in a mixed bacterial preparation or plaque sample. when compared to cultivable flora procedures in detecting the 4 periodontopathogens, the bcfia had high levels of statistical sensitivity, 97% to 100%, while statistical specificity ranged between 57% and 92%. there was a 71% to 82% agreement between bcfia and dna probe methodology in detecting periodontopathogens in plaque. the bcfia, when compared  to cultivable flora, offers the advantage of evaluating both live and dead bacterial cells in plaque. this may in part, if not fully, explain the lower specificity values of the bcfia when compared to cultivable flora. screening plaque samples for periodontopathic bacteria is considerably faster and results in a greater frequency of detection with bcfia than cultivable flora based methods.

TI  == expression of fc-gamma-riii and fibronectin in peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils with increased response to fc stimulation in patients with juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the nature of increased luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (cl) in peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) in juvenile periodontitis is of pathophysiological interest and may serve as a model for tissue damage caused by  granulocytes. activation of pmns by opsonized staphylococcus aureus was compared  with that of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides gingivalis, regarded as being more specific for juvenile periodontitis. the cl was higher in  the pmns from the patients, independently of bacteria and mode of opsonization (autologous serum or gamma-globulin). fc-gamma-riii assessed on the washed fragments from peripheral pmns was significantly (p < or = 0.005) lower in the patients with juvenile periodontitis than in their pair-matched healthy controls, while the content of fibronectin was higher (p < or = 0.032). however, when fc-gamma-riii and fibronectin were studied in fresh pmns by flow cytometry no difference could be found between the two groups. the increased generation of cl  of peripheral pmns found in patients with juvenile periodontitis seems to be independent of humoral factors and of bacterial species and may be related to the properties of the pmn cell membranes.

TI  == heterogeneity of surfaces of subgingival bacteria as detected by zeta potential measurements.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) are gram-negative bacteria which are implicated in various forms of periodontal disease. the gram-positive peptostreptococcus micros may also play an important role. for investigation of the possible adhesion and colonization mechanisms of these organisms, the charge properties of the outermost layers of bacterial cell surfaces were studied through the measurement  of zeta potentials at various ph values. eleven fresh clinical isolates, representing the four species, and one laboratory strain, p. gingivalis w83, were examined. eleven of the 12 strains displayed heterogeneity with respect to ph-dependent zeta potentials. within single cultures of each of these strains, two distinct populations of cells were found, one which was more negatively charged than the other. for the gram-negative strains, the more negatively charged subpopulation was in the majority, while the p. micros strains appeared to be composed mainly of a less-negatively-charged subpopulation. vesicles prepared from two strains displayed the same ph dependence and heterogeneity of zeta potentials as the parent cells. an a.a. strain which was passaged several times in fluid medium had lost its fimbriae and became homogeneous with respect to charge.

TI  == sensitization of oral bacteria in biofilms to killing by light from a low-power laser.
AB  == biofilms of streptococcus sanguis, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were prepared on the surfaces  of agar plates and a number of compounds were screened for their ability to sensitize bacteria in these biofilms to killing by light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon (he/ne) laser. toluidine blue o and methylene blue enabled detectable killing of all four target organisms after exposure to he/ne light for 30 s. aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine, haematoporphyrin hcl and haematoporphyrin ester were effective photosensitizers of only some of the target organisms. these findings suggest that lethal photosensitization may be an effective means of eliminating periodontopathogenic bacteria from dental plaque.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in the shallow pockets of immigrants from developing countries.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of typical periodontitis-associated microorganisms in refugees arriving from non-industrialized countries, and to relate the presence of these organisms to the periodontal condition of the subjects. thirty males between 35-44 years of age were surveyed. dental plaque, calculus, gingivitis, loss of attachment, and probing depths were recorded for all surfaces. a total of 90 microbiological samples were taken with paper points from mesial sites of teeth 16, 36 and 41. microbiological test sites were grouped by probing depths and loss of attachment. only 16.8% of all surfaces had probing depths > 3 mm, although 90.7% of surfaces  had loss of attachment > 1 mm. twenty-one sites with obvious periodontal destruction (pd > 3 mm, la > 2 mm) showed the greatest recovery of porphyromonas  gingivalis (66.7%). however, 51 sites with minimal periodontal disease (pd < or = 3 mm, la < 2 mm) and with no gingival recession also showed a relatively high detection frequency of p. gingivalis (34.1%). twenty-four of these samples came from 12 patients with no pockets > 5 mm and with less than 10% of all sites yielding pockets > 3 mm. the detection frequencies of prevotella intermedia (91.6%), bacteroides forsythus (25.0%), wolinella spp. (33.3%) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (50.0%) were similar in these sites compared with periodontitis sites. morphologically distinct isolates, from 19 individuals positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, were serotyped by indirect immunofluorescence.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative clinical and microbiological effects of topical subgingival application of metronidazole 25% dental gel and scaling in the treatment of adult periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of the study was to compare the clinical and microbiological effects of topical application of a metronidazole gel and a single session of subgingival scaling in the treatment of adult periodontitis. an open, randomized controlled clinical study design was employed. each of 24 subjects received the 2 treatments simultaneously each in 2 randomly selected quadrants of the dentition. the metronidazole, 25% gel was applied subgingivally on days 0 and 7. scaling was carried out in one quadrant on day 0 and in one quadrant on day 7. clinical and microbiological examinations were carried out before treatment and on days 21, 49, 91, 133, and 175 of the experimental period. the microbiological analyses included determination of total anaerobically cultivable bacteria, and relative proportions of anaerobes, aerobes, black-pigmented anaerobic gram negative rods,  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococci, and spirochetes. both treatments were effective in reducing probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing. metronidazole tended to be a little better than scaling during the study period and the clinical effects of both treatments persisted during the whole 6 months observation period. local metronidazole treatment induced a significant and long-lasting shift in the subgingival flora towards a composition more compatible with health and comparable to that obtained by mechanical debridement. proportions of black pigmented anaerobes including prevotella intermedia, and the number of spirochetes were significantly reduced after both treatments with a concomitant increase in the proportions of streptococci. while scaling resulted in a statistically significant increase in the proportion of a. actinomycetemcomitans, this was avoided after metronidazole treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the aim of the present study was to elucidate the interrelationship between cigarette smoking and the occurrence of periopathogens, i.e., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius. the study was based on 145 patients with clinically severe periodontitis, 52 men (age range 32-73 years) and 93 women (age range 32-74 years). 83 patients were smokers (> or = 15 cigarettes/day) and 62 non-smokers. bacterial samples were collected from one site with a probing depth > or = 6 mm for each individual. there were no statistically significant differences in bacterial counts between smokers and non-smokers (p > 0.05). the relative frequencies of smokers and non-smokers positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 31% and 31%, for b. gingivalis 42% and 44%, and for b. intermedius 65% and 53%, respectively. the differences between smoking groups were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). the occurrence in different combinations of these bacteria was also determined. there were no statistically significant differences between smoking and combinations of periopathogens (p > 0.05). the results suggest that smoker and non-smoker patients do not differ with regard to occurrence, relative frequency or different combinations of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. gingivalis and b. intermedius.

TI  == longitudinal monitoring for disease progression of localized juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the present study was performed to investigate the factors associated with disease progression in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients by longitudinal monitoring of microbiological changes. following a 9-month period, 9 ljp patients were divided into 2 groups based upon attachment loss, progressing and non-progressing. both groups received scaling, root planing, and modified widman flaps. clinical and microbiological data were obtained at baseline, following the observation period, and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. at 6 and 12 months post-treatment significantly more cocci were persistent in the non-progressing group than in the progressing group. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was also more frequently isolated in the progressing group  than in the non-progressing group initially and following the 9-month observation period. also after treatment, a. actinomycetemcomitans recolonized earlier in the progressing group than in the non-progressing group. these studies suggest that a. actinomycetemcomitans may play a role in disease progression in ljp; however,  they do not eliminate the possibility that other organisms may also play a role,  since a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in all of the patients in whom disease progressed.

AB  == the easily solubilized surface-associated material from three bacterial species associated with periodontal diseases, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens, produced dose-dependent inhibition of thymidine incorporation by human fibroblasts, the human monocytic cell line u937 and guinea pig epidermal cells. in contrast, lipopolysaccharides from a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were either inactive or substantially less active over the dose range tested. one of the constituents of  surface-associated material from a 'non-leucotoxic' strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans was highly cytotoxic to human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells, with 50% killing from less than 1 ng/ml. a constituent of the surface-associated material from p. gingivalis was approximately one log order less active. the lipopolysaccharides from these bacteria were at least three log orders less active in neutrophil killing. these findings add weight to  the hypothesis that easily solubilized exopolymers from periodontopathogens play  a major part in the pathology of periodontal diseases.

TI  == synergistic effect of pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == our previous studies have shown that pyrophosphate (ppi), the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, inhibits the growth of organisms associated with coronal and root surface caries. the purposes of this investigation were to: 1) determine if periodontal pathogens are similarly susceptible to the growth-inhibitory properties of ppi; and 2) determine if combinations of pyrophosphate-sodium dodecyl sulfate (ppi-sds) inhibit growth synergistically. porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus (formerly  wolinella recta) were cultured in appropriate enriched media under anaerobic conditions. inhibition assays were performed in tubes containing media supplemented with ppi and/or sds. a range of concentrations of ppi and sds in 2-fold increments was employed, with each concentration assayed in triplicate. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) analyses revealed all of the bacteria were susceptible to ppi and sds, with mics of 0.67% (25 mm) and 0.01% w/v respectively. combination studies with ppi-sds showed much greater growth inhibition against p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans than achieved with  the agents individually. determination of fractional inhibitory concentration indices indicated a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect. under the constraints of the conditions employed, these studies demonstrate the efficacy of ppi-sds combinations in inhibiting the growth of periodontal pathogens. it is conceivable that these compounds may have clinical benefit as a subgingival irrigant.

AB  == the purpose of the study was to validate the epsilometer test (e-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms  using the agar dilution method as a standard. the e-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. the device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential  gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. after 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (ic) of the antibiotic. twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. a total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. the antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. as a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the  agar dilution method. mics were compared with ics determined using the e-test method. the results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. the e-test ics for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and  the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ics for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution mics.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == it is generally believed that supragingival plaque control has little effect on the subgingival microflora of deep periodontal pockets. however, this may not be  true for moderately deep pockets (4-5 mm), which may represent a pathological state between gingivitis and marginal periodontitis. in 6 patients with poor oral hygiene and severe gingival inflammation, 4 matched sites (1 in each quadrant), were chosen which demonstrated at least 20% spirochetes and 15% black-pigmented gram-negative bacilli. during the first 12 weeks (phase 1), supragingival calculus was removed from the right half of the mouth and then the teeth were professionally cleaned three times a week. at the beginning of phase 2, supragingival calculus was also removed from the left quadrants and the entire mouth was subjected to the same protocol used in phase 1. at no time did patients receive oral hygiene instructions. clinical parameters were assessed and microbiological samples were taken at 3-week intervals. samples were submitted to darkfield microscopy and anaerobic culturing. analysis by multiple linear regression and the wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed significant changes in the  composition of the subgingival microbiota at cleaned sites. while gram-positive organisms increased proportionally, a number of putative periodontal pathogens, such as p. gingivalis and spirochetes decreased.

AB  == the peri-implant space was examined for the presence of periodontitis-related microorganisms in 19 patients. all patients had been fitted with osseointegrated  titanium implants which were clinically sound at the time of examination and all  had been prescribed daily 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthrinse. in 17 patients, two contralateral fixtures in patients were selected, the remaining 2 patients had only one fixture, and associated mucosal clinical variables assessed for plaque accumulation, gingival inflammation, bleeding tendency, and probing depth. the bacteriological composition of submucosal plaque samples was investigated using non-selective media and selective media for actinobacillus actimomycetemcomitans  (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and prevotella intermedia (pi). the peri-implant tissues were healthy. twenty-two of 37 sites had a greater proportion of anaerobes than aerobes. aa was detected at one site. pg was not cultivated, and pi was present in 7 of 37 sites, comprising between 0.4% and 60.9% of the total anaerobic viable counts. since the presence of any of these organisms may play a contributory role to the loss of the fixture, it is recommended that the submucosal plaque of implants be monitored regularly for the presence of these periodontitis-associated species.

TI  == comparison of various detection methods for periodontopathic bacteria: can culture be considered the primary reference standard?
AB  == the development of diagnostic tests for a periodontal infection raises the issue  as to what the appropriate reference standard, or "gold standard," should be for  the evaluation of a new test. the present research was initiated to compare the ability of several detection methods, i.e., a serial dilution anaerobic culture and/or microscopic procedure, a dna probe procedure, and immunological reagents using both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples taken from 204 periodontally diseased tooth sites. the prevalence  of the four monitored species varied as a function of both the species and the detection method. spirochetes were present in 99% of the plaques, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected at the lowest frequency. the culture method yielded the lowest prevalence values for the three cultivable species. this raised the question as to which results, those obtained by culture or those obtained by the dna probes and the immunological reagents, were the most reliable. this issue was addressed by looking at the prevalence profile of the monitored organisms, as determined by all the detection methods. if the species was detected by three or four of the detection methods, then it was considered present, whereas if it was absent by three or four of the detection methods, then it was considered absent. this approach showed the dna probes and immunological reagents to be significantly superior (p less than 0.05) to the culture approach  for the detection of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus and to be comparable to the microscopic approach in the detection of t. denticola.

TI  == the use of dna probes to examine the distribution of subgingival species in subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction.
AB  == the present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. the mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). the probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. the % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; v. parvula, 98; b. intermedius i, 98; s. sanguis ii, 96; b. intermedius ii, 95; c. ochracea, 94; b. gingivalis, 91; s. sanguis i, 85; w. recta, 83; f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; s. intermedius, 80; b. forsythus, 76; p. micros, 74; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and  a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. the % of sites colonized by each of the  14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. the median number  of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for v. parvula. in half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than  4%. when subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == humoral antibody responses in periodontal disease.
AB  == several forms of periodontal disease are considered to be infectious diseases with associated specific bacteria. this study examined the humoral antibody levels as assayed by elisa to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in adult periodontitis (ap), localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp), and in periodontally healthy subjects (hs). sixty-two of the 64 (96.9%) patients had significantly elevated antibody levels to at least one of the three organisms. elevated levels of antibodies to p. gingivalis occurred in 82.8% of the rpp, ljp, and ap patients with all 3 disease groups showing greater responses than hs controls. antibodies to a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 59.4% of the rpp,  ljp, and ap patients and were significantly higher in both ljp and rpp patients.  only 21.9% of the rpp, ljp, and ap patients showed elevated levels to p. intermedia with only significantly higher levels in the rpp and ljp groups. antibodies to a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. intermedia were rarely found alone  (only 5.1% and 2.6% of the patients respectively) but were usually accompanied by p. gingivalis. these results suggest that one or more combinations of these 3 bacteria may play a role in the pathogenesis of these forms of periodontal disease.

TI  == periodontal bone loss in mice induced by different periodontopathic organisms.
AB  == periodontal bone loss in mice orally inoculated with peptostreptococcus anaerobius, pept. magnus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was compared to that in sham-inoculated mice. six-to-8-week-old balb/c mice were inoculated with  1 x 10(5), 1 x 10(7) or 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units (c.f.u.) of bacteria in 50 microliters of medium. ten mice received each concentration of bacteria and 10 sham-inoculated mice acted as controls. five mice from each of the groups were killed 6 weeks after inoculation and the remaining five mice at 12 weeks. right hemimandibles were defleshed, stained and bone loss was measured using an image analyser. all the organisms tested were associated with bone loss. animals that had received pept. anaerobius and pept. magnus had up to 18% more bone loss than  those sham inoculated. in contrast, mice inoculated with a. actinomycetemcomitans had up to 38% more bone loss than the sham-inoculated animals, this amount of loss occurring at the lowest inoculation of 1 x 10(5) c.f.u. these data demonstrate a differential ability of micro-organisms to cause periodontal bone loss in mice.

TI  == putative periodontopathogens in "diseased" and "non-diseased" persons exhibiting  poor oral hygiene.
AB  == the aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of some putative periodonto-pathogens in "test" and "control" sites in "diseased" and "non-diseased" persons, respectively, from an adult rural kenyan population exhibiting poor oral hygiene and widespread loss of attachment (la). 14 persons (less than 35 years) were assigned to a "diseased" category on the basis of at least 4 sites with la greater than or equal to 4 mm; at least 5 mm la and a pocket greater than or equal to 4 mm interproximally in a lower incisor ("test" site): and less than 2 mm la and no pocket greater than or equal to 4 mm distal to a lower canine or mesial to a lower first premolar ("control" site). age-matched "non-diseased" persons were identified on the basis of no sites with  la greater than 2 mm and no pockets greater than or equal to 4 mm associated with la. paperpoint samples from test and control sites as well as a scraping sample from the dorsum of tongue were examined for presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, b. melaninogenicus group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas spp., and wolinella recta. p.  gingivalis was found in 79% of test sites and 36% of control sites in "diseased"  persons, and in 18% and 35% of test and control sites, respectively, in "non-diseased" persons. "no other bacterial group discriminated significantly between test and control sites or between diseased and non-diseased subjects. the surprisingly high occurrence of p. gingivalis in non-diseased subjects, both subgingivally and on tongue, indicates that deep periodontal pockets are not prerequisite ecological environments for p. gingivalis establishment.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

TI  == microbiological and clinical results of metronidazole plus amoxicillin therapy in actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis.
AB  == we report on the microbiological and clinical effects of mechanical debridement in combination with metronidazole plus amoxicillin therapy in 118 patients with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis. patients were categorized into 3 groups: 28 had localized periodontitis; 50 had generalized periodontitis, and 40 had refractory periodontitis. after initial treatment and metronidazole plus amoxicillin therapy 114 of 118 (96.6%) patients had no detectable a. actinomycetemcomitans. significant reduction in pocket probing depth and gain of clinical attachment were achieved in almost all patients. four  patients were still positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans after therapy. metronidazole resistance (mic greater than 25 micrograms/ml) was observed in 2 of 4 strains from these patients. patients still positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis showed a significant higher bleeding tendency after therapy. it was concluded that mechanical periodontal treatment in combination with the metronidazole plus amoxicillin therapy is effective for subgingival suppression of a. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with severe periodontitis.

TI  == gingival crevicular fluid concentration and side effects of minocycline: a comparison of two dose regimens.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to conduct a direct comparison of two dose regimens of minocycline to determine 1) whether they achieved crevicular fluid concentrations in a therapeutic range; and 2) the frequency of side effects. in a double-blind design, 30 patients divided into 2 groups were given either 100 mg minocycline or 200 mg minocycline per day for an 8-day period. the concentration  of minocycline in the gingival clevicular fluid (gcf) at 8 days was 4.77 micrograms/ml for the 100 mg a day group and 5.97 micrograms/ml for the 200 mg a  day group and at 15 days was 4.30 micrograms/ml for the 100 mg a day group and 4.17 micrograms/ml for the 200 mg a day group. there was no significant difference in the antibiotic concentration in the gingival crevicular fluid between the 2 groups. reported adverse experiences to the minocycline were greater in the 200 mg a day group. short-term changes in periodontal health as measured by plaque index, gingival index, pocket depth, and bleeding upon probing showed improvements in all parameters over the 15 day period. there were no significant differences in these parameters between the 100 mg a day and 200 mg a day group. at 8 days reduced levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were achieved but they were not eliminated from infected subgingival sites in either group. achieving bacteriostatic concentrations of gcf, fewer side effects, and the potential for better compliance suggests that a single daily dose of 100 mg minocycline should now be investigated for its efficacy in managing periodontal infections manifesting as periodontitis.

TI  == the effect of 3 mouthrinses on plaque and gingivitis development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 3 mouthrinses, listerine antiseptic (thymol), peridex (chlorhexidine), perimed (povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide), and a placebo (water) on the development of dental plaque and gingivitis, when used as the only oral hygiene procedure for 14 days. 71 subjects were entered into a randomized, double-blind study. at the baseline examination,  papillary bleeding score (pbs), and plaque index (pi) were registered, after which subjects received supragingival prophylaxis and were assigned to 1 of 4 study cells. subjects were asked to refrain from all oral hygiene procedures except for the supervised 14-day 2 x daily rinsing with the assigned preparation. at day 14, the same clinical parameters were again registered. statistical analysis was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (anova) to compare the 4 groups, followed by duncan's multiple range test to determine specific group differences. at baseline, average pbs and pi scores were similar for all 4 groups. after 14 days, the average pbs for peridex and perimed was significantly  lower than for listerine antiseptic and water. the frequency of interdental units with a pbs greater than 2 was significantly lower for peridex and perimed than for listerine antiseptic and water. we concluded that both peridex and perimed were effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis when used as a 2 x daily mouthrinse by subjects refraining from other oral hygiene procedures. in vitro, a synergistic effect was assumed when inhibition was achieved with perimed at the same or greater dilution than was achieved with povidone-iodine alone.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dental implant metals.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the specific in vitro antibacterial effect of seven dental implant metals on oral bacteria which have often been identified in failing implants. the metals chosen for evaluation were titanium, chromium, cobalt, aluminum, iron, gold, and vanadium. these metals were selected  because they are contained in many commonly used dental implants. the bacteria selected for this study included isolates of porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaniogenica, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. sets of tubes containing either supplemented trypticase soy broth, brain-heart infusion-yeast extract, or brain-heart infusion-yeast extract with 5  percent defibrinated rabbit blood were aseptically prepared with doubling dilutions of the seven metals starting at an initial concentration of 500 micrograms/ml and terminating at 0 microgram/ml. cultures of each organism were inoculated into each set of broth tubes containing all concentrations of metals.  tubes were incubated either anaerobically or in an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide for 48 hours at 35 degrees c and then assayed for atp content which was proportional to the viable cellular biomass. the results showed that, although being bacteria and concentration dependent, all seven metals suppressed the growth of each organism. the rank order of antibacterial activity expressed by dental implant metals was gold > titanium > cobalt > vanadium > aluminum > chromium > iron.

TI  == relation of counts of microbial species to clinical status at the sampled site.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to relate clinical characteristics at a site to the frequency of detection, absolute counts and proportions of 14 subgingival species. subgingival plaque samples were removed by curette from the  mesial surface of 2299 teeth in 3 healthy and 87 subjects with periodontal attachment loss. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to identify colonies of each test species. measurements of pocket depth, attachment level, recession, redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration were made at each sampled site. total viable  counts at sites ranged from 10(3) to greater than 10(8) and were strongly related to pocket depth. mean total counts at sites less than 3 mm averaged 4.6 x 10(6),  while mean counts at sites greater than 7 mm averaged 2.0 x 10(7). species enumerated and % of sites colonized were as follows; v. parvula 44; s. sanguis ii 36; b. intermedius i 33; c. ochracea 31; b. intermedius ii 30; s. sanguis i 29; b. gingivalis 27; s. intermedius 25; p. micros 24; w. recta 23; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 18; b. forsythus 15; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 10; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 8. counts of b. intermedius ii were higher at sites which exhibited gingival redness while b. intermedius i was higher at sites which bled on probing. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b was more frequent and  at higher mean % at sites without recession. the opposite was true for s. sanguis ii. b. gingivalis was somewhat more prevalent and at higher levels at suppurating sites. b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii and b. forsythus were found more frequently and at higher levels at sites with deeper pockets, while v. parvula was less prevalent at sites with pocket depths less than 4 mm. b. gingivalis, b.  intermedius i and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b increased with increasing pocket depth in both localized and widespread disease subjects, but mean counts were higher in the localized disease subjects at any pocket depth. only w. recta  was found at higher levels at deep sites in widespread disease subjects when compared with similar sites in localized disease subjects. no suspected pathogens were detected in 38% of shallow sites, 31% of intermediate sites and 22% of deep  sites, 2/3 of deep pockets, but less than 1/2 of shallow pockets harbored at least 2 of the suspected pathogens.

TI  == clinical and microbiological patterns of adults with periodontitis.
AB  == although current data suggest that periodontitis may actually be multiple diseases each with varying responses to therapy, little evidence exists to support this theory in adult patients. this report describes the design and initial findings of a longitudinal field trial involving the diagnosis and treatment of adult and refractory periodontitis patients in private practice. adult patients (n = 221) who met specific clinical criteria were selected from the private practices of 22 periodontists. clinical characteristics were recorded and subgingival plaque samples were sent to microbiology laboratories at either ucla or the university of texas health science center at san antonio (uthscsa). samples were processed according to protocols standardized between the 2 centers. five different combinations of the initial clinical and microbial findings were evaluated for patterns in the data by means of cluster analysis. plaque, bleeding on probing, bone loss scores, probing depth distributions, and microbial findings produced multiple cluster solutions. solutions involving 6 clusters explained 39.4% to 76.4% of the variation between patients and produced ratios for variation between clusters to variation within clusters of 5.2 to 15.3. the optimal cluster solution incorporated both clinical and microbial findings, with  some clusters characterized by high plaque and moderate bleeding on probing and bone loss, whereas others had low plaque but high bleeding on probing and bone loss. microbial findings of each cluster exhibited distinct patterns with some clusters having a high prevalence (83% to 100%) of specific target bacterial species while other clusters had an absence of these species.(abstract truncated  at 250 words)

TI  == fluorescence immunoassay for detecting periodontal bacterial pathogens in plaque.
AB  == a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay has been modified into a bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (bcfia) to rapidly detect periodontopathic bacteria in human plaque samples. the bcfia utilizes fluorescently tagged monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against the lipopolysaccharide of selected gram-negative plaque bacteria. microorganisms closely associated with periodontal disease that can be identified in plaque with the bcfia include porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens. briefly, the procedure involved mixing a patient's plaque sample or other bacterial preparation with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mab in a specialized microtiter plate. this mixture was incubated to allow binding of the mab to its homologous bacteria. the bound and unbound fluorescent tagged mabs were separated by filtration in the modified microtiter plate, and the total bacterial bound fluorescence was determined with  a fluorimeter. the number of a specific bacterial species in a given plaque sample or other bacterial suspension was estimated by reference to a primary standard carried through the bcfia. the lower detection limit of the bcfia was 10(3) to 10(4) bacterial cells from single cultures of bacteria or 10(4) bacterial cells in mixed cultures. the coefficient of variation within and between plates for each of the five bacterium-specific mabs in screening plaque for the periodontal pathogens was less than 10%. these results demonstrate that microbes in plaque can be used as the solid phase in the bcfia to detect and quantitate mabs associated with specific bacteria quickly and reliably.

TI  == microbiology of subgingival plaque from children with localized prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  == localized prepubertal periodontitis has been described as a host-defect mediated  form of bacterially induced periodontitis, with an early onset and rapid progression around a few teeth in children prior to puberty. to further our understanding of the etiology of this disease, we have examined the microbiological components of subgingival dental plaque in 9 children with localized prepubertal periodontitis to determine if patterns of putative pathogens existed, and have compared these results with those obtained from 4 children with no periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were plated onto a selective medium for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and onto a non-selective medium for anaerobes, and the predominant cultivable microbiota of  2 sites per child was determined. the subgingival microbiota of children with localized prepubertal periodontitis clearly differs from non-diseased children in the detection of high levels of several suspected pathogens, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga sputigena. these putative pathogens were found in various combinations. these findings suggest that localized prepubertal periodontitis is  associated with specific subgingival bacteria which are generally not found in children without periodontitis.

TI  == suspected periodontopathic microorganisms and their oral habitats in young children.
AB  == samples of subgingival plaque from 67 children, 5-7 years of age, were examined for the presence of certain suspected periodontal pathogenic species using the conventional technique of anaerobic sonification, dilution and spiral plating. when this technique was compared with a direct plating procedure which involved no preliminary dispersion and dilution of plaque specimens, it was found that the direct method resulted in double the frequency of children in whom black-pigmented bacteroides (bpb) were detected and a 10-times increase in the number of subjects harbouring actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. samples from  the tongue, tonsils and saliva were also plated using the direct technique. bpb were detected less commonly in the plaque specimens (61.3% of children) than in saliva (89.5%), or on the tongue (86.6%) and tonsils (97.1%). expressed as percentages of a pooled sample of the total bpb population, the most frequently detected species in plaque were bacteroides intermedius (44.4%) and bacteroides melaninogenicus (48.0%). the most prevalent isolate in all other oral sites was b. melaninogenicus. expressed as percentages of children in whom bpb were detected, the most frequently isolated species from plaque using the conventional dilution technique was b. intermedius (21.3%), whereas other bpb species were present in fewer than 5% of children. fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga  species were isolated most frequently from plaque but were also commonly detected in the various other oral sites.

AB  == recent microbiological studies of periodontal disease in humans have supported the concept of a specific bacterial etiology. while individual agents have not been unequivocally identified, numerous gram-negative members of the subgingival  microflora have been implicated. in addition, elevations in systemic antibody responses have been consistent with certain oral microorganisms being involved in an infectious process associated with the disease. this report delineates the relationship between elevated systemic antibody levels and oral colonization with the homologous microorganism at active disease sites. thirty-four patients with various types of periodontal disease were examined. using elisa, each patient was shown to have an elevated antibody response to at least one organism from a battery of 18 oral microorganisms that were tested. subsequently, subgingival plaque was cultured from disease-active and -inactive sites of each subject. the  results demonstrated that the same microorganism to which the individual exhibited elevated serum antibody responses was detected in nearly 55% of the disease-active sites, while only 18% of the inactive sites showed the microorganism. certain microorganisms including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, eikenella corrodens and wolinella  recta were primarily or exclusively correlated with active disease lesions. these findings support the hypothesis that elevated systemic antibodies to periodontopathic bacteria are reflective of subgingival colonization and exist as a response to a bacterial infection at disease-active sites.
