TI  == is sinusitis innocent?- unilateral subdural empyema in an immunocompetent child.
AB  == subdural empyema related to streptococcus constellatus is extremely rare in an immunocompetent child, and also there is no reported case along with staphylococcus lugdunensis infection. although streptococcus constellatus has been determined as a co-pathogen with anerobic bacteria in many infections, it has not been reported in combination with staphylococcus lugdunensis. the authors describe a case of previously healthy 16-y-old child with unilateral subdural empyema due to these bacteria. sinusitis was the only predisposing factor in the  index case. the authors propose that some cases of culture-negative intracranial  infections may be due to these infectious agents. therefore, these agents should  be considered as causes of intracranial infection in persistent complaints such as fever and headache after sinusitis in children. it is important to treat them  with effective antibiotics and early surgical intervention for favorable outcome, because fatal cases were reported due to streptococcus constellatus infections.

TI  == development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == background: dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. the principal method of prevention  is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. in-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. the aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the calgary biofilm device (cbd) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. the specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. results: pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. a mean of 320 and 250 otus were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm  samples, respectively. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. in addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (amova). there were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (amova, p < 0.002). pcoa revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (amova, p < 0.001). veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant otus detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst prevotella oralis, v. parvula and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. conclusions: diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the cbd. biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. this model could be used to screen  both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == a case of odontogenic infection by streptococcus constellatus leading to systemic infection in a cogan's syndrome patient.
AB  == odontogenic infection in immunocompromised patients tends to extend systemically  beyond the oral cavity. our case report presents a patient with sepsis due to a streptococcus constellatus (s. constellatus) odontogenic infection in a 64-year-old-immunocompromised woman with cogan's syndrome. she had been suffering from chronic mandibular osteomyelitis which was thought to have been caused by dental caries and/or chronic periodontitis with furcation involvement of the left mandibular first molar. we suspect that the acute symptoms of the chronic osteomyelitis due to s. constellatus led to the systemic infection. this infection could be accelerated by the use of a corticosteroid and an alendronate. this is the first report which represents the potential association between odontogenic infection and cogan's syndrome.

TI  == pelvic peritonitis during biologic therapy for rheumatoid arthritis: a case report and review of the literature.
AB  == introduction: infections are recognized as major complications during therapy with biologics and other immunosuppressant drugs. the respiratory tract, bone, joint, skin, and soft tissues are well known sites of infection in patients with  rheumatoid arthritis (ra) treated by biologics or other immunosuppressants. it is known that patients with intra-abdominal infections may develop tuberculous peritonitis during biologic therapy. however, non-tuberculous pelvic peritonitis  is rare. case description: a case of a 46-year-old patient with ra developed pelvic peritonitis during therapy with mtx, tacrolimus (tac), and golimumab (glm). the patient visited our hospital due to a fever and general malaise. physical findings included lower abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness. abdominal computed tomography (ct) images showed an intrauterine foreign body and ascites. the contraceptive ring was removed. streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus constellatus were cultured from the removed contraceptive ring. she was started on an antimicrobial agent, flomoxef (fmox), at 2 g/day. the fmox dosage was increased to 3 g/day from the 3rd day of disease and continued for 10  days. her fever disappeared from the 4th disease day, and her inflammatory response then gradually decreased. no exacerbation of symptoms occurred even after the fmox treatment was stopped, and the patient was discharged on the 14th  disease day. discussion and evaluation: mtx and biologics were being administered at the time of onset of peritonitis. the peritonitis was diagnosed on the basis of the gynecological evaluation and ct imaging findings that were typical of peritonitis. the patient was in an immunosuppressed state during administration of anti-rheumatic drugs, and the peritonitis was thought to have developed due to an ascending infection via the long-term presence of the intrauterine contraceptive ring which had an attached string. conclusions: before starting biological agents, patients must be questioned regarding the presence of an intrauterine foreign body.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of periodontal streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius clinical isolates.
AB  == background: streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius in subgingival dental plaque biofilms may contribute to forms of periodontitis that  resist treatment with conventional mechanical root debridement/surgical procedures and may additionally participate in some extraoral infections. because systemic antibiotics are often used in these clinical situations, and little is known of the antibiotic susceptibility of subgingival isolates of these two bacterial species, this study determined the in vitro susceptibility to six antibiotics of fresh s. constellatus and s. intermedius clinical isolates from human periodontitis lesions. methods: a total of 33 s. constellatus and 17 s. intermedius subgingival strains, each recovered from separate patients with severe chronic periodontitis (n = 50) before treatment, were subjected to antibiotic gradient strip susceptibility testing with amoxicillin, azithromycin,  clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and doxycycline on blood-supplemented mueller-hinton  agar and to the inhibitory effects of metronidazole at 16 mg/l in an enriched brucella blood agar dilution assay. clinical and laboratory standards institute and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing interpretative standards were used to assess the results. results: clindamycin was the most active antibiotic against s. constellatus (minimum inhibitory concentration at 90% [mic90] 0.25 mg/l), and amoxicillin was most active against s. intermedius (mic90 0.125 mg/l). a total of 30% of the s. constellatus and s. intermedius clinical isolates were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, 98% were only intermediate in susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, and 90% were resistant to metronidazole at 16 mg/l. conclusion: subgingival s. constellatus and s. intermedius exhibited variable antibiotic susceptibility profiles, potentially complicating empirical selection of periodontitis antibiotic therapy in patients  who are species positive.

TI  == streptococcus constellatus community acquired pneumonia with subsequent isolated  pulmonic valve endocarditis and abscess formation in a structurally normal heart.
AB  == pulmonic valve infective endocarditis in isolation is a rare clinical entity. the formation of an abscess in the right ventricular outflow tract as a consequence of vegetations affecting the pulmonic valve in a structurally normal heart is extremely rare and has not been reported. we report a case of isolated pulmonic valve endocarditis complicated by a regional abscess formed within the right ventricular outflow tract caused by streptococcus constellatus (s. constellatus), a member of the streptococcus milleri group in a young male whose risk factor was alcohol abuse and he was treated medically, a comprehensive literature review on  the subject is also reported. our case is the first reported in literature with infective endocarditis caused by s. constellatus affecting the pulmonic valve, and the first with pulmonic valve endocarditis and perivalvular abscess formation in a structurally normal heart.

TI  == [a case report of gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the small intestine presenting with liver abscesses caused by streptococcus constellatus].
AB  == a 49-year-old woman visited a local hospital in october 2007 with complaint of fever and melena. abdominal ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography revealed an irregular mass in the lower abdomen, together with multiple masses in the liver. she was admitted because of anemia, and the high fever was determined  to be an inflammatory response. blood tests revealed elevated biliary enzyme levels. percutaneous biopsy of the liver mass was performed, which revealed liver abscesses caused by streptococcus constellatus. on abdominal angiography, the mass was suspected to be a tumor of the small intestine. in late november 2007, laparoscopy-assisted partial small bowel resection was performed, and pathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed gastrointestinal stromal tumor (gist) of the small bowel. because reports of small intestinal gist with liver abscesses caused by streptococcus constellatus are rare, this case description could provide valuable information.

TI  == development of species-specific quantitative real-time pcr primers for detecting  anginosus group streptococci based on the rpob.
AB  == in this study, we introduced species-specific quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) primers designed based on a dna-dependent rna polymerase beta-subunit gene for detecting anginosus group streptococci (ags), streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. intermedius. the specificity of the qpcr primers was confirmed by conventional pcr with the genomic dnas of 76 strains regarding 44 bacterial species including the type strain for the target species. the standard  curves revealed the lower detection limits of these species-specific qpcr primers was 40 fg at below a cycle threshold (ct) value of 35. these results suggest that ags species-specific qpcr primers are suitable for applications in epidemiological studies associated with infectious diseases related to ags.

TI  == identification of the 'streptococcus anginosus group' by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization--time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) provides rapid, accurate and cost-effective identification of a range of bacteria and is rapidly changing the face of routine diagnostic microbiology. however, certain groups of bacteria, for example streptococci (in particular viridans or non-haemolytic streptococci), are less reliably identified by this method. we studied the performance of maldi-tof ms for identification of  the 'streptococcus anginosus group' (sag) to species level. in total, 116 stored  bacteraemia isolates identified by conventional methods as belonging to the sag were analysed by maldi-tof ms. partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, supplemented with sialidase activity testing, was performed on all isolates to provide 'gold standard' identification against which to compare maldi-tof ms performance. overall, 100 % of isolates were correctly identified to the genus level and 93.1  % to the species level by maldi-tof ms. however, only 77.6 % were correctly identified to the genus level and 59.5 % to the species level by a maldi-tof ms direct transfer method alone. use of a rapid in situ extraction method significantly improved identification rates when compared with the direct transfer method (p<0.001). we recommend routine use of this method to reduce the  number of time-consuming full extractions required for identification of this group of bacteria by maldi-tof ms in the routine diagnostic laboratory. only 22 % (1/9) of streptococcus intermedius isolates were reliably identified by maldi-tof ms to the species level, even after full extraction. maldi-tof ms reliably identifies s. anginosus and streptococcus constellatus to the species level but does not reliably identify s. intermedius.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel secreted glycosidase with multiple glycosidase activities in streptococcus intermedius.
AB  == streptococcus intermedius is a known human pathogen and belongs to the anginosus  group (s. anginosus, s. intermedius, and s. constellatus) of streptococci (ags).  we found a large open reading frame (6,708 bp) in the lac operon, and bioinformatic analysis suggested that this gene encodes a novel glycosidase that  can exhibit beta-d-galactosidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-hexosaminidase activities. we, therefore, named this protein "multisubstrate glycosidase a" (msga). to test  whether msga has these glycosidase activities, the msga gene was disrupted in s.  intermedius. the msga-deficient mutant no longer showed cell- and supernatant-associated beta-d-galactosidase, beta-d-fucosidase, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase, and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase activities, and all phenotypes were complemented in trans with a recombinant plasmid carrying msga. purified msga had all four of these glycosidase activities and exhibited the lowest km with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminide and the highest kcat with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked beta-d-galactopyranoside. in addition, the purified lacz domain of msga had beta-d-galactosidase and beta-d-fucosidase activities, and the gh20 domain exhibited both n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase activities. the beta-d-galactosidase and beta-d-fucosidase activities of msga are thermolabile, and the optimal temperature of the reaction was 40 degrees c, whereas almost all enzymatic activities disappeared at 49 degrees c. the optimal temperatures for the n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase activities  were 58 and 55 degrees c, respectively. the requirement of sialidase treatment to remove sialic acid residues of the glycan branch end for glycan degradation by msga on human alpha1-antitrypsin indicates that msga has exoglycosidase activities. msga and sialidase might have an important function in the production and utilization of monosaccharides from oligosaccharides, such as glycans for survival in a normal habitat and for pathogenicity of s. intermedius.

TI  == molecular pathogenicity of streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus and the closely related species streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius, are primarily commensals of the mucosa. the true pathogenic potential of this group has been under-recognized for a long time because of difficulties in correct species identification as well as  the commensal nature of these species. in recent years, streptococci of the s. anginosus group have been increasingly found as relevant microbial pathogens in abscesses and blood cultures and they play a pathogenic role in cystic fibrosis.  several international studies have shown a surprisingly high frequency of infections caused by the s. anginosus group. recent studies and a genome-wide comparative analysis suggested the presence of multiple putative virulence factors that are well-known from other streptococcal species. however, very little is known about the molecular basis of pathogenicity in these bacteria. this review summarizes our current knowledge of pathogenicity factors and their regulation in s. anginosus.

TI  == an unusual case of streptococcus anginosus group pyomyositis diagnosed using direct 16s ribosomal dna sequencing.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the streptococcus anginosus group (streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus anginosus) are capable  of causing serious pyogenic infections, with a tendency for abscess formation. the present article reports a case of s anginosus group pyomyositis in a 47-year-old man. the pathogen was recovered from one of two blood cultures obtained from the patient, but speciation was initially not performed because the organism was considered to be a contaminant (viridans streptococci group). the diagnosis was ultimately confirmed using 16s ribosomal dna sequencing of purulent fluid obtained from a muscle abscess aspirate. the present case serves to emphasize that finding even a single positive blood culture of an organism belonging to the s anginosus group should prompt careful evaluation of the patient for a pyogenic focus of infection. it also highlights the potential utility of 16s ribosomal dna amplification and sequencing in direct pathogen detection from aspirated fluid in cases of pyomyositis in which antimicrobial therapy was initiated before specimen collection.

TI  == a streptolysin s homologue is essential for beta-haemolytic streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus cytotoxicity.
AB  == streptococcus constellatus is a member of the anginosus group streptococci (ags)  and primarily inhabits the human oral cavity. s. constellatus is composed of three subspecies: s. constellatus subsp. constellatus (scc), s. constellatus subsp. pharyngis and the newly described subspecies s. constellatus subsp. viborgensis. although previous studies have established that scc contains beta-haemolytic strains, the factor(s) responsible for beta-haemolysis in beta-haemolytic scc (beta-scc) has yet to be clarified. recently, we discovered that a streptolysin s (sls) homologue is the beta-haemolytic factor of beta-haemolytic streptococcus anginosus subsp. anginosus (beta-saa), another member of the ags. furthermore, because previous studies have suggested that other ags species, except for streptococcus intermedius, do not possess a haemolysin(s) belonging to the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, we hypothesized that, as with beta-saa, the sls homologue is the beta-haemolytic factor of beta-scc, and therefore aimed to investigate and characterize the haemolytic factor of beta-scc in the present study. pcr amplification revealed that all of the tested beta-scc strains were positive for the saga homologue of scc (saga(scc)). further investigations using beta-scc strain w277 were conducted to elucidate the relationship between saga(scc) and beta-haemolysis by constructing saga(scc) deletion mutants, which completely lost beta-haemolytic activity. this loss of beta-haemolytic activity was restored by trans-complementation of saga(scc). furthermore, a co-cultivation assay established that the cytotoxicity of beta-scc was clearly dependent on the presence of saga(scc). these results demonstrate that saga(scc) is the factor responsible for beta-scc beta-haemolysis and cytotoxicity.

TI  == constant high adrenal fdg uptake in pet/ct associated with mitochondrial disease.
AB  == we describe a patient with the m.3243a>g mitochondrial dna mutation who developed sepsis caused by streptococcus constellatus. in the acute phase of illness, abnormally high uptake of (18)f-fdg was observed in both adrenal glands that appeared anatomically normal. in repeated imaging six months later the adrenal uptake had diminished but remained clearly elevated. we did not observe high adrenal fdg uptake as in the patient described here among 30 patients with staphylococcus aureus sepsis that were investigated with identical imaging protocol. in sepsis, oxygen consumption and metabolic rate are increased compared to normal metabolism. the observed high adrenal fdg uptake during sepsis in this  patient probably reflects the acute metabolic stress induced by the infection. interestingly, in repeated imaging six months later, the adrenal suvs had diminished but were still abnormally high: this suggests constant high levels of  metabolic stress associated with the mitochondrial disorder.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == phylogenetic relationship and virulence inference of streptococcus anginosus group: curated annotation and whole-genome comparative analysis support distinct  species designation.
AB  == background: the streptococcus anginosus group (sag) represents three closely related species of the viridans group streptococci recognized as commensal bacteria of the oral, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. the sag also cause  severe invasive infections, and are pathogens during cystic fibrosis (cf) pulmonary exacerbation. little genomic information or description of virulence mechanisms is currently available for sag. we conducted intra and inter species whole-genome comparative analyses with 59 publically available streptococcus genomes and seven in-house closed high quality finished sag genomes; s. constellatus (3), s. intermedius (2), and s. anginosus (2). for each sag species, we sequenced at least one numerically dominant strain from cf airways recovered during acute exacerbation and an invasive, non-lung isolate. we also evaluated microevolution that occurred within two isolates that were cultured from one individual one year apart. results: the sag genomes were most closely related to  s. gordonii and s. sanguinis, based on shared orthologs and harbor a similar number of proteins within each cog category as other streptococcus species. numerous characterized streptococcus virulence factor homologs were identified within the sag genomes including; adherence, invasion, spreading factors, lpxtg cell wall proteins, and two component histidine kinases known to be involved in virulence gene regulation. mobile elements, primarily integrative conjugative elements and bacteriophage, account for greater than 10% of the sag genomes. s. anginosus was the most variable species sequenced in this study, yielding both the smallest and the largest sag genomes containing multiple genomic rearrangements, insertions and deletions. in contrast, within the s. constellatus and s. intermedius species, there was extensive continuous synteny, with only slight differences in genome size between strains. within s. constellatus we were able to determine important snps and changes in vntr numbers that occurred over the course of one year. conclusions: the comparative genomic analysis of the sag  clarifies the phylogenetics of these bacteria and supports the distinct species classification. numerous potential virulence determinants were identified and provide a foundation for further studies into sag pathogenesis. furthermore, the  data may be used to enable the development of rapid diagnostic assays and therapeutics for these pathogens.

TI  == invasive streptococcus anginosus group infection-does the species predict the outcome?
AB  == objective: to determine whether there is an association between the species of streptococcus anginosus group (sag) bacteria and the clinical outcome. methods: isolates from invasive infections caused by sag bacteria at our institution between january 2004 and february 2009 were identified phenotypically to the taxonomic level of species. clinical data from the medical records of the patients from whom these isolates were recovered were obtained retrospectively and analyzed. results: patients with invasive streptococcus intermedius infections had a significantly longer hospital stay than patients infected with s. anginosus (p = 0.024) and a significantly higher 30-day all-cause mortality than patients infected with streptococcus constellatus (p = 0.049). conclusion: identification of sag bacteria to the taxonomic level of species may be of prognostic importance.

TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == periocular necrotizing fasciitis causing blindness.
AB  == importance: periocular necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but potentially devastating disease, accompanied by high rates of morbidity and mortality. observations: we report 5 cases of periocular necrotizing fasciitis resulting in  severe vision loss, 3 of which required exenteration to contain the disease and only 1 of which recovered vision. three cases were caused by group a streptococcus; 1, by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; and 1, by streptococcus anginosus constellatus. conclusions and relevance: providers should maintain a high clinical suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis and distinguish it from more common forms of cellulitis. as seen in these 5 cases, periocular necrotizing fasciitis may cause severe visual loss more often than previously recognized. to our knowledge, this is also the first report of streptococcus anginosus constellatus causing necrotizing fasciitis.

TI  == a case of prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by streptococcus constellatus as a rare agent of endocarditis.
AB  == we present a case of prosthetic valve endocarditis, which was caused by a rare etiological agent, streptococcus constellatus. in our case, transesophageal echocardiography showed a large and broad abscess formation throughout the patient's aortic prosthetic valve ring and left atrium. despite specific intravenous antibiotic therapy, the infection was uncontrollable, and the patient underwent surgical treatment. the pathogen rarely causes endocarditis, but it is  known to have a strong potential to form abscess, and therefore its infection may be more serious than other streptococcus species. our case seems to be the first  report of surgical treatment of pve caused by s. constellatus. as in our case, transesophageal echocardiography is useful for the detection of vegetation and abscess, and early cardiac surgery may be a more appropriate therapeutic approach for endocarditis caused by s. constellatus.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == identification, clinical aspects, susceptibility pattern, and molecular epidemiology of beta-haemolytic group g streptococcus anginosus group isolates from central taiwan.
AB  == no literature is available on the prevalence and clinical aspects of beta-haemolytic group g streptococcus anginosus group in central taiwan. in this  study, we used 16s rrna gene sequencing and 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer sequencing (where necessary) as the gold standard for molecular identification. twenty-seven s. anginosus group isolates were identified from 273 beta-haemolytic ggs isolates collected from patients in central taiwan between february 2007 and  august 2011. of the 27 isolates, 22 were s. anginosus and 5 were streptococcus constellatus. the 3 commercial methods, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, and vitek 2 gp card, identified 77.8%, 40.7%, and 37.0% of s. anginosus group isolates, respectively, with acceptable %id or probability level. all the s. constellatus isolates possessed the lmb gene (encoding laminin-binding protein);  however, none of the s. anginosus isolates possessed this gene. all the 27 isolates were susceptible to penicillin. five s. anginosus group isolates (18.5%) were resistant to erythromycin. the resistance genes, ermb and mefa, were detected in 3 (2 s. anginosus and 1 s. constellatus) and 2 (2 s. anginosus) isolates, respectively. pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that most s. anginosus group isolates were genetically diverse. this is the first study to evaluate 3 commercial methods for the identification of beta-haemolytic group g s. anginosus group species, and only the rapid id 32 strep system showed considerable ability. the clinical aspects, susceptibility pattern, and molecular epidemiology of beta-haemolytic group g s. anginosus group isolates from central  taiwan were also first presented.

TI  == identification of beta-haemolysin-encoding genes in streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus is an emerging pathogen, but little is known about its virulence factors. to detect the genes responsible for beta-haemolysis we performed genomic mutagenesis of the beta-haemolytic s. anginosus type strain atcc 12395 using the vector pghost9:iss1. integration site analysis of 15 non-haemolytic mutants identified a gene cluster with high homology to the genes  of the streptolysin s (sls) encoding sag gene cluster of s. pyogenes. the gene cluster harbours 10 open reading frames displaying significant similarities to the s. pyogenes genes saga-sagi, with the identities on protein level ranging from 38 to 87%. complementation assays of s. anginosus sagb and sagd integration  mutants with the respective genes confirmed their importance for beta-haemolysin  production and suggest the presence of post-translational modifications in s. anginosus sls similar to sls of s. pyogenes. characterization of the s. anginosus haemolysin in comparison to the s. pyogenes sls showed that the haemolysin is surface bound, but in contrast to s. pyogenes neither fetal calf serum nor rna was able to stabilize the haemolysin of s. anginosus in culture supernatants. inhibition of beta-haemolysis by polyethylene glycol of different sizes was carried out, giving no evidence of a pore-forming haemolytic mechanism. analysis  of a whole genome shotgun sequence of streptococcus constellatus, a closely related streptococcal species that belongs to the s. anginosus group, revealed a  similar sag gene cluster. employing a genomic mutagenesis strategy we were able to determine an sls encoding gene cluster in s. anginosus and demonstrate its importance for beta-haemolysin production in s. anginosus.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human peri-implantitis microbiota.
AB  == objectives: because antimicrobial therapy is often employed in the treatment of infectious dental implant complications, this study determined the occurrence of  in vitro antibiotic resistance among putative peri-implantitis bacterial pathogens. methods: submucosal biofilm specimens were cultured from 160 dental implants with peri-implantitis in 120 adults, with isolated putative pathogens identified to species level, and tested in vitro for susceptibility to 4 mg/l of  doxycycline, 8 mg/l of amoxicillin, 16 mg/l of metronidazole, and 4 mg/l of clindamycin. findings for amoxicillin and metronidazole were combined post-hoc to identify peri-implantitis species resistant to both antibiotics. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk diffusion testing. results: one or more cultivable submucosal bacterial pathogens, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens or streptococcus constellatus, were resistant in vitro to clindamycin, amoxicillin, doxycycline, or metronidazole in 46.7%, 39.2%, 25%, and 21.7% of the peri-implantitis subjects, respectively. only 6.7% subjects revealed submucosal test species resistant in vitro to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were either s. constellatus (one subject) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (seven subjects). overall, 71.7% of the 120 peri-implantitis subjects exhibited submucosal bacterial pathogens resistant in vitro to one or more of the tested antibiotics. conclusions: peri-implantitis patients frequently yielded submucosal bacterial pathogens resistant in vitro to individual therapeutic concentrations of clindamycin, amoxicillin, doxycycline, or metronidazole, but only rarely to both amoxicillin and metronidazole. due to the wide variation in observed drug resistance patterns, antibiotic susceptibility testing of cultivable submucosal bacterial pathogens may aid in the selection of antimicrobial therapy for peri-implantitis patients.

TI  == development of an ex vivo coculture system to model pulpal infection by streptococcus anginosus group bacteria.
AB  == introduction: streptococcus anginosus group (sag) bacteria are opportunistic pathogens and a major cause of pulpal infection and subsequent abscess formation. understanding of the processes involved in sag oral infections has been limited by the lack of an appropriate model system. methods: cocultures of sag bacteria and mammalian tooth slices were maintained using a combination of dulbecco modified eagle medium and brain-heart infusion broth at 60 rpm, 37 degrees c, 5%  co(2) for 4, 8, or 24 hours before histologic examination or staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide. tooth slices were also incubated as described with sag bacteria stained with fluorescein diacetate. pulps were extirpated from  infected and sterile cultured tooth slices, messenger rna was extracted and converted to complementary dna, and polymerase chain reaction were performed for  genes encoding tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin-6. results: sag bacteria were able to adhere directly to the central region of the pulpal matrix in small foci that were associated with a localized matrix breakdown. acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining and cell counts indicated a  decrease in mammalian cell viability with increasing incubation times in the presence of sag bacteria. the increased expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1beta was detected in infected tooth slices. conclusions: a novel ex vivo model system has been developed that allows coculture of sag bacteria with a 3-dimensional organotypic tooth slice. the model allows observation of bacterial growth patterns and subsequent responses from host tissues. therefore,  it may be of future use in testing the efficacy of both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory treatments for use in endodontic therapy.

TI  == taxonomy of the anginosus group of the genus streptococcus and description of streptococcus anginosus subsp. whileyi subsp. nov. and streptococcus constellatus subsp. viborgensis subsp. nov.
AB  == the anginosus group of the genus streptococcus has been the subject of much taxonomic confusion, which has hampered the full appreciation of its clinical significance. the purpose of this study was to critically re-examine the taxonomy of the anginosus group, with special attention to beta-haemolytic, lancefield group c strains, using multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) combined with 16s rrna gene sequence and phenotypic analyses. phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of seven housekeeping genes previously used for examination of viridans streptococci distinguished seven distinct and coherent clusters in the anginosus  group. analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences and phenotypic characters supported the mlsa clustering and currently recognized taxa of the anginosus group. single  gene analyses showed considerable allele sharing between species, thereby invalidating identification based on single-locus sequencing. two novel clusters  of beta-haemolytic, lancefield group c strains within the streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus anginosus species and isolated from patients with  sore throat showed sufficient phylogenetic distances from other clusters to warrant status as novel subspecies. the novel cluster within s. anginosus was identified as the previously recognized dna homology cluster, dna group 2. the names s. anginosus subsp. whileyi subsp. nov. (type strain ccug 39159(t) = dsm 25818(t) = sk1267(t)) and s. constellatus subsp. viborgensis subsp. nov. (type strain sk1359(t) = ccug 62387(t) = dsm 25819(t)) are proposed.

TI  == bilateral foveal cysts secondary to streptococcus constellatus endocarditis.
AB  == infective endocarditis can be acute or subacute, depending on the virulence of the causative organism. it can also cause loss of vision by a variety of mechanisms, ranging from embolic retinal artery occlusion to endogenous endophthalmitis. we illustrate the first report of foveal cyst formation secondary to infective endocarditis. a 53-year-old man presented to his general practitioner with a variety of constitutional symptoms, but initial laboratory and imaging investigations revealed only mild normocytic anaemia, and he was discharged from further medical care. four weeks later he developed bilateral visual loss associated with whitish lesions of the superficial retina at both foveae. these later developed into foveal cysts with disruption of the photoreceptor inner segment-outer segment junction and persistent poor visual acuity of 6/60 ou. no retinal haemorrhages or roth spots were noted. only after he presented with visual loss did further investigations reveal the underlying diagnosis of streptococcal endocarditis. ophthalmologists assessing retinal pathology which presents in association with undiagnosed constitutional symptoms  are advised to refer such patients promptly for thorough medical investigation, including blood culture and echocardiography where appropriate.

AB  == history and admission findings: a 38-year-old woman who suffered from migraine was admitted because of severe, worsening headache for 24 hours (dissimilar to the previous migraine attacks), with impaired vision and weakness of the right arm. mild hemiparesis and expressive aphasia indicated an intracranial tumor. investigations: cranial computed tomography revealed a focal lesion with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the left frontoparietal lobe, with signs of intracranial hypertension, indicating cerebral metastasis or an abscess. magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of a brain abscess. treatment and course: an urgent craniotomy was performed and the abscess was evacuated. an empirical antibiotic combination with chloramphenicole and metronidazole (switched to cefotaxime because of thrombocytopenia) was initiated. cultivation of pus revealed streptococcus constellatus, aggregatibacter aphrophilus and fusobacterium spp. within the first two weeks of treatment progession of the abscess was noted, therefore a second craniotomy with debridement was performed.  an elective ct-angio scan revealed several arteriovenous malformations in the caudal segments of both lungs which were embolized without complications. only retrospectively, cutaneous teleangiectasias were recognized. at present, the patient and her direct relatives are submitted to genetical screening for osler's disease. conclusion: in patients with brain abscesses of unknown origin and with  a history of repeated epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, osler's disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) should be considered and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations excluded. physicians should search for cutaneous or mucous teleangiectasias. family screening and long-term follow-up according to international guidelines is recommended.

AB  == members of the streptococcus anginosus group (sags) are significant pathogens. however, their pathogenic mechanisms are incompletely understood. this study investigates the adherence of sags to the matrix proteoglycans decorin and biglycan of soft gingival and alveolar bone. recombinant chondroitin 4-sulphate(c4s)-conjugated decorin and biglycan were synthesised using mammalian  expression systems. c4s-conjugated decorin/biglycan and dermatan sulphate (ds) decorin/biglycan were isolated from ovine alveolar bone and gingival connective tissue, respectively. using surface plasmon resonance, adherence of the sags s. anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius to immobilised proteoglycan was assessed as a function of real-time biofilm formation. all isolates adhered to gingival proteoglycan, 59% percent of isolates adhered to alveolar proteoglycans, 70% to recombinant decorin and 76% to recombinant biglycan. higher adherence was generally noted for s. constellatus and s. intermedius isolates. no differences in adherence were noted between commensal and pathogenic strains to decorin or biglycan. ds demonstrated greater  adherence compared to c4s. removal of the glycosaminoglycan chains with chondroitinase abc resulted in no or minimal adherence for all isolates. these results suggest that sags bind to the extracellular matrix proteoglycans decorin  and biglycan, with interaction mediated by the conjugated glycosaminoglycan chain.

TI  == [problems with identification of beta-hemolytic streptococcus resistant to bacitracin isolated from patients with pharyngitis].
AB  == introduction: the genus streptococcus comprises a number of species characterized by a differential pathogenic potential. these bacteria can be considered as members of microbial physiological flora but they can also cause mild infections  or severe, life threatening conditions. the majority of infections of streptococcal etiology are caused by beta-hemolysing species. the predominant causative agent of bacterial pharyngitis is streptococcus pyogenes. this species  usually doesn't give rise to any identification difficulties due to the introduction the well determined diagnostic schemes. problems concerning laboratory identification can be, however, associated with other species of beta-hemolysing streptococci isolated from patients with pharyngitis. these streptococci can demonstrate features similar to those of s. pyogenes and share the group antygen a, such as some strains of streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the determination of sensitivity to bacitracin, which is a feature typical of s. pyogenes, is the basic test useful for its preliminary identification. nevertheless, the identification of some strains by this test can give rise to incompatibility. the aim of the study  was characterisation of beta-hemolysing streptococci resistant to bacitracin isolated from patients with pharyngitis. the examined bacterial strains caused identification problems by the use of routine diagnostic methods. methods: the material included 14 streptococcal strains resistant to bacitracin which were isolated from adult patients suffering from pharyngitis. the bacteria were cultured on media dedicated for the species. the following routine diagnostic tests were used for the bacterial identification: sensitivity to bacitracin (0.04 u/disc), camp test, determination of the group antigens a, b, c, d, f and g (slidex strepto-kit), and determination of biochemical features by the api 20 strep test (biomerieux). the sensitivity of streptococcal isolates to antibiotics (penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, vancomycin, ofloxacin) and  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, was determined by the disc diffusion method on the mueller-hinton agar with 5% sheep blood (the inoculum-0.5 mcfarland). results: among the 14 isolates resistant to bacitracin, 6 isolates of s. pyogenes, 6 isolates of s. constellatus, and 2 isolates of s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis were identified. all isolates were sensitive to penicillin and vancomycin. one isolate ofs. pyogenes demonstrated constitutive mlsb resistance mechanism. seven  isolates were resistant to tetracycline: s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (3 isolates), s. constellatus (3), and s. pyogenes (1). the number of isolates resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was as follows: s. pyogenes (6) and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (1), whereas four isolates were resistant to ofloxacin. conclusions: the bacitracin test cannot be used as the only test for the laboratory identification of s. pyogenes even if it is combined with the determination of the lancefield group antigen due to the existence of bacitracin  resistant s. pyogenes strains. therefore, it is necessary to perform biochemical  commercial tests in addition to routine phenotypic tests. isolation of beta-hemolysing streptococci other than s. pyogenes from patients with pharyngitis confirms their role in the etiology of this infection. taken into account the significance of determination of sensitivity to bacitracin for the preliminary identification of s. pyogenes, it is necessary to standardize this test, which will make obtaining of the comparability of results possible.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to provide a comprehensive review of the pathogenic role and spectrum of disease of milleri group streptococci, with special attention to bloodstream invasion and to possible differential roles among the three species. all consecutive isolates of milleri group streptococci from any anatomic source, during a 37-month period, in a tertiary care teaching hospital in tel-aviv, israel, were thoroughly investigated. identification to the species level was performed by an automated system.streptococcus anginosus constituted 82% of the 245 patient-unique isolates from hospitalized patients. all nonurinary isolates were involved in pyogenic infections mostly originating from the gastrointestinal tract, with bacteremia in 28 cases. the 71 urinary isolates represented either urinary tract infection or nonsignificant bacteriuria. no specific association could be detected between species and the infection site, except for a higher relative representation of streptococcus constellatus in bacteremia. milleri group streptococci are common in clinical practice and play a different pathogenic role to other viridans streptococci. due to their invariable association with pyogenic processes, their presence in blood  warrants immediate focus identification. in addition, they have a previously unappreciated clinical niche concerning urinary tract infection. the identification of viridans streptococci to the species level is of paramount clinical significance.

AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == [investigation on the identification accuracy for group b streptococcus by automated identification system raisus].
AB  == since we had experienced a case of misidentification for group b streptococcus (gbs) (streptococcus agalactiae) by automated identification system raisus, we have investigated the identification accuracy for gbs by automated identification system raisus system using our stock isolated of gbs. among 31 strains including  standard strain atcc13813 of gbs, 30 strains were identified as gbs, while only 1 strain was misidentified as streptococcus constellatus. we have needed 3 hours to identify 29 true gbs strains, while it has taken 6 hours for misidentified strain as s. constellatus. since we have needed more than 4 hours for our misidentified  strain of gbs, the tendency for identification time to become long has been recognized. longer identification time might be associated with the misidentification. the improvement for galactose and glycerol tests of raisus by  the manufacturer has resulted in better identification. as for the strains to be  identified as s. constellatus by raisus, we might re-check it with other identification kits when there is higher clinical necessity.

TI  == molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the  contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 dna probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cddh) technique. methods: eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. after 30  days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by cddh. data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the kruskal-wallis and dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +treponema socranskii," and the cluster of actinomyces) were assessed. results: most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia, t socranskii, and lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), propionibacterium acnes i and eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and treponema denticola (77.8%). among the cariogenic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than l acidophillus and lactobacillus casei (p <0.001). the periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +t socranskii" (p <0.0001). among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (p <0.0001). the numbers of yellow and green  complex bacteria and the cluster of actinomyces were similar (p >0.05). conclusions: metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.

TI  == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (dnase), the purpose in microbial physiology was  unclear. recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced  virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded dna/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). as nets have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular dnase activity. material and methods: to determine whether dnase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade dna, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. following culture on dna-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and dnase activity related to colony size. results: twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex  members porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum,  parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus and prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular dnase activity. differences in dnase activity were noted, however,  when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. analysis of the activity  of secreted dnase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade nets. conclusion: the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that dnase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial dnase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

AB  == this report describes a case of chronic and deep pyodermitis in a 4-year-old male dog with a 3-month skin problems history that had been treated unsuccessfully with fluoroquinolone therapy, prescribed by a private medical veterinary practice, without an early diagnosis. microbiological examination and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed in our laboratory (faculty of veterinary medicine) and a diagnosis of streptococcus constellatus-associated pyoderma in the dog was made. a new antimicrobial treatment, with tetracyclines,  was designed after the definitive diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed by the kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. the dog remained free of clinical illness at completion of therapy. to our knowledge, this is the first case of a canine pyoderma caused by s. constellatus, a commensal organism which may also cause pyogenic infections. furthermore, this study confirms that a fluoroquinolone represents a poor empirical choice for initial therapy of canine  pyoderma.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == development of real-time pcr assays for detection of the streptococcus milleri group from cystic fibrosis clinical specimens by targeting the cpn60 and 16s rrna genes.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) is a multiorgan disease, with the majority of mortalities resulting from pulmonary failure due to repeated pulmonary exacerbations. recently, members of the streptococcus anginosus group (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. intermedius), herein referred to as the "streptococcus milleri group" (smg) have been implicated as important etiological pathogens contributing to pulmonary exacerbations in cf patients. this is partly due to better microbiological detection of the smg species through the development of a  novel specific medium termed "mckay agar." mckay agar demonstrated that smg has been an underreported respiratory pathogen contributing to lung exacerbations. our aim was to develop a real-time pcr assay to expedite the detection of smg within diagnostic samples. the cpn60 gene was chosen as a target, with all three  members amplified using a single hybridization probe set. smg strain analysis showed that speciation based on melting curve analysis allowed for the majority of the s. constellatus (96%), s. intermedius (94%), and s. anginosus (60%) strains to be correctly identified. to increase specificity for s. anginosus, two 16s rrna real-time pcr assays were developed targeting the 16s rrna gene. the 16s_sa assay is specific for s. anginosus (100%), while the 16s_sci assay is specific for s. constellatus and s. intermedius (100%). these assays can detect <10 genome equivalents in pure culture and >10(4) genome equivalents in sputum samples, making this a great tool for assessment of the presence of smg in complex polymicrobial samples. novel molecular methods were developed providing detection ability for smg, an emerging opportunistic pathogen.

TI  == mckay agar enables routine quantification of the 'streptococcus milleri' group in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == the 'streptococcus milleri' group (smg) has recently been recognized as a contributor to bronchopulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis (cf). routine detection and quantification is limited by current cf microbiology protocols. mckay agar was developed previously for the semi-selective isolation of this group. here, mckay agar was validated against a panel of clinical smg isolates, which revealed improved smg recovery compared with columbia blood agar. the effectiveness of this medium was evaluated by appending it to the standard cf sputum microbiology protocols in a clinical laboratory for a 6-month period. all  unique colony types were isolated and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. whilst a wide variety of organisms were isolated, members of the smg were the most prevalent bacteria cultured, and mckay agar allowed routine quantification of the smg from 10(3) to >10(8) c.f.u. ml(-1) directly from sputum. all members of the smg were detected [streptococcus anginosus (40.7 %), streptococcus intermedius (34.3 %) and streptococcus constellatus (25 %)] with an overall prevalence rate of 40.6 % in our adult cf population. without exception, samples  where smg isolates were cultured at 10(7) c.f.u. ml(-1) or greater were associated with pulmonary exacerbations. this study demonstrates that mckay agar  can be used routinely to quantify the smg from complex clinical samples.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus milleri group isolates from expectorated sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == with the recent insights into the streptococcus milleri group (smg) as pulmonary  pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), we sought to characterize 128 isolates from the sputum of adults with cf, along with 45 isolates from patients  with invasive diseases for comparison. the tests performed included lancefield grouping; tests for hemolysis; tests for the production of hyaluronidase, chondroitin sulfatase, dnase, proteases, and hydrogen peroxide; and pcr for the detection of the intermedilysin gene (ily). we also generated biochemical profiles with the rapid id strep 32 api system and tested cell-free supernatants  for the presence of the signal molecule autoinducer-2 (ai-2) using a vibrio harveyi bioassay with a subset of cf strains. the s. intermedius isolates from both strain collections were similar, while the s. constellatus and s. anginosus  isolates yielded several biotypes that differed in prevalence between the two strain collections. beta-hemolytic, lancefield group c s. constellatus comprised  74.4% of the s. constellatus isolates from patients with cf but only 13.3% of the corresponding isolates from patients with invasive infections. this was the only  s. constellatus biotype associated with pulmonary exacerbations. hyaluronidase-positive s. anginosus was detected only among the isolates from patients with cf. strain-to-strain variability in ai-2 expression was evident, with the mean values being the highest for s. anginosus, followed by s. constellatus and then s. intermedius. cluster analysis and 16s rrna sequencing revealed that the species of smg could be accurately determined with a minimum of three phenotypic tests: tests for the lancefield group, hyaluronidase production, and chondroitin sulfatase production. furthermore, isolates from patients with invasive infections clustered with isolates from the sputum of patients with cf,  suggesting that the respiratory tract isolates were equally pathogenic.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2007 to march 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated.  among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, b. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by b. fragilis, bacteroides caccae and b. wadsworthia in this order. in  this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. there were nine strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci which show higher mic against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/ml, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

AB  == there are few studies reporting pyogenic liver abscess (pla) caused by streptococcus constellatus in the medical literature. s. constellatus is a comensal microorganism that belongs to the streptococcus milleri's bacteria group and is not considered to be pathogenic for humans. we report the case of a 23-year-old man with a 15-days history of abdominal pain in the right flank followed by daily fever, chills, nausea, vomits, sialism and jaundice. physical examination revealed moderate jaundice (2+/4+), abdominal distention, generalized pain and tender over the right flank with positive blumberg's sign. additionally, the liver was palpable 5 cm below the costal margin in the right midclavicular line. abdominal computerized tomography showed multiple hypodense hepatic images  suggestive of liver abscesses. the patient underwent surgical exploration of the  abdomen through a sub-costal incision and, during operation ruptured abscess localized on the hepatic segment iii was drained. culture of the purulent material obtained at surgery yielded streptococcus constellatus as the causative  agent. liver abscess is a potential life-threatening disease that must be treated as soon as possible with invasive approaches, if necessary, and bacteriological studies performed when possible, allowing isolation of causative agents and specific antibiotic therapy.

TI  == evaluation of genotypic and phenotypic methods for differentiation of the members of the anginosus group streptococci.
AB  == the terminology and classification of the anginosus group streptococci has been inconsistent. we tested the utility of 16s rrna gene and tuf gene sequencing and  conventional biochemical tests for the reliable differentiation of the anginosus  group streptococci. biochemical testing included rapid id 32 strep, api strep, fluo-card milleri, wee-tabs, and lancefield antigen typing. altogether, 61 anginosus group isolates from skin and soft tissue infections and four reference  strains were included. our results showed a good agreement between 16s rrna gene  and tuf gene sequencing. using the full sequence was less discriminatory than using the first part of the 16s rrna gene. the three species could not be separated with the api 20 strep test. streptococcus intermedius could be differentiated from the other two species by beta-galactosidase (onpg) and beta-n-acetyl-glucosaminidase reactions. rapid id 32 strep beta-glucosidase reaction was useful in separating s. anginosus strains from s. constellatus. in conclusion, both 16s rrna gene and tuf gene sequencing can be used for the reliable identification of the anginosus group streptococci. s. intermedius can be readily differentiated from the other two species by phenotypic tests; however, 16s rrna gene or tuf gene sequencing may be needed for separating some strains of s. constellatus from s. anginosus.

TI  == identification and molecular analysis of betac-s lyase producing hydrogen sulfide in streptococcus intermedius.
AB  == hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) is a toxic gas that induces the modification and release of haemoglobin in erythrocytes; however, it also functions in methionine biosynthesis in bacteria. betac-s lyase, encoded by the lcd gene, is responsible  for bacterial h(2)s production through the cleavage of l-cysteine. in this study, 26 of 29 crude extracts from reference and clinical strains of streptococcus intermedius produced h(2)s from l-cysteine. the capacities in those strains were  not higher than those in strains of the other anginosus group of streptococci, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus constellatus, but were much greater than those in strains of streptococcus gordonii, which is known to have an extremely low capacity for h(2)s production. incubation of the remaining three extracts with l-cysteine did not result in h(2)s production. sequence analysis revealed that the lcd genes from these three strains (s. intermedius strains atcc 27335, imu151 and imu202) contained mutations or small deletions. h(2)s production in crude extracts prepared from s. intermedius atcc 27335 was restored by repairing the lcd gene sequence in genomic dna. the kinetic properties of the  purified recombinant protein encoded by the repaired lcd gene were comparable to  those of native proteins produced by h(2)s-producing strains, whereas the truncated protein produced by s. intermedius atcc 27335 had no enzymic activity with l-cysteine or l-cystathionine. however, real-time pcr analysis indicated that the lcd gene in strains atcc 27335, imu151 and imu202 is transcribed and regulated in a manner similar to that in the h(2)s-producing strain.

TI  == a polymicrobial perspective of pulmonary infections exposes an enigmatic pathogen in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == lung disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (cf) patients. a modest number of bacterial pathogens have been correlated with pulmonary function decline; however, microbiological and molecular evidence suggests that cf airway infection is polymicrobial. to obtain a more complete assessment of the microbial community composition and dynamics, we undertook a longitudinal study by using culture-independent and microbiological approaches. in the process, we demonstrated that within complex and dynamic communities, the  streptococcus milleri group (smg) can establish chronic pulmonary infections and  at the onset of 39% of acute pulmonary exacerbations, smg is the numerically dominant pathogen. we report the comprehensive polymicrobial community dynamics of a cf lung infection in a clinically relevant context. if a given organism, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, becomes resistant to antibiotic therapy, an alternative treatment avenue may mediate the desired clinical response by effectively managing the composition of the microbial community.

TI  == molecular and enzymatic characterization of betac-s lyase in streptococcus constellatus.
AB  == background/aims: streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus constellatus are frequently isolated from dental abscesses and other suppurative lesions. we previously reported that betac-s lyase from a strain of s. anginosus produced significantly more hydrogen sulfide than betac-s lyases from other streptococci.  the purpose of this study was to establish the molecular and enzymatic features of the betac-s lyase in s. constellatus and to elucidate whether this unique capacity is common to many strains of s. constellatus and s. anginosus. methods:  the capacity of crude extract to produce hydrogen sulfide was evaluated among 16  strains of s. constellatus, s. anginosus, and streptococcus gordonii. the lcd gene encoding betac-s lyase was cloned from the genomic dna of each strain to compare the deduced amino acid sequences. the recombinant betac-s lyases of three representative strains were purified and characterized. results: incubation of crude extracts from all strains of s. constellatus and s. anginosus with l-cysteine resulted in the production of a large amount of hydrogen sulfide. the  primary sequence of betac-s lyase was very similar among strains of s. constellatus and s. anginosus. the kinetic properties of the betac-s lyases purified from s. constellatus resembled those for betac-s lyases purified from s. anginosus. in contrast, the betac-s lyases of s. constellatus and s. gordonii differed in terms of their hydrogen sulfide production, with the former producing much more. conclusion: a high level of hydrogen sulfide production, which appears to be a common feature in both s. constellatus and s. anginosus, may be associated with their abscess formation.

AB  == group milleri streptococci (gms) comprise a heterogeneous group of streptococci including the species intermedius, constellatus and anginosus. they may cause chronic intra-abdominal and intrathoracic abscesses, which are difficult to treat. this is a retrospective analysis including 45 transplant recipients in whom gms were isolated. the epidemiology, clinical significance and the impact on the outcome in all transplant patients with infections caused by gms during a 4-year period (2001-2004) was evaluated. the 45 solid organ recipients (88 isolates) included 34 liver-, four kidney/pancreas-, one kidney-, two small bowel-, three combined liver/kidney- and one combined kidney/small bowel transplant recipient. in 42 cases gms caused intra-abdominal infection, in two cases pleural empyema and in one case soft tissue infection. only a single isolate of gms was cultured from blood. in 54 of the 88 specimens (61%), which grew gms, other pathogens were also isolated. gms frequently caused recurrent cholangitis (n = 17) associated with anastomotic and nonanastomotic biliary strictures. these cases were managed by repeated stenting or surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy. no patient died directly related to gms infection and all except one case responded to combined surgical/antibiotic treatment. one pancreas graft was lost because of erosion haemorrhage associated with an abscess. gms were susceptible to penicillin g, carbapenems and clindamycin, whereas cephalosporins and quinolones showed intermediate activity or resistance in some cases, and gms in general were found  resistant to aminoglycosides. gms may cause serious infections in transplant recipients which are difficult to treat. their prevalence in transplant surgical  site infections thus far may have been underestimated.

TI  == surgical site infections in day surgery settings.
AB  == background: because major complications are rare in day surgery, minor morbidities such as surgical site infections, which become evident only after patient discharge, have a major impact on the perceived quality of care. we performed an audit of such infections over a oneyear period. methods: all procedures were performed in a multidisciplinary day surgery setting. there were  155 inguinal hernia repairs, 44 excisions of lipomas, and 27 excisions of pilonidal cysts. all patients received antibiotic prophylaxis according to a rotation protocol. results: one patient (0.65%) operated on for inguinal hernia developed a deep incisional infection caused by staphylococcus schleiferi. the patient was treated using selective antibiotics, and complete recovery ensued. one patient (2.27%) who underwent excision of a lipoma revealed developed a deep  incisional infection associated with fever (39 degrees c) caused by staphylococcus aureus. he was treated by daily antibiotics and application of dressings for two weeks and recovered. one patient (3.7%) treated for pilonidal cyst developed a deep incisional surgical site infection. a group a streptococcus was isolated, and he received an intravenous antibiotic for ten days. in the seven patients treated for pilonidal cyst with the wound left open, swab specimens were taken because of persisting local pain, and the following bacteria were found: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus constellatus. no antibiotic therapy was given, and local wound care led to complete recovery. conclusion: in our day surgery unit, the rates of surgical site infection are similar to those described in the literature. continuing audit is essential to maintain and improve the quality and standard of the surgery provided. prevention of surgical site infection is very much the responsibility of the persons working in the operating theater. therefore, it is vital not only to apply strict regulations concerning everyday management but also to maintain a high degree of motivation among the personnel.

TI  == hypertrophic osteoarthropathy secondary to vascular prosthesis infection: report  of 3 cases and review of the literature.
AB  == an infected vascular graft is an uncommon association in hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (hoa) but is important because of potential catastrophic complications. here we describe 3 new patients with hoa secondary to vascular prosthesis infection and review the other 23 patients described in the english literature with this clinical syndrome. the finding of symptoms and signs of localized hoa in patients with arterial prosthesis may be the presenting manifestation of graft sepsis. in most patients the graft is located at the aorta or aortic bifurcation. the initial symptoms are fever, joint pain mainly involving the knees and ankles, clubbing, and in some cases intestinal bleeding.  recurrent abscesses and bacteremia arising in spite of appropriate antimicrobial  therapy are prominent infectious signs. another characteristic feature is the wide variety of bacteria isolated from a single patient. when a polymicrobial enteric flora is isolated from the blood or other tissue, an intestinal origin of infection can be readily suspected. gallium or leukocyte scans are useful for detecting an abscess around the vascular prosthesis. in some cases, the detection of gas around the graft demonstrated by computed tomography is highly suggestive  of prosthesis infection. mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hoa associated with aortic graft infection are unknown. treatment consists of intravenous antibiotics and surgical replacement of the infected graft. the prognosis of arterial prosthesis infection depends greatly on early diagnosis and treatment before the onset of life-threatening complications. knowledge of this rare association may lead to an early diagnosis and appropriate management of this serious and often fatal complication.

TI  == acute glomerulonephritis associated with streptococcus pyogenes with concomitant  spread of streptococcus constellatus in four rural families.
AB  == we studied history, renal histopathology and microbiology of an epidemic of acute glomerulonephritis associated with throat infections and uncommon culture results in four neighbour families. a 40-year-old man (index patient) was referred to a university hospital for dialysis and kidney biopsy due to a suspected acute glomerulonephritis. an acute tonsillitis had preceded the condition. penicillin treatment had been started four days before the discovery of renal failure. throat swabs were positive for beta-hemolytic streptococci, group c (gcs). gcs were also found in throat cultures from his wife and two of their children. the bacteria were typed as streptococcus constellatus. a third child had s. constellatus expressing lancefield antigen group g. a neighbour and two of his children fell ill the following week with renal involvement. throat swabs from both these children were positive for s. constellatus. his third child had erythema multiforme and s. constellatus in the throat while a fourth child had beta-hemolytic streptococci group a; streptococcus pyogenes. kidney biopsies on the index patient and his neighbour showed an acute diffuse prolipherative glomerulonephritis compatible with acute post-streptococcal nephritis and microbiological analysis of renal tissue revealed in both cases s. pyogenes and s. constellatus. the families had had much contact and had consumed unpasteurized milk from our index patient's farm. in four of seven persons in two additional neighbouring families s. constellatus was found in throat swabs during the same month while two persons carried streptococcus anginosus expressing the lancefield c antigen. in conclusion spread of s. constellatus coincided with the occurrence  of four cases of acute glomerulonephritis. the two biopsied patients had both s.  pyogenes and s. constellatus present in renal tissue. the epidemic either suggested that the outbreak of glomerulonephritis was due to s. pyogenes but coincided with the transmission and colonization of s. constellatus or that the s. constellatus strains were highly pathogenic or nephritogenic and that this organism can be transmitted in such cases.

AB  == the in vitro activities of sitafloxacin and seven other fluoroquinolones a (ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, t-3811me, moxifloxacin  and trovafloxacin) were examined by the microdilution method against 79 clinically isolated 'streptococcus milleri' group (smg) microorganisms. no statistically significant differences were found between the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic(50) and mic(90)) against streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus constellatus. sitafloxacin was the most active agent of the eight fluoroquinolones tested against smg, with a mic(90) of 0.06 microg/ml, which was  8 times more active than ciprofloxacin and 16 times more active than levofloxacin. although none of the smg strains showed high resistance to any of the fluoroquinolones tested, three agents (trovafloxacin, sitafloxacin and t-3811me) had low mics against 23 smg strains against which levofloxacin had a mic> 1 microg/ml. in conclusion, several fluoroquinolones have low mics against smg, but sitafloxacin has the lowest.

TI  == identification of 43 streptococcus species by pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpb gene.
AB  == pyrosequencing technology was evaluated for identification of species within the  streptococcus genus. two variable regions in the rnpb gene, which encodes the rna subunit of endonuclease p, were sequenced in two reactions. of 43 species, all could be identified to the species level except strains of the species pairs streptococcus anginosus/s. constellatus and s. infantis/s. peroris. a total of 113 blood culture isolates were identified by pyrosequencing analysis of partial  rnpb sequences. all but eight isolates could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species when the first 30 nucleotides of the two regions were compared to an rnpb database comprising 107 streptococcal strains. principal coordinate analysis of sequence variation of strains from viridans group streptococci resulted in species-specific clusters for the mitis and the salivarius groups but not for the anginosus group. the identification capacity of pyrosequencing was compared to the biochemical test systems vitek 2 and rapid id 32 strep. the concordance between pyrosequencing and vitek 2 was 75%, and for rapid id 32 strep the corresponding figure was 77%. isolates with discrepant identifications in the three methods were subjected to entire rnpb dna sequence analysis that confirmed  the identifications by pyrosequencing. in conclusion, pyrosequencing analysis of  the rnpb gene can reliably identify streptococcus species with high resolution.

TI  == epidural abscess caused by streptococcus milleri in a pregnant woman.
AB  == background: bacteria in the streptococcus milleri group (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. intermedius) are associated with bacteremia and abscess formation. while most reports of streptococcus milleri group (smg) infection occur in patients with underlying medical conditions, smg infections during pregnancy have been documented. however, smg infections in pregnant women are associated with either neonatal or maternal puerperal sepsis. albeit rare, s. milleri spinal-epidural abscess in pregnancy has been reported, always as a complication of spinal-epidural anesthesia. we report a case of spinal-epidural abscess caused by smg in a young, pregnant woman without an antecedent history of spinal epidural anesthesia and without any underlying risk factors for invasive streptococcal disease. case presentation: a 25 year old pregnant woman developed  neurological symptoms consistent with spinal cord compression at 20 weeks gestation. she underwent emergency laminectomy for decompression and was treated  with ceftriaxone 2 gm iv daily for 28 days. she was ambulatory at the time of discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation unit with residual lower extremity weakness. conclusion: to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a streptococcus milleri epidural abscess in a healthy, pregnant woman with no history of epidural anesthesia or invasive procedures. this report adds to the body of literature on smg invasive infections. treatment of smg spinal-epidural abscess with neurologic manifestations should include prompt and aggressive surgical decompression coupled with targeted anti-infective therapy.

TI  == experimental abscess formation caused by human dental plaque.
AB  == human dental plaque consists of a wide variety of microorganisms, some of which are believed to cause systemic infections, including abscesses, at various sites  in the body. to confirm this hypothesis experimentally, we examined the abscess-forming ability of native dental plaque in mice, the microbial features of the infectious locus produced by the plaque, and the anti-phagocytic property  of microbial isolates. aliquots of a suspension of supragingival dental plaque containing 6 x 10(6) colony-forming unit of bacteria were injected subcutaneously into the dorsa of mice. abscess formation was induced in 76 of 85 mice using ten  different plaque samples. thirteen microorganisms were isolated from pus samples  aspirated from abscess lesions. the microbial composition of pus, examined in 17  of 76 abscesses, was very simple compared to that of the plaque sample that had induced the abscess. the majority of the isolates belonged to the streptococcus anginosus group, normally a minor component of plaque samples. s. anginosus was the most frequently detected organism and the most prevalent in seven abscesses,  and streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in  one and three abscess samples, respectively. each isolate of s. anginosus group produced abscesses in mice, and heat-treated supragingival dental plaque influenced the abscess-forming ability of s. anginosus isolate. these isolates possessed a high antiphagocytic capacity against human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. our results suggest that human supragingival dental plaque itself is  a source of the infectious pathogens that cause abscess formation.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == phototargeting oral black-pigmented bacteria.
AB  == we have found that broadband light (380 to 520 nm) rapidly and selectively kills  oral black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) in pure cultures and in dental plaque samples obtained from human subjects with chronic periodontitis. we hypothesize that this killing effect is a result of light excitation of their endogenous porphyrins. cultures of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens were killed by 4.2 j/cm2, whereas p. melaninogenica required 21 j/cm2. exposure to light with a fluence of  42 j/cm2 produced 99% killing of p. gingivalis. high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of various amounts of different porphyrin molecules in bpb. the amounts of endogenous porphyrin in bpb were 267 (p. intermedia), 47 (p. nigrescens), 41 (p. melaninogenica), and 2.2 (p. gingivalis) ng/mg. analysis of bacteria in dental plaque samples by dna-dna hybridization for 40 taxa before and after phototherapy showed that the growth of the four bpb was decreased by 2 and 3 times after irradiation at energy fluences  of 4.2 and 21 j/cm2, respectively, whereas the growth of the remaining 36 microorganisms was decreased by 1.5 times at both energy fluences. the present study suggests that intraoral light exposure may be used to control bpb growth and possibly benefit patients with periodontal disease.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus constellatus strains recovered from a brain abscess and periodontal pockets in an immunocompromised patient.
AB  == background: there have been a number of reports of brain abscesses suggesting an  odontogenic etiology. however, no efforts have been made to compare brain abscess isolates with isolates from the oral cavity using highly discriminative methods.  we report a brain abscess caused by streptococcus constellatus in an immunocompromised patient where oral infection (periodontitis) was suspected to be implicated. methods: the brain abscess and oral isolates were compared by means of one phenotypic and three genetic (restriction fragment length polymorphism [rflp], ribotyping, and random amplified polymorphic dna [rapd]) fingerprinting techniques. results: the phenotypic method and rflp showed identical profiles between brain and periodontal isolates, while ribotyping and rapd showed very close similarity, with only one band difference in one of the three ribotypes and in one of the three polymorphic rapd. conclusions: gene transfer by genetic recombinational events in the periodontal pocket might have been responsible for the emergence of a strain variant of s. constellatus that had the potential to cause an abscess at a distant site (brain). the importance of odontogenic sources as potential foci of infection for brain abscesses is discussed.

TI  == efficacy of antibiotics against periodontopathogenic bacteria within epithelial cells: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: periodontopathogenic bacteria can invade and survive within epithelial cells, but susceptibility of intracellular infection to antibiotics used in periodontitis treatment has not been studied to date. methods: kb cells were infected by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, strain nctc 9710; porphyromonas gingivalis, strains atcc 33277 and jh16-1; or streptococcus constellatus, strain j012b. after 2, 4, and 12 hours the bactericidal effect of antibiotics (clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin) on intracellular microorganisms was tested at a concentration up to the 100-fold minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined separately on planktonic bacteria. results: the p. gingivalis strains differed in their invasiveness and atcc 33277 was 100-fold more invasive than jh16-1. doxycycline and clindamycin at a concentration 10-fold mic had no effect, but p. gingivalis intercellular infection was significantly reduced by metronidazole at 10-fold mic after 2 and 4 hours. moxifloxacin was effective, but a 100-fold mic concentration was necessary to reduce p. gingivalis strains intracellular growth to 7% of the control. other  bacterial species grown inside the kb cells were more susceptible to antibiotics. clindamycin at 10-fold mic reduced the number of intracellular s. constellatus after 4 and 12 hours. this bacterium was eliminated by moxifloxacin at 50-fold mic. intracellular a. actinomycetemcomitans was killed by 10-fold mic of doxycycline and moxifloxacin after 4 hours incubation. conclusions: moxifloxacin  was the most efficient antibiotic to treat intracellular infection. however, taking into account the mic values and the levels of antibiotics in gingival fluid, elimination of intracellular bacteria by antibiotics alone seems to be questionable.

TI  == surface free energy and bacterial retention to saliva-coated dental implant materials--an in vitro study.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to compare the in vitro bacterial retention on saliva-coated implant materials (pure titanium grade 2 (cp-ti) and a titanium alloy (ti-6al-4v) surfaces), presenting similar surface roughness, and to assess the influence of physico-chemical surface properties of bacterial strain and implant materials on in vitro bacterial adherence. two bacterial strains (one hydrophilic strain and one hydrophobic strain) were used and the following were evaluated: bacterial cell adherence, sfe values as well as the lifshitz-van-der waals, the lewis acid base components of sfe, the interfacial free energy and the non-dispersive interactions according to two complementary contact angle measurement methods: the sessile drop method and the captive bubble method. our results showed similar patterns of adherent bacterial cells on saliva-coated cp-ti and saliva-coated ti-6al-4v. these findings could suggest that bacterial colonization (i.e. plaque formation) is similar on saliva-coated cp-ti and ti-6al-4v surfaces and indicate that both materials could be suitable for use as transgingival abutment or healing implant components. the same physico-chemical properties exhibited by saliva-coated cp-ti and ta6v, as shown by the sessile drop method and the captive bubble method, could explain this similar bacterial colonisation. therefore, higher values of total surface free energy of saliva-coated cp-ti and saliva-coated ta6v samples (gamma(sv) approximately 65mj/m(2)) were reported using the captive bubble method indicating a less hydrophobic character of these surfaces than with the sessile drop method  (gamma(s) approximately 44.50mj/m(2)) and consequently possible differences in oral bacterial retention according the theory described by absolom et al. the number of adherent hydrophobic s. sanguinis cells was two-fold higher than that of hydrophilic s. constellatus cells. our results confirm that physico-chemical surface properties of oral bacterial strains play a role in bacterial retention to implant materials in the presence of adsorbed salivary proteins.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  == background: the present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. method: fourteen subjects were  identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (srp), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. after baseline monitoring, subjects received srp, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically  administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. significance of changes in clinical and  microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the friedman or wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: on average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. mean (+/-sem) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. reductions occurred for three actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including campylobacter showae, eubacterium nodatum, three fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia as well as the "streptococcus milleri" group, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedus. subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. conclusions: the combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.

AB  == background & objectives: though carriage and local infection with organisms of the streptococcus milleri group (smg) are regular in clinical practice, bacteraemia is infrequent in man. the objective of the present study was to give  an account of our experience with the smg bacteraemia over a period of 12 yr in north yorkshire. methods: the laboratory and clinical records of all clinically significant cases of smg bacteraemia in our district general hospital catchment (combined population 260,000) were reviewed for the 12 yr period from 1989 to 2000. viable isolates were recovered, species identified, and minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic) determined. results: twenty nine episodes of infection gave an annual incidence of 0.93 cases per 100,000 population. infections included abscess, pneumonia, septic arthritis, genital and urinary tract infections, endocarditis and diffuse septicaemia. patient ages ranged from 18 to 90 yr but most patients were elderly, 82 per cent had evident predisposing conditions and mortality rate was 10 per cent. species determination of the 22 isolates showed s. anginosus (64%), s. constellatus (27%) and s. intermedius (9%). nearly all isolates were non-haemolytic and lancefield grouping showed carriage of the f antigen (in 41%), c (14%) and no detected group (45%). most of the isolates were  susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. interpretation & conclusion: bacteraemia with smg organisms was infrequent, often opportunistic and featured a low overall mortality rate. intra-abdominal sepsis was the local feature in 16 (55%) of the patients and 9 (31%) of the total patient group showed abscess or empyema. there was a low rate of antibiotic resistance in these organisms from bloodstream infection.

TI  == effect of saliva on an antimicrobial tissue conditioner containing silver-zeolite.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of human saliva on the antimicrobial effect of a tissue conditioner containing an antibiotic agent, silver-zeolite. samples of each tissue conditioner with or without silver-zeolite were prepared and a plastic disk was used as a control. candida albicans and nosocomial respiratory infection-causing bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa and the streptococcus milleri group (s. constellatus and s. intermedius), were selected as test microorganisms. antimicrobial effects of samples after water or saliva immersion for 28 days were evaluated by counting the number of viable cells [colony forming unit (cfu)] in each microbial suspension (100 microl). all data were statistically analysed by one-way anova and bonferroni's test (p < 0.05). the antimicrobial effects of samples with silver-zeolite immersed in saliva against c. albicans, s. aureus and mrsa were observed while cfu of p. aeruginosa  indicated no significant difference from that of the control. as for the s. milleri group, its cfu after saliva immersion showed the significantly smaller value than that of the control. it is concluded that the antimicrobial effects of samples containing silver-zeolite against all tested microbes except for p. aeruginosa and the s. milleri group are not influenced by saliva immersion for 28 days.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci by sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna spacer region.
AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

TI  == the role of the capsule of the streptococcus milleri group in its pathogenicity.
AB  == study of the pathogenicity of encapsulated strains of the streptococcus milleri group (smg) was performed by examination of the ability to cause subcutaneous abscesses in mice and by phagocytosis and phagocytic killing of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) against the organisms. all 3 encapsulated isolates from patients with pneumonia or lung abscess induced abscesses in the mice; however, only 2 of 20 unencapsulated isolates from patients with lung abscess or thoracic empyema did so. the 3 encapsulated strains inhibited more phagocytosis and phagocytic killing of pmns than the unencapsulated strains. in addition, encapsular material separated from streptococcus constellatus rzyk001 also inhibited phagocytosis and phagocytic killing in proportion to increasing concentrations of the capsular material. these results suggest that capsular material produced by smg might be a pathogenic factor.

TI  == efficacy of antibiotics to strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria within a single species biofilm - an in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: this study examined differences in the efficacy of antibiotics against a single strain of three periodontal pathogens grown in an artificial biofilm. methods: single species biofilms were established with artificial saliva and one of the following bacterial strains: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  y4, streptococcus constellatus 384b (a clinical isolate) and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277. the efficacy of the antibiotics clindamycin, doxycycline,  metronidazole, and moxifloxacin to these bacteria was determined using concentrations up to 100-fold minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to planctonic bacteria over 48 h. results: the ability of the bacteria to form a biofilm varied. the biofilms of s. constellatus 384b and a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 contained more viable bacteria and showed a larger thickness in sem photographs than those of p. gingivalis atcc 33277. the antibiotics tested showed different efficacy for the different strains. moxifloxacin was the most efficient antibiotic: onefold mic was sufficient to eliminate a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and p. gingivalis atcc 33277 after 48 h. however, only the 50-fold mic completely eradicated s. constellatus 384b. sem photographs underlined the damaging effect of moxifloxacin on the biofilm structure. conclusion: the complete removal of bacteria by the use of antibiotics alone seems to be impossible when taking into  account mic values and the level of antibiotics in gingival fluid.

TI  == streptococcus constellatus causing myocardial abscess complicated by cerebritis.
AB  == streptococcus constellatus infection is a rare cause of myocardial abscess. the complication of cerebritis is also rare. we report a case of s. constellatus bacteremia in a 21-year-old woman who developed fever and watery diarrhea 7 days  prior to admission. computed tomography of the brain showed severe effacement of  the cerebral sulci, narrowing of the ventricular system, and severe brain swelling. echocardiography showed a cystic lesion of about 2 cm(2) over the left  atrium. mannitol and dexamethasone were administered. hyperventilation was performed. intravenous penicillin g and ceftazidime were administered but without response. the increased intracranial pressure persisted despite medical treatment. she died 3 days after admission. culture of cerebrospinal fluid grew s. constellatus and 3 sets of blood cultures grew s. constellatus. this case emphasizes the potential pathogenic role of s. constellatus in myocardial abscess.

TI  == identification of the anginosus group within the genus streptococcus using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the aim of this study was to establish an identification method for the anginosus group within the genus streptococcus by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). using a  primer pair based on the group-specific sequences of penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) gene, a 275-bp fragment was amplified from each species in the group but no size-matched products were obtained in other streptococci. further identification in the species or subspecies level was possible by a multiplex pcr with primers for the 16s ribosomal rna gene of streptococcus anginosus, the hyaluronate lyase genes both of streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus, and the intermedilysin (ily) gene of s. intermedius. in the case ofstreptococcus constellatus subsp. pharyngis, the amplified fragment from the s. intermedius-type hyaluronate lyase gene was obtained, while that from the ily gene was not. these results also indicate that  two different hyaluronate lyase genes are distributed among the anginosus group.

TI  == [clinical efficacy of oral clarithromycin monotherapy in patients with mild or moderate community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  == clarithromycin (cam) is a new macrolide antibiotic which is active against a wide range of organisms responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and has superior pharmacokinetics and tolerance compared to erythromycin. in this study,  we evaluated the clinical efficacy and antimicrobial activity of cam in the empirical treatment of patients with cap. cam (200 mg given twice daily for 2 weeks) was orally administered to 26 patients with mild or moderate suspected atypical pneumonia, including 15 patients in whom treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics was largely ineffective. causative pathogens were identified on the basis of quantitative sputum cultures, blood cultures, and routine serological testings; m. pneumoniae was most commonly observed in patients with cap (38.5%; 10/26), followed by h. influenzae (11.5%; 3/26), c. pneumoniae (3.8%; 1/26), and  s. constellatus (3.8%; 1/26). penicillin-resistant, or penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from 1 patient (3.8%) and 2 patients (7.7%), respectively out of 26 patients with cap. there were no detectable pathogens in 8 of 26 patients. the treatment of cam resulted in complete resolution of all signs and symptoms of pneumonia in all the patients and was not accompanied with any adverse events. the overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was not detectable in the patients evaluated. although it is important to make differential diagnosis of atypical from bacterial pneumonia in  designing therapeutic strategy, it is often difficult to make an appropriate diagnosis in patients with cap. because of diagnostic difficulties, cam with a broad antimicrobial spectrum is recommended as the first-line drug for the treatment of lower respiratory infections, particularly in patients with suspected atypical pneumonia.

TI  == "streptococcus milleri" endocarditis caused by streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == unlike other viridans streptococci, members of the "streptococcus milleri group"  are often associated with abscess formation, but are only rare causes of infective endocarditis. although it has been shown that almost all s. intermedius isolates and most s. constellatus isolates, but only 19% of s. anginosus isolates, were associated with abscess formation, no report has addressed the relative importance of the 3 species of the "s. milleri group" in infective endocarditis. during a 5-year period (april 1997 through march 2002), 6 cases of  "s. milleri" endocarditis (out of 377 cases of infective endocarditis), that fulfil the duke's criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, were encountered. all 6 "s. milleri" isolates were identified as s. anginosus by 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing. three patients had underlying chronic rheumatic heart disease and 1 was an iv drug abuser. five had monomicrobial bacteremia, and 1 had polymicrobial (s. anginosus, s. mitis, granulicatella adiacens, and slackia exigua) bacteremia. two patients died. none of the 6 isolates were identified by the vitek system (gpi) or the api system (20 strep) at >95% confidence. all 6 isolates were sensitive to penicillin g (mic 0.008-0.064 microg/ml), cefalothin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. accurate identification to the species level, by 16s rrna gene sequencing, in cases of bacteremia caused by members of the "s. milleri group", would have direct implication on the underlying disease process, hence guiding diagnosis and treatment. infective endocarditis should be actively looked for in cases of monomicrobial s. anginosus bacteremia, especially if the organism is recovered in multiple blood cultures.

TI  == platelet responses and anaphylaxis-like shock induced in mice by intravenous injection of whole cells of oral streptococci.
AB  == intravenous injection of lyophilized whole cells of various oral streptococcal strains into muramyldipeptide (mdp)-primed c3h/hen mice induces rapid anaphylactoid shock. here we examined the mechanism underlying this shock. in non-primed mice, streptococcus intermedius k-213k (sik213) and streptococcus constellatus t21 (sct21) produced little or no sign of shock. in mdp-primed mice, sik213 caused lethal shock, while sct21 only had a weak effect. sik213 induced decreases in blood platelets and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht) preceding the shock, while the effects of sct21 were weak. the sik213-induced 5ht decrease and shock were reduced by a complement-c5 inhibitor. these results suggest that (i). streptococcal bacterial cells can induce rapid platelet responses, (ii). complement-dependent degradation of platelets may be involved in streptococcus-induced shock, (iii). the streptococcus-induced platelet degradation or degranulation may occur largely in the systemic circulation, and (iv). platelets may play a role not only in infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, but also in diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == genotyping by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis reveals persistence and recurrence of infection with streptococcus anginosus group organisms.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius, commonly referred to as the streptococcus anginosus group (sag), are commensal organisms known for their propensity to cause purulent infections which are difficult to eradicate. in this study, we determined the genetic similarities between sag isolates consecutively recovered from single patients to assess the duration of infection or colonization. a total of 97 sag isolates recovered from  30 patients were included; 65 (67.0%) of the isolates were abscess related. the isolates were identified by the 16s rrna reverse line blot hybridization assay as s. anginosus (n = 34), s. constellatus (n = 55), and s. intermedius (n = 8). amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) analysis of the sag isolates produced discriminatory and reproducible patterns. consecutive sag isolates with  identical aflp types were found in 27 of 30 (90.0%) patients, and consecutive isolates with only a single aflp type were demonstrated in 21 (70.0%) patients. the median delay between the times of recovery of the first and last isolates of  identical aflp types from each patient was 36 days, and this delay extended for more than 1 year in patients with both colonizing and abscess-related sag isolates. in six bacteremic patients, paired blood and nonblood sag isolates showed identical aflp types.

AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == streptococci and actinomyces induce antibodies which cross react with epithelial  antigens in periodontitis.
AB  == perturbation of epithelial structure is a prominent but poorly understood feature of the immunopathological response to bacterial antigens which characterizes the  destructive lesion of periodontitis. western analysis of sera from 22 patients with periodontitis detected multiple antigens in extracts of epithelial cells whereas sera from 12 periodontally healthy subjects displayed only trace reaction with epithelial antigens. to investigate a possible relationship between the bacterial flora adjacent to diseased sites and the presence of antibodies reactive with epithelium, subgingival plaque samples were taken from deep periodontal pockets and cultured anaerobically. gram positive bacteria containing antigens cross-reactive with epithelial cells were reproducibly isolated by probing membrane colony-lifts with affinity-isolated (epithelium-specific) antibodies and identified by 16s rdna sequence homology as streptococci (s. mitis, s. constellatus and two s. intermedius strains) and actinomyces (a. georgiae, and a. sp. oral clone). conversely, when serum from patients with periodontitis was absorbed with the captured bacterial species the number of epithelial antigens recognized was specifically reduced. it was concluded that development of cross-reactive antibodies related to these organisms may contribute to perturbation of the epithelial attachment to the tooth and the progression of periodontitis. these autoreactive antibodies could also be a contributing factor in other diseases affecting epithelia.

AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == identification of viridans streptococcal species causing bacterial meningitis in  adults in taiwan.
AB  == in order to determine the species responsible for viridans-group streptococcal meningitis in adults in taiwan, seven cases of culture-proven meningitis due to these organisms were studied. the cases were all identified at the chang gung memorial hospital-kaohsiung over a period of 3 years, and they accounted for 9% (7/78) of all cases of culture-proven bacterial meningitis occurring in adults during this period. of the seven viridans streptococci isolates recovered, streptococcus constellatus accounted for four, streptococcus anginosus for two, and streptococcus oralis for one. thus, it appears that streptococci of the milleri group are the most common species causing bacterial meningitis in adults  in taiwan. the tendency for these organisms to cause invasive central nervous system infections in adults should not be overlooked when these species are recovered from cerebrospinal fluid specimens.

TI  == actinomyces species, streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of actinomyces species,  streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples. all root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, actinomyces species in 9.4%, and e. faecalis in 7.5%. the most prevalent species were members of the streptococcus anginosus group. with regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most  prevalent species were s. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), e. faecalis (11.5%),  and s. anginosus (7.7%). s. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). the other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were a. gerencseriae (14.8%), s. gordonii (11.1%), s. intermedius (11.1%), a. israelii (7.4%), s. anginosus (7.4%), and s. sanguis (7.4%). s. constellatus was  the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).

TI  == [a three-year review of acute respiratory tract infections caused by streptococcus milleri group].
AB  == the objective of our study is to understand the clinical features of patients with acute respiratory tract infection associated with streptococcus milleri group (smg). fifteen patients with smg respiratory tract infection visited our hospital from july, 1997 through may, 2000. there were seven cases of pneumonia,  two pulmonary abscess, three thoracic empyema and three acute bronchitis. the mean age of the patients was 57.8 years (range 16-87), twelve were males, and seven were smokers. the moderately to severe underlying diseases existed in thirteen patients (86.7%) and included the following: respiratory diseases (20.0%), history of the esophageal or gastric surgery (26.7%), central nerve system diseases (13.3%), alcohol intake (60.0%), hepatitis and pancreatitis (33.3%), diabetes mellitus (13.3%) and malignancy (6.7%). the species of smg detected were as follows: s. constellatus, 8, s. anginosus, 6 and s. intermedius, 1. anaerobic organism and other microorganisms were detected in five patients. a  patient with smg nosocominal pneumonia who previously had thoracic surgery for esophageal cancer died. antibiotics therapy with carbapenem or combination therapy, drainage and no surgery, were successful in 14 of the 15 cases (93.3%).  the number of intermediately or complete resistant strains against penicillin g,  ampicillin and cefmetazole were 5 (33.3%), 8 (53.3%) and 12 (80.0%), respectively in this series. recently, it is seemed that acute respiratory tract infections caused by smg are increasing in the patients with moderately to severe underlying diseases, and several clinical strains of smg are acquiring a tolerance to antibiotics.

TI  == bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from pus specimens of orofacial odontogenic infections.
AB  == we recently reported the beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from pus specimens of 93  orofacial odontogenic infections. in this report, we determine the bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria other than anaerobic gram-negative rods, mainly gram-positive cocci, isolated from the same specimens. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros were frequent isolates from all types  of infection examined. peptostreptococcus prevotii, corynebacterium species, and  eubacterium species were recovered only from dentoalveolar infections, while gemella morbillorum was found more frequently in periodontitis than in the other  infections. beta-lactamase-positive strains were detected only in staphylococci.  ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefotaxime, imipenem, erythromycin,  clindamycin and levofloxacin showed high susceptibility rates (> or = 77%) against viridans streptococci, peptostreptococcus and gemella. minocycline showed a high mic90 value against viridans streptococci (32 microg/ml), and metronidazole was effective against peptostreptococcus and gemella. these results provide useful information for the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., a novel species isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis.
AB  == a bacterium was isolated from the blood culture of a patient with infective endocarditis. the cells were facultative anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive cocci arranged in chains. the bacterium grows on sheep blood agar as alpha-hemolytic, gray colonies of 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c in ambient air. growth also occurs in 10 or 40% bile and on bile esculin agar but not in 6% nacl. no enhancement of growth is observed in 5% co(2). it is nongroupable with lancefield groups a, b, c, d, f, or g antisera and is resistant to optochin and bacitracin. the organism is aflagellated and is nonmotile at both 25 and 37 degrees c. it is voges-proskauer  test positive. it produces leucine arylamidase and beta-glucosidase but not catalase, urease, lysine decarboxylase, or ornithine decarboxylase. it hydrolyzes esculin and arginine. it utilizes glucose, lactose, salicin, sucrose, pullulan, trehalose, cellobiose, hemicellulase, mannose, maltose, and starch. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were 3.6, 3.7, 4.3, 4.7, and 5.9% differences between the 16s rrna gene sequence of the bacterium and those of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus anginosus, respectively. the g+c content of it (mean plus minus standard deviation) was 53.0% plus minus 2.9%. based on phylogenetic affiliation, it belongs to the mitis or anginosus group of streptococcus. for these reasons a new species, streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., is proposed, for which hku4 is the type strain. further studies should be performed to ascertain the potential of this bacterium to become an emerging cause of infective endocarditis.

TI  == rapid identification of streptococcus intermedius by pcr with the ily gene as a species marker gene.
AB  == streptococcus intermedius belongs to the anginosus group of streptococci (ags) and is associated with endogenous infections leading to abscesses in the oral cavity and at deepseated sites, such as the brain and liver. two other species, s. anginosus and s. constellatus, and some presently unnamed taxa, are also classified as ags. recently, s. constellatus subsp. pharyngis, a new subspecies with biochemical characteristics similar to s. intermedius, was described with the potential for causing confusion when trying to identify isolates of these two species routinely with commercial identification kits, such as rapid id32 strep and fluo-card milleri. to correctly identify s. intermedius, this study attempted to develop an accurate pcr identification system with the ily gene as a species marker. this approach relies on amplification of an 819-bp fragment of the ily gene and its 3'-flanking region and is shown here to be specific for s. intermedius strains among all other streptococcal species. moreover, this pcr system was applicable in direct rapid pcr with whole bacterial cells and takara z-taq (takara), a highly efficient dna polymerase, as the template and dna amplification enzyme, respectively.

TI  == [clinical relevance of the streptococcus milleri group in head and neck infections].
AB  == streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, the 3 species of the s. milleri group, form part of the normal flora commonly found in the mouth,  throat, and gastrointestinal and genital tracts. this group has become known as an important pathogen in infections and abscesses, but data on the anatomical distribution of these species is lacking in relation to clinical significance. we obtained 275 strains of the s. milleri group from different departments at our hospital over the last 3 years, including 54 strains from dental surgery, 47 from internal medicine, 44 from otolaryngology (head and neck), 43 from surgery, 32 from gynecology, 17 from urology, 16 from dermatology, 11 from brain surgery, 6 from pediatrics, 3 from orthopedics, and 2 from opthalmology. the 44 strains from head and neck were found in 42 patients,--23 with primary infection and 19 with secondary infection induced by cancer treatments. the primary infection group included 4 deep neck abscesses, 1 peritonsillar abscess, 5 tonsillitis, 4 paranasal sinusitis, 3 congenital aural fistula infections, 2 dental infections,  2 paranasal sinus cysts, 1 supprative parotitis, and 1 postoperative wound infection. the secondary infection group included 7 postoperative wound infections, 3 postoperative pulmonary infections, 3 laryngitis and pharyngitis, 3 terminal pneumonias, and 3 infections of the local recurrence site. the s. milleri group was the only isolated organism in 13 cases (56.5%) of primary infection and in 5 (26.3%) of secondary infection. among other organisms from the primary infection group, no so-called major pathogens were found. antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the s. milleri group showed that 50% were resistant to ccl and 33% to ctm. abpc, cpdx, and cfdn were also found to be less sensitive, although no resistant strains were detected. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic atmosphere  is required, and differentiation of the 3 requires biochemical reactivity tests.  since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological examination, a considerable number of the s. milleri group could be missed in unknown species of alpha-,beta-, and gamma-streptococci and culture-negative cases. with antibiotics now being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in head and neck infections due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

AB  == the aim of the study was to isolate and identify at species level streptococci strains of anginosus group in pus samples collected from 110 patients with oral and maxillofacial (omf) infections. gram-stained smears and cultures on selective and nonselective media were done from each of the 111 pus samples (2 samples were collected from one of the patients, who presented 2 oral abscesses at the same time). the isolates were identified on the basis of cultural and biochemical characteristics. speciation of the anginosus group isolates was performed using the rapid id 32 strep system (bio merieux, france). fourty-four anginosus group strains were isolated from 42 patients. fourty of these isolates were identified  as streptococcus anginosus (2 nonidentical isolates were found in 2 patients), 3  isolates as streptococcus constellatus and only one as streptococcus intermedius. the study confirmed that the anginosus group is often involved in omf infections  alone or in association with other aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria. in the investigated cases, streptococcus anginosus was by far the most frequently isolated species within the anginosus group.

TI  == interaction between human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and streptococcus milleri  group bacteria.
AB  == because streptococcus milleri group (smg) bacteria--streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus anginosus--exhibit a striking propensity to cause abscesses, the interaction of these organisms with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) was examined. after incubation in pooled normal human serum, smg stimulated less chemotaxis than did staphylococcus aureus, in contrast to viridans streptococci, which caused greater chemotaxis than did s. aureus. pmnl ingested greater numbers of smg and viridans streptococci than s. aureus but killed these organisms more slowly and less completely. relative resistance to killing by pmnl is expected in organisms that  cause abscesses, and inhibition of chemotaxis may contribute to pathogenicity, because delayed arrival of pmnl gives a head start to proliferating bacteria. this study helps explain the capacity of smg to cause abscesses. it is unclear, however, why viridans streptococci, bacteria that rarely produce abscesses, share some of these same properties.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == [clinical significance of the streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  == few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. although streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. we studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000.  the streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by eikenella corrodens (9.7%), staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and s. pyogenes (3.2%). the s. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. these species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. since hemolytic patterns of the s. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. we found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the s. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. as antibiotics began  being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus anginosus ("streptococcus milleri group") are of different clinical importance and are not equally associated with abscess.
AB  == difficulties in distinguishing organisms of the "streptococcus milleri group" (smg; streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus anginosus), have caused ambiguity in determining their pathogenic potential. we reviewed 118 cases in which smg isolates had been identified using 16s rdna sequence. s. constellatus and s. anginosus were isolated far more frequently than was s. intermedius. nearly all isolates of s. intermedius and most isolates of s. constellatus, but only 19% of those of s. anginosus, were associated with abscess. our findings suggest that speciation of the smg may guide diagnostic evaluation, give insight into the possible role of coinfecting organisms, and help assess the need to search for occult abscess.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibilities of genetically characterized streptococcus milleri group strains.
AB  == previous studies of the antibiotic susceptibility of streptococcus milleri group  organisms have distinguished among species by using phenotypic techniques. using  44 isolates that were speciated by 16s rrna gene sequencing, we studied the mics  and minimum bactericidal concentrations of penicillin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin for streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus anginosus. none of the organisms was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, although a few isolates were intermediately resistant; one strain of s. anginosus was tolerant to ampicillin, and another was tolerant to ceftriaxone. six isolates were resistant to clindamycin, with representation from each of the  three species. relatively small differences in antibiotic susceptibilities among  species of the s. milleri group show that speciation is unlikely to be important  in selecting an antibiotic to treat infection caused by one of these isolates.

AB  == streptococcus salivarius, a gram-positive bacterium found in the human oral cavity, expresses flexible peritrichous fimbriae. in this paper, we report purification and partial characterization of s. salivarius fimbriae. fimbriae were extracted by shearing the cell surface of hyperfimbriated mutant a37 (a spontaneous mutant of s. salivarius atcc 25975) with glass beads. preliminary experiments showed that s. salivarius fimbriae did not dissociate when they were  incubated at 100 degrees c in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. this characteristic was used to separate them from other cell surface components by successive gel filtration chromatography procedures. fimbriae with molecular masses ranging from 20 x 10(6) to 40 x 10(6) da were purified. examination of purified fimbriae by electron microscopy revealed the presence of filamentous structures up to 1 microm long and 3 to 4 nm in diameter. biochemical studies of  purified fimbriae and an amino acid sequence analysis of a fimbrial internal peptide revealed that s. salivarius fimbriae were composed of a glycoprotein assembled into a filamentous structure resistant to dissociation. the internal amino acid sequence was composed of a repeated motif of two amino acids alternating with two modified residues: a/x/t-e-q-m/phi, where x represents a modified amino acid residue and phi represents a blank cycle. immunolocalization  experiments also revealed that the fimbriae were associated with a wheat germ agglutinin-reactive carbohydrate. immunolabeling experiments with antifimbria polyclonal antibodies showed that antigenically related fimbria-like structures were expressed in two other human oral streptococcal species, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus constellatus.

AB  == streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, the three species of the s. milleri group, form part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointenstinal tract, and genital tract. the s. milleri group has become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease, but little attention has been paid to their role in deep neck abscesses. we have treated 9 patients with deep neck abscesses relating to the s. milleri group since 1991, and regarded this group as an important pathogen also in these abscesses. we studied the frequency of the s. milleri group isolated from deep neck abscesses in our cases and from the literature and discuss clinical significance and bacteriological pathogenesis. cases numbered 27 treated at our facility since 1991 and 200 cases reported in the japanese literature since 1990. of our 9 cases, 4 originated from acute pharyngitis, 3 from peritonsillar abscesses, and 2 from odontogenic infection. serious complications such as mediastinitis, cervical necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation, and spondylitis of the cervical vertebrae were seen in 4 cases. among organisms isolated, the s. milleri group appeared to be a pathogen contributing to abscess formation and to serious complications. the genus streptococcus was most frequently isolated both in our 27 cases (66.7%) and the 200 in the literature (45.5%). among species of the genus streptococcus, the s. milleri group numbered the highest in our cases at 33.3% but only 8.5% in the literature. cases in the literature, however, contained many unknown species of streptococci--31.5% vs. 18.5% in our cases. alpha-streptococcus was frequently reported in the literature among unknown species of streptococci--36 of 63. culture-negative cases were also numbered more in the literature than in our case--29.0% vs. 18.5%. special conditions and procedures are required to suitably isolate and detect the s. milleri group. since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological examination, a considerable number of the s. milleri group could be missed in unknown species of streptococci or alpha-streptococcus and culture-negative cases. the detailed pathogenesis of the  s. milleri group remains to be clarified. infection by normal flora on mucosa is  thought to occur due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense in deep neck abscesses. some strains of the s. milleri group have been reported to produce many tissue-destroying enzymes such as collagenase and hyaluronidase. the co-existence of the s. milleri group with some anaerobe strains has also been suggested to accelerate inflammation. we discuss the mechanism inducing the massive release of cytokines through t cell response to certain exotoxins produced by s. milleri group, as reported in toxic shock-like syndrome due to the group a beta-streptococcus and in alpha-streptococcal shock syndrome due to viridans streptococci (alpha-streptococci).

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == the virulence of mixed infection with streptococcus constellatus and fusobacterium nucleatum in a murine orofacial infection model.
AB  == orofacial infections are usually polymicrobial, and it is the microbial interactions of pathogenic species that cause tissue destruction. in this study,  the microbial interaction between streptococcus constellatus and fusobacterium nucleatum was characterized using a murine orofacial infection model. a mixture of viable s. constellatus and f. nucleatum cells (both 2 x 10(8) cfu/mouse) was injected into the submandible; as a result, all of the test mice died. in contrast, none of the experimental animals monoinjected with either s. constellatus or f. nucleatum died (p<0.001), indicating that the synergism between the two resulted in the virulence. when a mixture of viable s. constellatus cells and a culture filtrate of f. nucleatum was tested, lethality and the bacterial cell count per lesion were significantly enhanced as compared with monoinjections (p<0.02). however, the virulence of f. nucleatum was not enhanced by infection of a culture filtrate of s. constellatus. the enhancement of virulence was observed even when viable s. constellatus cells and the culture  filtrate of f. nucleatum were injected at separate sites. heat treatment of the culture filtrate of f. nucleatum did not affect the enhancement. these results indicate that a heat-stable substance(s) produced by f. nucleatum contributes to  the microbial synergy of s. constellatus and f. nucleatum in orofacial infections.

TI  == strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric  species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

TI  == microbiological parameters associated with il-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == isolation of eikenella corrodens from polymicrobial hepatic abscess: report of one case.
AB  == eikenella corrodens is a rare cause of hepatic abscess. we report a case of a hepatic abscess caused by (1) bacteroides fragilis, (2) streptococcus constellatus and (3) e. corrodens, which illustrates potential problems of antibiotic coverage due to the presence of eikenella species. the infection followed an episode of acute gastroenteritis and the clinical course appeared indolent evolving over one week. besides empirical antibiotics, initial percutaneous aspiration was performed and yielded pus which grew e. corrodens concomitantly with streptococcus species. e. corrodens was sensitive to penicillin but resistant to clindamycin and metronidazole. but b. fragilis was resistant to penicillin. so the antibiotics were switched to amoxicillin/clavulanate. unfortunately fever persisted and the abscess increased  in size. therefore echo-guided percutaneous drainage with pigtail catheter was installed. fever subsided 5 days later. after 21 days treatment of antibiotics, the patient was discharged in good condition despite having some sterile fluid in the residual abscess cavity. two months after discharge the follow-up echogram confirmed complete resolution of the residual abscess. this patient shows us the  existence of e. corrodens in pediatric patients, especially when the hepatic abscess is very likely from the spread of an oral or abdominal infection.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == haemolytic activity of the streptococcus milleri group' and relationship between  haemolysis restricted to human red blood cells and pathogenicity in s. intermedius.
AB  == a collection of 297 clinically documented 'streptococcus milleri' strains, identified to the genotype level by 16s rrna gene hydridisation, was screened for haemolysis of human and animal red blood cells. forty-nine strains (65%) of the s. intermedius genotype displayed haemolysis restricted to human blood; they were named 'exclusive human haemolytic' (ehh) s. intermedius strains. the 26 remaining s. intermedius strains were named s. intermedius non-ehh strains. quantitative studies on the haemolysis indicated that intermedilysin was the factor involved.  the s. intermedius ehh strains represented the s. intermedius phenotype, whereas  the s. intermedius non-ehh strains were phenotypically characteristic of s. constellatus. the complete 16s rrna sequences of the s. intermedius ehh strains exhibited identity with s. intermedius strains atcc 27335 (= ncdo 2227, nctc 11324); the 16s rrna sequences of the s. intermedius non-ehh strains were identical to s. constellatus strain atcc 27823 (= ncdo 2226, nctc 11325) except for positions 228 and 229 that carried an s. intermedius sequence signature. the  16s sequence similarities between the non-ehh strains and the s. constellatus and the s. intermedius type strains were 99.5% and 98.6%, respectively. hybridisations of the complete 16s rrna genes with oligonucleotide probes indicated a 16s rrna homogeneity within the s. intermedius ehh and the non-ehh strains respectively. the s. intermedius ehh strains were isolated most frequently from infection- and abscess-related specimens. the present data emphasise the genetic variability within the s. constellatus species and redefine the s. intermedius species as a homogeneous group at the 16s rrna level.

TI  == distribution of the intermedilysin gene among the anginosus group streptococci and correlation between intermedilysin production and deep-seated infection with  streptococcus intermedius.
AB  == the distribution of intermedilysin, a human-specific cytolysin, among the anginosus group streptococci and the correlation of toxin production and infection by streptococcus intermedius were investigated. pcr and southern hybridization specific for the intermedilysin gene revealed that the toxin gene exists only in s. intermedius and no homologue to the toxin gene is distributed in s. anginosus and s. constellatus. thus, the intermedilysin gene is useful as a marker gene of s. intermedius. moreover, a human-specific hemolysis assay and western blotting with intermedilysin-specific antibodies clearly demonstrated that the intermedilysin production level in isolates from deep-seated infections, such as brain and liver abscesses, is higher (6.2- to 10.2-fold, respectively) than in strains from normal habitats, such as dental plaque, or from peripheral infection sites. however, other candidate virulence factors of s. intermedius, such as chondroitin sulfate depolymerase, hyaluronidase, and sialidase activities, did not show such a clear correlation between enzymatic activity and  isolation sites or disease severity. from these results, intermedilysin is likely to be the pathogenic or triggering factor of significance in inducing deep-seated infections with s. intermedius.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

AB  == beta-haemolytic, lancefield group c streptococci within the anginosus-species group were shown by genetic and phenotypic criteria to be heterogeneous and to constitute two distinct taxa related at subspecies level to streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus anginosus, respectively. the first group, referred to here as dna group 1, comprised six strains with 86-100% intragroup overall genomic dna relatedness; five of the strains were originally isolated from the human throat and one was from an abdominal mass. they shared 61-77% dna relatedness (delta tm values = 1.2-1.5 degrees c) with reference strains of s. constellatus and were clearly differentiated from s. constellatus (now named streptococcus constellatus subsp. constellatus) by the ability to produce beta-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-d-fucosidase,  beta-d-galactosidase and beta-d-glucosidase. the name s. constellatus subsp. pharyngis is proposed for these strains on the grounds that they are genetically  and phenotypically distinct and exhibit a predeliction for the human throat, being isolated also from cases of pharyngitis. the dna g + c content is 35-37 mol%. the type strain is mm9889at (= nctc 13122t). the second group (dna group 2) was formed by five beta-haemolytic, lancefield group c strains originally isolated from various human infections. dna group 2 strains (81-100% intragroup dna relatedness) shared 60-72% dna relatedness (delta tm values = 2.1-4.1 degrees c) with s. anginosus strains nctc 10713t and mas 283 but were not clearly differentiated phenotypically from s. anginosus, showed no clear pattern of clinical association, and therefore are not formally proposed as a new subspecies here.

AB  == we reviewed the medical records of 26 patients (median age 62 years, range 5-76 years) admitted to our institution during 1978-98 with acute bacterial meningitis (abm) caused by streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae (comprising 1.9% of all patients with abm). 19 cases were community-acquired and 7 were nosocomial. 73% had comorbid or predisposing conditions and 73% had an identifiable extracerebral focus; only in 2 patients no comorbid disease, primary focus or predisposing condition was present. five patients had cerebral abscesses, and 5 had endocarditis. beta-haemolytic streptococci were grown in 14  cases (serotype a: 4, b: 5, c: 1, g: 4) and were predominant among patients with  endocarditis, whereas alpha- or non-haemolytic strains grew in 12 cases (s. mitis: 4, s. constellatus: 2, e. faecalis: 2, s. bovis: 1, unspecified: 3) and were predominant in patients with a brain abscess. staphylococcus aureus grew together with a streptococcus in 2 cases. blood culture was positive in 9 cases (35%). neurologic complications occurred in 11 patients (42%) and extraneurologic complications in 18 patients (69%). adverse outcomes occurred in 10 patients (38%), including 3 patients who died. occurrence of seizures at any time of disease was significantly associated with an adverse outcome; no other clinical or paraclinical features appeared to affect outcome.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic characterization of "streptococcus milleri" group isolates from a veterans administration hospital population.
AB  == because identification of the species within the "streptococcus milleri" group is difficult for the clinical laboratory as the species share overlapping phenotypic characteristics, we wished to confirm biochemical identification with identification by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. ninety-four clinical isolates  previously identified as the "streptococcus milleri" group were reclassified as s. anginosus, s. constellatus, or s. intermedius with the api 20 strep system (biomerieux vikek, hazelton, mo.) and the fluo-card (key scientific, round rock,  tex.). in addition, we determined the lancefield group, hemolysis, colony size, colony texture, repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr (rep-pcr) pattern, and cellular fatty acid (cfa) profile (midi, newark, del.). 16s rrna gene sequence analysis with 40 selected representative strains showed three distinct groups, with s. constellatus and s. intermedius found to be more closely related to each  other than to s. anginosus, and further distinguished a biochemically distinct group of urogenital isolates within the s. anginosus group of isolates. except for strains unreactive with the fluo-card (8%), all s. anginosus and s. intermedius strains identified by sequencing were similarly identified by biochemical testing. however, 23% of the selected s. constellatus isolates identified by sequencing (9% of all s. constellatus isolates) would have been identified as s. anginosus or s. intermedius by biochemical tests. although most  s. anginosus strains formed one unique cluster by cfa analysis and most s. constellatus strains showed similar rep-pcr patterns, neither method was sufficiently dependable for identification. whereas lancefield group or lactose fermentation did not correspond to sequence or biochemical type, s. constellatus  was most likely to be beta-hemolytic and s. intermedius was most likely to have a dry colony type. the most frequent isolate in our population was s. constellatus, followed by s. anginosus. there was an association of s. anginosus with a gastrointestinal or urogenital source, and there was an association of s. constellatus and s. intermedius with both the respiratory tract and upper-body abscesses.

TI  == five-year analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility of the streptococcus milleri group.
AB  == susceptibility to 17 antibiotics was studied in 180 strains of the streptococcus  milleri group (88 streptococcus anginosus, 63 streptococcus constellatus, and 29  streptococcus intermedius) isolated over a 5-year period. minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin were in the intermediate range for 5.6% of the strains. resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was found in 17.1% and 16.6%  of the isolates, respectively. a steady increase in the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was observed over the study period. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam agent tested. glycopeptide antibiotics showed excellent activity. only slight differences between the three species were found in terms of antibiotic susceptibility. intermediate resistance to penicillin is appearing among the streptococcus milleri group in our area; consequently, care must be taken when choosing a macrolide for the management of infections caused by these  microorganisms.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora isolated from the female genital tract  activates hiv-1 expression.
AB  == alteration of cervicovaginal microbial flora can lead to vaginosis, which is associated with an increased risk of hiv-1 transmission. we recently characterized a soluble hiv-inducing factor (hif) from the cervicovaginal lavage  (cvl) samples of women. the goals of this study were to determine the effect of cervicovaginal microflora on hiv-1 expression and to elucidate the relationship between hif activity and microflora. physiologically relevant microorganisms, mycoplasma, diphtheroid-like bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus constellatus, cultured from the cvl of a representative woman with a clinical condition of bacterial vaginosis and possessing hif activity, induced hiv-1 expression. the magnitude of virus induction varied widely with the greatest stimulation induced by diphtheroid-like bacteria and mycoplasma. the transcriptional induction by mycoplasma was mediated by activation of the kb enhancer, an activation mechanism shared with hif. also as with hif, mycoplasma induced ap-1 dependent transcription. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based speciation showed that the isolate was m. hominis. our data  indicate that bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora can enhance hiv-1 transcription and replication and identify m. hominis as a potential source for hif activity. the virus-enhancing activities associated with the microflora and hif may increase genital tract viral load, potentially contributing to hiv transmission.

TI  == in vitro exchange of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci and genomic organization of the pare-parc region in s. mitis.
AB  == transfer of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci was explored by transformation in vitro. one-step fq-resistant parc mutants were selected, and resistance could be transferred from dna from s. oralis, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. constellatus to s. pneumoniae, with frequencies of 10(-3) to <10(-7) in correlation with the homologies of their quinolone resistance determining region sequences (95%, 91%,  85%, and 81%, respectively). reciprocal transfers of mutated parc from dna from s. pneumoniae to s. mitis and s. oralis were also observed. simultaneous transfer of mutated parc and gyra genes from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae yielded high-level-resistant pneumococcal transformants in one step at low frequencies. the pare-parc region of the type strain s. mitis 103335t had >90% homology with that of s. pneumoniae. the efficient interspecific transfer of quinolone resistance determinants in vitro leads us to anticipate their dissemination in the clinical setting.

TI  == abscess forming ability of streptococcus milleri group: synergistic effect with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the abscess forming abilities of "streptococcus milleri" strains (streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginiosus, and streptococcus intermedius) isolated from dentoalveolar abscesses and the synergistic effect of fusobacterium nucleatum co-inoculated with the isolates were examined on a mouse subcutaneous abscess model. five days after inoculation, all s. milleri strains formed abscesses, which showed less pathological spread to surrounding connective tissues than those formed by staphylococcus aureus 209p strain and were similar to those by f. nucleatum atcc25586. when each s. milleri strain and f. nucleatum  were co-inoculated, abscess sizes and each bacterial number recovered from abscesses increased in comparison to those treated by bacterial mono-inoculation  of each s. milleri strain or f. nucleatum alone. the strongest synergistic effect was observed in the combination of s. constellatus and f. nucleatum. in a time course experiment with this combination, the recovery of s. constellatus subsequently decreased after the decrement of f. nucleatum, and it appeared that  the association with f. nucleatum maintained the bacterial number of s. constellatus in the abscess. the cell-free supernatant of f. nucleatum had a tendency to increase the abscess size caused by s. constellatus in this model. when s. constellatus was cultured with f. nucleatum culture supernatant in vitro, growth enhancement in the early phase was observed. furthermore, the phagocytic killing of s. constellatus by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) was significantly suppressed and the pmn membranes appeared to be injured by addition of the f. nucleatum culture supernatant. these results suggest that the pathogenicity of s. milleri strains in odontogenic infections may be enhanced by  the co-existence of f. nucleatum.

TI  == effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

AB  == various serotypes reported in three serotyping systems for the 'streptococcus milleri' group, i.e., ottens i-iv, osano i-iv and serotypes a-k, were compared with each other in a capillary precipitation test and by the double immunodiffusion test. only two of the 19 serotypes, f and ottens-iii, were identical, and the other 17 serotypes were independent. thus, 18 serotypes and another three candidates (a-, b- and g-cross-reactive) were found in the 's. milleri' group. of the 248 strains tested, 197 were serotypable, and 23 strains carried two type antigens. generally, the ottens i, ii, iii (serotype f), iv and  osano iv antigens, often together with the lancefield group f antigen, were found in s. anginosus and s. constellatus. in addition, the serotype a, c, d, e and k antigens with the group a, c or g antigen were distributed in s. anginosus, the serotype b antigen in s. constellatus and the g, h, i, j, osano i, ii and iii antigens in s. intermedius. twenty-five of the untypable strains were lancefield  groupable (mostly f).

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

AB  == objective: to study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of bacteremia caused by streptococcus milleri group streptococci (smg). methods: prospective evaluation of all bacteremic episodes with clinical significance from 1990 to 1995 in two general hospitals. in this study all episodes caused by smg were analyzed. results: a total of 905 bacteremic episodes with clinical significance were detected; 18 (1.98%) were caused by smg (0.16/1,000 admissions). the mean age of patients were 43 years and the male/female ratio 1.6. seventeen patients (94.4%) had some underlying disease; nine patients had diabetes, four were parenteral drug abusers, and two had neoplasms. the most common sources of bacteremia were intraabdominal in four episodes (two liver abscesses, one subphrenic abscess and one pancreatic pseudocyst), cutaneous and/or soft tissues in four, surgical wound in two and respiratory in two; no source was identified in five episodes. four episodes had a polymicrobial origin. in 13 isolates the identification was at species level (streptococcus anginosus eight, streptococcus intermedius four and streptococcus constellatus one). all strains were susceptible to penicillin. six patients (33.3%) required surgery. in ten episodes a favorable outcome was recorded, although four patients required surgery. the infection associated mortality rate was 31.2%. the mean age of deceased patients was higher than for cured patients (62.2 +/- 20.2 versus 35.3 +/- 20.3; p < 0.05). conclusions: smb bacteremia is uncommon. it involved mainly  diabetic patients or parenteral drug abusers, commonly with an intraabdominal suppurative source or in skin or soft tissues. the mortality rate was high despite surgery in one third of patients. patients with advanced age had a poorer prognosis. all isolates investigated were susceptible to penicillin.

TI  == characterization of the lancefield group c streptococcus 16s-23s rna gene intergenic spacer and its potential for identification and sub-specific typing.
AB  == the 16s-23s rna gene intergenic spacers of isolates of streptococcus equi (n = 5), s. zooepidemicus (n = 5), s. equisimilis (n = 3) and s. dysgalactiae (n = 2)  were sequenced and compared. there were distinct regions within the spacer, arranged in the order 1-9 for all s. equi and one s. zooepidemicus isolate and 1,2 and 4-9 for the remaining isolates. region 4 was identical to the trna(ala) gene found in the 16s-23s intergenic spacers of other streptococci. regions 1, 5, 6 and 7 had distinct variations, each conserved in different isolates. however, amongst the intergenic spacers there were different combinations of variant regions, suggesting a role for dna recombination in their evolution. the intergenic spacer of all isolates of s. equi and one s. zooepidemicus isolate were almost identical. primers derived from the variant sequences of regions 1 and 5 to 6 were used to group all s. zooepidemicus (n = 17) and s. equi (n = 5) into 1 of 8 types by polymerase chain reaction; three s. zooepidemicus isolates typed the same as s. equi. s. equi and s. zooepidemicus were clearly distinguishable from s. equisimilis and s. dysgalactiae which had shorter regions 5 and 6 and no region 7. most homology for the group c sequences was found in previously published sequences for the 16s-23s intergenic spacers of s. anginosis, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. salivarius and s. agalactiae. a 75-90 nucleotide length shared with s. anginosus and s. intermedius in opposite orientations in the two main variants of region 6 supported the role for dna recombination in the evolution of the spacer. the 16s-23s intergenic spacers indicate that s. zooepidemicus was the archetypal species for s. equi and that both are genetically more distant from s. equisimilis and s. dysgalactiae. the intergenic spacer can be used to identify specifically the group c streptococci and as an epidemiological marker for s. zooepidemicus.

TI  == [evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the enterococcus genus].
AB  == background: the evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in nacl esculin broth and group d antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the enterococcus genus were performed. methods: one hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 8 e. faecium, 3 e. avium, 16 streptococcus  intermedius, 7 s. salivarius, 4 s. bovis, 4 s. constellatus, 2 s. sanguis and 1 strain of s. equinus, s. mitis, s. uberis and s. mutans were studied. the tests used were: rapid test in nacl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup d streptococcus agglutination (patho dx strep d/pyr; diagnostic product corporation). all catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the enterococcus genus. the usefulness of gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. results: the results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. no significant differences were observed between the results obtained with gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the streptococcus mutans strain. conclusions: the application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group d agglutination and rapid test in nacl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the enterococcus genus.

TI  == utilization of sialic acid by viridans streptococci.
AB  == the importance of viridans streptococci as agents of serious extra-oral diseases, including endocarditis, is now recognized. we have tested the hypothesis that the ability to utilize sialic acid as a nutrient source may play a role in the proliferation of these organisms. the type strains of the 15 presently recognized species of viridans streptococci and two clinical isolates-s. oralis (ar3), isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis, and s. intermedius (uns35),  a brain abscess isolate-were studied for their ability to utilize sialic acid. only s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. mitis ("oralis group") s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus ("milleri group"), and s. defectivus ("nutritionally variant group") were able to use sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic  acid) efficiently as a sole carbon source. formate, acetate, and ethanol were produced as the major metabolic end-products of sialic acid metabolism, while corresponding glucose-grown cultures produced lactate as the major metabolic end-product. utilization of sialic acid was independent of the production of sialidase. cell-free extracts of sialic acid-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of n-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (npl; the first enzyme in the intracellular catabolism of sialic acid) and n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (glcnac-6-p) deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate (glcn-6-p) deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of n-acetylglucosamine). these  activities were repressed by growth in the presence of glucose. the intracellular fate of sialic acid, after cleavage by npl into n-acetylmannosamine (mannac) and  pyruvate, is uncertain, but the elevated levels of glcnac-6-p deacetylase and glcn-6-p deaminase in sialic acid-grown cells suggest that phosphorylation and isomerization are possible steps in the metabolism of mannac to generate an intermediate common to the pathway of n-acetylglucosamine metabolism. the species of viridans streptococci that have the ability to utilize sialic acid are those most commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, and this ability is likely to  play a role in the persistence and survival of these infecting organisms in vivo.

TI  == rapid species identification of "streptococcus milleri" strains by line blot hybridization: identification of a distinct 16s rrna population closely related to streptococcus constellatus.
AB  == a collection of 399 "streptococcus milleri" strains were identified to the species level by the use of a line blot assay. their pcr-amplified partial 16s rrna gene sequences were hybridized with species-specific 5'-biotinylated oligonucleotide probes homologous to the bp 213 to 231 regions of the 16s rrna gene sequences of the type strains streptococcus anginosus atcc 33397, streptococcus constellatus atcc 27823, and streptococcus intermedius atcc 27335.  the hybridization results were compared with the reference phenotypic identification method data (r. a. whiley, h. fraser, j. m. hardie, and d. beighton, j. clin. microbiol. 28:1497-1501, 1990). most strains (357 of 399 [89.5%]) reacted unambiguously with only one probe. however, 42 of the 399 strains (10.5%) reacted with both the s. constellatus- and s. intermedius-specific probes; 41 of them were phenotypically identified as s. constellatus. these dually reactive strains hybridized with a 5'-biotinylated probe based on the bp 213 to 231 region of the 16s rrna gene sequence of one of two species. analysis of the 5' ends of the 16s rrna gene sequences (487 bp) demonstrated that the dually reactive strains represent a distinct rrna population sharing 98.1% sequence similarity with s. constellatus. phenotypic consistency between the dually reactive strains and the s. constellatus strains was not demonstrated. line blot hybridization proved to be a simple and inexpensive method to screen large numbers of strains for genetic relatedness, and it allowed the detection of a distinct 16s rrna type within the "s. milleri"  group.

TI  == interactions between eikenella corrodens and 'streptococcus milleri-group' organisms: possible mechanisms of pathogenicity in mixed infections.
AB  == interactions between the 'streptococcus milleri-group' organisms (smg; s. intermedius, s. constellatus and s. anginosus) and eikenella corrodens were investigated. coaggregation reactions occurred frequently between s. anginosus (83% of strain combinations) or s. constellatus (87%) and e. corrodens isolates,  but were infrequent between s. intermedius and e. corrodens (28%). no enhancement of enzyme activities against lipid, phosphate, peptide and saccharide substrates  tested were detected with combinations of species in comparison to the species alone. exponential growth of s. constellatus and s. intermedius, in mixed culture with e. corrodens, occurred within 6h post inoculation, in comparison to 25h without e. corrodens. no growth stimulation of s. anginosus was observed. it is concluded that both coaggregation and growth stimulation occur between e. corrodens and smg isolates, and may be important mechanisms in the establishment  of mixed infections involving these bacteria.

AB  == a collection of 423 clinical "streptococcus milleri' strains was speciated and tested for susceptibilities to twelve antibiotics. only 1.4% of the strains were  of intermediate susceptibility to penicillin. none of the strains exhibited high-level resistance to gentamicin. strains resistant to erythromycin, roxithromycin and clindamycin were found with a frequency of 2.6%, 2.4% and 2.4%  respectively. doxycycline resistance was found in 5.7% of the strains and occurred most frequently in streptococcus anginosus. all the strains were susceptible to cefotaxime, vancomycin and teicoplanin. the results of this study  do not indicate changing antibiotic resistance in strains of the "s. milleri' group, but local differences in antibiotic susceptibilities may occur.

TI  == the streptococcus milleri group as a cause of pulmonary infections.
AB  == streptococci that colonize the mouth and upper respiratory tract tend to be considered harmless commensals. in 45 cases of acute pneumonia and/or pulmonary abscess and 25 cases of thoracic empyema, the predominant species recovered were  anaerobic bacteria and the streptococcus milleri group, which encompasses the oral species streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. the isolation of most s. milleri organisms along with  oral anaerobes indicated synergy between these groups. studies in a mouse model of pneumonia demonstrated this synergy; mortality was higher, histopathologic abnormalities were more marked (reflecting acute pneumonia followed by pulmonary  abscess or empyema), and viable bacteria were more numerous in the lungs of mice  with mixed infections caused by the s. milleri group and anaerobes than in the lungs of those with monomicrobial infection. in vitro studies elucidated a possible mechanism of this synergistic effect: anaerobes may enhance the growth of the s. milleri group and/or inhibit the bactericidal activity of the host. we  conclude that the s. milleri group is more important in pulmonary infections than has previously been recognized.

TI  == potential pathogenic properties of members of the "streptococcus milleri" group in relation to the production of endocarditis and abscesses.
AB  == the "streptococcus milleri" (smg) group have been shown to possess factors in vitro that may be involved in pathogenesis. all smg strains are able to bind fibronectin via a cell-surface protein; the binding ranged from 12 to 198 mol/cell. strains also bound to platelet-fibrin or fibrin clots and fibrinogen, giving maximum adhesion values of 16.5%, 21.8% and 151 mol/cell respectively. members of the species s. constellatus produced thrombin-like activity. lancefield group c smg aggregated rat platelets, a bacterial cell-surface protein acting as mediator in the reaction. most of the in-vitro factors did not correlate with each other, an indication that smg strains possess a wide variety  of pathogenic properties that may be involved in the production of abscesses or endocarditis. however, there was a correlation between the binding of large amounts of fibrinogen ( > 100 mol/cell) and the ability to aggregate platelets. this suggests that fibrinogen binding may aid in platelet aggregation.

AB  == eight cases of infection caused by streptococcus milleri were studied clinically, and a comparative study was made of the backgrounds and factors influencing the development of infectious diseases caused by streptococcus milleri and streptococcus pneumoniae. the patients (six males and two females) with infectious diseases caused by streptococcus milleri ranged in age from 21 to 81 years old with an average age of 62.0 years. the infectious diseases encountered  among the patients were pyothorax in three patients, and in one patient each pyothorax and lung abscess, pleurisy, a secondary infection of pulmonary emphysema, skin infection related to a tracheostomy, a subdural abscess and a brain abscess, respectively. six out of the eight cases had infections which formed pus. an underlying disease existed in seven cases, and, in five of these seven cases, it influenced the general condition of these patients. six serum antibody titers for the s. milleri groups were examined in the first department of internal medicine, university of the ryukyus. three cases for s. anginosus, two cases for s. intermedius, and one case for s. constellatus showed high titers of x1024 or x2048. therefore, the examination of the serum antibody titer seems useful for the diagnosis of infections caused by the s. milleri group. we also carried out a comparative investigation of the backgrounds and factors of infectious diseases caused by s. milleri and s. pneumoniae. there are more underlying diseases in infections caused by s. milleri than in those caused by s. pneumoniae. there were more smokers among the patients with infections caused by  s. milleri than among those with s. pneumonia infections.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == over a 4-year-period, 104 isolates belonging to the viridans streptococci were recovered from the blood and identified to the species according to beighton and  co-workers. streptococcus oralis was the species most frequently recovered from patients in the hematology unit [29 of 39 (74%)]. streptococcus mitis ranked second [seven of 39 (18%)]. both species were associated with oromucositis. isolates presently identified as s. oralis are mainly those previously identified as s. mitis or streptococcus sanguis ii. streptococcus milleri was most frequently isolated in the patients from the general hospital population [28 of 65 (43%) isolates]: streptococcus anginosus (n = 20), streptococcus constellatus  (n = 4), and streptococcus intermedius (n = 4). in 14 episodes from the general hospital population, clinical significance was judged questionable. from this part of the laboratory, clinical significance could not be predicted from the number of blood cultures grown, nor from the delay of growth detection. the rapid id 32 strep system agreed well with the identifications according to the scheme of beighton et al., whereas the api 20 strep system did not.

AB  == the importance of bacterial vaginosis as a risk factor in obstetric and gynecological infections has recently been recognized. the bacterial vaginosis group of organisms includes members of the streptococcus milleri group, the identification of which has caused much confusion. we prospectively surveyed the  rates of carriage of s. milleri group organisms in 397 high vaginal swabs received in our laboratory. for the identification of 99 clinical isolates and 23 control strains, we compared the results obtained by the rapid id 32 strep system (analytab products) and by a scheme utilizing six differential phenotypic characteristics (presence of beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-d-fucosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, and beta-glucosidase) as described by whiley et al. (r. a. whiley, h. fraser, j. m. hardie, and d. beighton, j. clin. microbiol. 28:1497-1501, 1990). we identified streptococcus anginosus in 18% and streptococcus constellatus in 0.05% of the specimens examined. of the isolates of s. anginosus that reacted with grouping antisera, 20 of 25 belonged to lancefield group f. the incubation conditions for  bacterial cultures and for reaction mixtures affected the results of phenotypic characterization in the production of alpha-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, and  beta-glucosidase. however, by using bacterial cultures grown under hypercapnic conditions and incubating the reaction mixtures aerobically, consistent phenotypic characteristics were obtained, allowing identification similar to that obtained by the id 32 strep system. we therefore recommend the phenotypic scheme  as an inexpensive, reliable, and convenient method for the initial identification of species of the s. milleri group.

TI  == heterogeneity among 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacers of species within the 'streptococcus milleri group'.
AB  == the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer has been suggested as a suitable region of the bacterial genome from which to derive useful taxonomic information, particularly  with regard to identification at the species level. to investigate this approach  as an aid to the identification of the three species comprising the 'streptococcus milleri group' (smg), the spacers of isolates of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus constellatus were amplified by pcr and length polymorphisms determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. phenotypically atypical isolates which had been identified presumptively as belonging to these three species were also included. spacers from two representatives of each spacer length found within the three smg species were sequenced. 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer length polymorphisms allowed discrimination between s. anginosus (350 bp or 450 bp amplification product) and  s. constellatus (380 bp amplification product), species that are difficult to differentiate phenotypically. s. intermedius (330 bp or 450 bp amplification product) and s. anginosus (350 bp or 450 bp amplification product) were not reliably distinguished by this method but are phenotypically distinct. sequencing data demonstrated that the spacers had a central region of highly variable length flanked by conserved regions which included a single trna(ala) gene. polymorphism in the length of the 16s-23s spacer determined by pcr provides a rapid and useful adjunct to strain identification for s. anginosus and s. constellatus, which are  not readily differentiated phenotypically.

AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (cmx), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cmx and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from october of 1993 to march of 1994. the results are summarized as follows; 1.  cmx showed strong antimicrobial activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. antimicrobial activities of cmx against benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) and pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc), and these strong activities suggested that cmx might have strong antimicrobial activities against  beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis. 2. antimicrobial  activities of cmx against microaerophiles, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius and gemella morbillorum and against peptostreptococcus  spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. the mic90's of cmx against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. these values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% cmx nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. it appears likely  that sufficient concentrations exceeding mics against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using cmx nasal solution.

AB  == the pathogenicity of streptococcus constellatus in pulmonary infections was investigated in mice in correlation with the phagocytic killing of the microorganisms by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns). the histological inflammation score of the lungs in mice inoculated intratracheally with 10(8) cfu/mouse of the virulent strain s. constellatus rzyk001 obtained from bronchoalveolar fluid of a patient with pneumonia, was significantly higher than  in mice inoculated with the avirulent strains s. constellatus rt4303 and rt6002 obtained from saliva of healthy adults (p < 0.001). the bactericidal activity of  human pmns against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 was not inhibited at all by the culture filtrate of the virulent strain, but the killing index against rzyk001 was 36.4% after 90-min incubation whereas that against rt4303 and rt6002  was 94.7% and 99.4%, respectively (p < 0.001). therefore, these results suggest a possible pathogenic mechanism of s. constellatus apparently mediated by a structural component of the organisms so that a virulent strain is less likely to be killed than an avirulent one, predisposing it to survive in the infection sites.

AB  == objectives: interstitial cystitis (ic) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder of unknown etiology. we tested the hypothesis that a microorganism would  be found at higher prevalence in urine or bladder tissue from women with ic than  from control women. methods: urine and bladder tissue were obtained at cystoscopy from 11 ic patients and 7 control subjects. these specimens were cultured for a variety of fastidious and nonfastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. in addition, special staining techniques were used to examine biopsy specimens and cytospun urine, and tissue sections and outgrowths of explanted bladder cells were examined by electron microscopy. results: cultures of urine from 6 of 11 ic patients grew five different bacteria (corynebacterium sp. klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus sp, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus morbillorum), human cytomegalovirus, or torulopsis glabrata; one of these organisms (lactobacillus sp) was found in urine from 2 patients. although contamination by urethral organisms is possible, the prevalence of microorganisms in urine of ic patients (6 of 11) was significantly greater than in urine of control subjects (0 of 7) (p < 0.05). acridine orange staining revealed rods with appropriate morphology in urine from 4 of the 5 ic patients who had positive bacterial cultures and yeastlike organisms in urine and bladder tissue specimens  that grew torulopsis. additionally, rodlike organisms were seen in urine from 2 ic patients with negative bacterial cultures and cocci were seen in the urine of  1 control patient. biopsy specimens from 2 ic patients grew torulopsis sp or lactobacillus sp, in agreement with the results of acridine orange staining and culture of urine from these patients; in contrast, specimens from 3 control subjects grew small numbers of pseudomonas sp or staphylococcus epidermidis, but  no organisms were cultured from urine or seen in acridine orange-stained tissue smears. all other cultures and stains were negative. conclusions: these data do not provide evidence that ic is associated with infection or colonization by a single microorganism. however, they do generate the hypothesis that the prevalence of microorganisms, especially bacteria at low concentrations, is greater in the urine of ic patients than of control subjects. if these results are confirmed by other controlled studies, the question of whether the presence of these organisms is a cause or a result of ic should be addressed.

TI  == microaerophilic streptococcal infection in children.
AB  == a total of 148 isolates of microaerophilic streptococci (ms) (47 streptococcus constellatus, 43 streptococcus intermedius and five gemella morbillorum) were cultured from 123 children. there were predisposing conditions in 47 (38%) patients of which most common were previous surgery (14), trauma (11), malignancy (9) diabetes (6) and immunodeficiency (5). ms were the only bacteria isolated from 12 (10%) patients and mixed infections were encountered in 111, when the number of isolates varied between two and seven (average 3.0) isolates per specimen. the bacteria most commonly isolated with ms were anaerobic cocci (70 isolates), bacteroides fragilis group (54), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas (34) and escherichia coli (26). most b. fragilis and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections, and those of skin and soft tissue adjacent to the rectum. most pigmented prevotella and fusobacteria were isolated  from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, head and neck sites. most ms were recovered from abscesses (43%), the abdominal cavity (17%), sinuses (10%) and chest infections (9%). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients, in 61 this was combined with surgical drainage or correction. three patients died. these data illustrate that ms can occasionally be associated with infection in children.

TI  == a mechanism of pathogenicity of "streptococcus milleri group" in pulmonary infection: synergy with an anaerobe.
AB  == the relationship between streptococcus constellatus, one of the species of the "streptococcus milleri group", and prevotella intermedia was studied in a model of pneumonia in mice and in vitro to elucidate mechanisms of pathogenicity in "s. milleri group"-associated pulmonary infection. acute pneumonia with or without empyema and lung abscess in mice with mixed infection resulted in 60% mortality rate, but there was only 10% mortality and mild pneumonia in each separate infection. bacterial clearance of organisms, especially s. constellatus, in mixed infection was delayed. enhancement of growth of s. constellatus was demonstrated  when cultured with p. intermedia; growth was also stimulated by a culture filtrate of p. intermedia which also inhibited bactericidal activity of human neutrophils. in an examination of infectivity and bacterial clearance of s. constellatus with p. intermedia culture filtrate in vivo, there was 20% mortality and delayed clearance of s. constellatus, although the infection was not as severe as that produced by the combination of both organisms. these results suggest that p. intermedia may act with s. constellatus in the production of pulmonary infections by stimulating its growth and suppressing bactericidal activity of the host.

TI  == conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin g-cross-reactive domains of antigen i/ii in oral streptococci.
AB  == in this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin g (higg)-cross-reacting domains on the sr molecule,  an antigen i/ii-related protein from s. mutans serotype f. mapping of the sr molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the n-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the sr molecule. in order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans  group and 11 nonmutans oral streptococcus strains (s. anginosus, s. milleri, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. salivarius, and s. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using dna probes  designed to map these two regions. all the mutans group strains except s. rattus  and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the c-terminal part of the sr molecule, especially the higg-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the n-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with sr from s. mutans serotype f, p1 from s. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the higg-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the c  and n termini and in the proline-rich repeats. these results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-igg antibodies.

TI  == mucin-sulphatase activity of some oral streptococci.
AB  == mucin-sulphatase activity, measured using a 35s-[so4(2-)]-labelled colonic mucin  substrate, was detected in whole cells of streptococci isolated from the human oral cavity. the highest levels of sulphatase activity were found in all strains  of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and in half of the strains of streptococcus mutans tested. little or no activity was detected in 9 of the 11 streptococcus oralis strains examined, in the 4 streptococcus constellatus strains, and in the 3 streptococcus anginosus isolates tested. the highest enzyme levels were obtained from the two fresh streptococcus gordonii isolates. this is  the first report of such activity in oral microorganisms. streptococcal mucin-sulphatase may contribute to the destruction of salivary mucins and mitigate their protective functions in the oral cavity, and be a determinant in the development of dental caries.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  == three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (actinomyces, streptococcus, staphylococcus, prevotella, and actinobacillus). nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four prevotella denticola strains, two actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of p. melaninogenica,  streptococcus constellatus, and a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. with one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the s. constellatus isolate. genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in escherichia coli using pbr322. hemolytic clones  were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three p. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. two of the p. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 kb inserts. the clone derived from the third  strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 kb region, but the flanking dna showed no homology even though all three p. denticola isolates were  shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == streptococcus milleri group: renewed interest in an elusive pathogen.
AB  == the following review examines the bacteriological characteristics, epidemiology,  pathogenicity and antimicrobial susceptibility of the "streptococcus milleri group". "streptococcus milleri group" is a term for a large group of streptococci which includes streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus anginosus. usually considered commensals, these organisms are often associated with various pyogenic infections including cardiac, abdominal, skin and central nervous system infections. organisms of the "streptococcus milleri group" are often unrecognized pathogens due to the lack of uniformity in classifications and difficulties in microbiological identification. penicillin g, cephalosporins, clindamycin and vancomycin all possess activity against these streptococci. use of agents with poor activity may promote infections with "streptococcus milleri group" and allow it to exhibit its pathogenicity. an understanding of these organisms may aid in their recognition and proper treatment.

TI  == immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.

(int. j. syst. bacteriol. 37:222-228, 1987). however, recent data from dna-dna hybridization experiments, whole-cell-derived polypeptide patterns determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and data from phenotypic testing have demonstrated that streptococcus anginosus strains represent three readily identifiable taxa to which the previously assigned type strains of streptococcus constellatus (strain ncdo 2226 [= atcc 27823], streptococcus intermedius (strain ncdo 2227 [= atcc 27335], and streptococcus anginosus (strain nctc 10713 [= atcc 33397] have been shown to belong. therefore, we propose recognition of streptococcus constellatus (emend.)

AB  == a biochemical scheme was developed by which strains of streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus anginosus can reliably be distinguished from within the "streptococcus milleri group." strains identified as s. intermedius were differentiated by the ability to produce detectable levels of alpha-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-d-fucosidase, beta-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase with  4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates in microdilution trays after 3 h of incubation at 37 degrees c, together with the production of hyaluronidase. strains of s. constellatus and s. anginosus were differentiated by the production of alpha-glucosidase and hyaluronidase by the former and the production of beta-glucosidase by the latter. the majority of strains of the s. milleri group obtained from dental plaque were identified as s. intermedius, as were most strains isolated from abscesses of the brain and liver. strains of s. constellatus and s. anginosus were from a wider variety of infections, both oral  and nonoral, than were strains of s. intermedius, with the majority of strains from urogenital infections being identified as s. anginosus.

AB  == employing twenty fresh oral isolates of streptococcus intermedius, studies were carried out to characterize serological relations among the isolates and also between the isolates and the strains of bacterial species closely related to s. intermedius. the rantz-randall extracts from the cells were used as antigens. the anti-rabbit serum raised against s. intermedius atcc 27335t reacted with the cell extracts from only three strains of the isolates, which were designated serogroup i strains. the other isolates were classified into four serogroups, i, iii, iv, and v, which specifically reacted with the cell extracts from the homologous serogroup strains. however, the serogroup ii antiserum formed in immunodiffusion  a common precipitin line between the extracts from the cells of serogroups ii and i. the serogroups i, iii, iv, and v antisera reacted with none of the extracts from the bacterial cells closely related to s. intermedius, which included streptococcus anginosus atcc 33397t, streptococcus constellatus atcc 27823t, three nctc strains of "streptococcus milleri," and three atcc strains of streptococcus mg. the precipitin line formed by the homologous reaction of the serogroup ii antiserum was found to be a reaction of identity with that formed by the extract from "s. milleri" nctc 10708. conversely, the antiserum against nctc  10708 strain did not react with the cell extracts of serogroup ii.

TI  == dna-dna hybridization studies and phenotypic characteristics of strains within the 'streptococcus milleri group'.
AB  == twenty-five strains resembling 'streptococcus milleri' were compared by dna-dna hybridization, by whole-cell-derived polypeptide patterns on sds-page, and by biochemical tests. four homology groups were revealed by dna-dna hybridization. dna homology groups 1, 2 and 3 were closely related and contained the type strains ncdo 2226 (streptococcus constellatus), ncdo 2227 (streptococcus intermedius) and nctc 10713 (streptococcus anginosus), respectively. dna homology group 4 consisted of four strains received as variants of streptococcus intermedius which were found not to be closely related to strains in groups 1-3.  the data from sds-page polypeptide patterns and biochemical tests supported the recognition of three centres of variation within the 'streptococcus milleri group' corresponding to dna homology groups 1-3 and indicated that strains of dna homology group 4 are members of an as yet undescribed species within the viridans streptococci.

TI  == classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  == this review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. the goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. this method has resulted in the division of some species. streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common  in humans. three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. conversely, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, and "s. milleri" have been combined under s. anginosus. s. mitis (or "s. mitior") can be well-defined and includes s. sanguis  ii. there is genetic heterogeneity within s. sanguis, but the species is usually  easy to identify. there is also some heterogeneity in s. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.

TI  == a qualitative and quantitative study of the cellular fatty acids of 'streptococcus milleri' with capillary gas chromatography.
AB  == fatty acid analysis was done with gc and gc-ms on 21 strains of 'streptococcus milleri', representative of the various proposed species. although no qualitative differences were found in the fatty acid profiles, discriminant analysis of the quantitative data revealed three groups. streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus constellatus were indistinguishable but separated from the other two groups which comprised streptococcus intermedius, with a wide fermentation pattern and streptococcus intermedius with a narrow fermentation pattern. three of the strains could be distinguished from the others by a 'fingerprint' of a particularly prominent fatty acid peak. the results support the suggestion that there is more than one species in this group of organisms and that the technique  might be of value in epidemiological investigations of 's. milleri'.

TI  == [taxonomic studies of the streptococcus intermedius strains isolated from human oral cavities].
AB  == human oral isolates of streptococcus intermedius, which were biochemically identified, have been classified into 5-serogroups (i-v). selecting some representive stock cultures together with the type strain atcc 27335, comparisons were carried out between them in terms of cell extractable proteins, g + c mol% values, dna-dna homology and dna restriction fragments. since the taxon of s. intermedius has not been clarified, comparison was also made between the above strains and the type strains of the "streptococcus anginosus-milleri group", streptococcus anginosus, "streptococcus milleri" and streptococcus constellatus,  which were thought to be related to s. intermedius. 1. g + c mol% of s. intermedius atcc 27335 was 38.0 +/- 0.28. the values of all the isolates tested ranged from 37.0 to 38.8. on the other hand, the values of the type strains of the "s. anginosus-milleri group" were 38.0-38.8. 2. under stringent conditions of dna-dna hybridization, all the isolates showed more than 66.7% homology with s. intermedius atcc 27335, demonstrating that these strains belonged to the same species. on the other hand, s. anginosus atcc 33397, "s. milleri" nctc 11169 and  s. constellatus atcc 27823 hybridized at levels of 50%, 53% and 28%, respectively. consequently, it was impossible to classify these strains as being  the same species as s. intermedius. 3. when the dna restriction fragments were compared by page, the strains of serogroups i and v showed the same pattern, respectively. the strains of serogroups ii and iii, however, showed two different patterns, and these of serogroup iv showed five different patterns. dna fragments specific to s. intermedius could not be identified. 4. when cell extractable groups were compared by sds-page, the strains of serogroups i and v showed identical patterns. the strains of serogroup iii showed 2 different patterns and  those of serogroup iv showed 5 patterns. these results reflected those of the dna restriction analysis. however, the strains of serogroup ii showed the same protein pattern, although 2 different patterns were observed in dna restriction fragments. unique proteins, which were not detected in the proteins extracted from the type strains of the "s. anginosus-milleri group", were observed in the cell proteins of s. intermedius strains. 5. the results of dna-dna hybridization  and the existence of unique extractable proteins together with the chondroitinase productivity suggest that the strains of s. intermedius might represent a particular taxon among the strains of the "s. anginosus-milleri group".(abstract  truncated at 400 words)

TI  == speciation of viridans streptococci & their significance in human infections.
AB  == sixty strains of viridans streptococci recovered, from various infections, encountered in a large referral hospital in tamil nadu (south india) from december 1983 to may 1985 were characterised by conventional tests. of these, 57  (95%) belonged to four species viz., sanguis ii, mitis, intermedius and constellatus. of the 40 strains that were assessed for their clinical significance, 23 (57.5%) were found to be either significant or of suggestive significance. the study suggested viridans streptococci are not particularly virulent pathogens. but local/systemic factors were found to predispose the subjects to this infection.

TI  == identification of viridans streptococci by three commercial systems.
AB  == the api 20s (analytab products, plainview, ny), the gpi card (vitek systems, st.  louis, mo) and the rapstr system (innovative diagnostics, atlanta, ga) were compared with conventional biochemicals for the identification of viridans streptococci. one hundred nine clinical isolates were tested that included the following species: intermedius (38) sanguis ii (20), bovis (variant) (14), mitis  (14), salivarius (11), sanguis i (6), constellatus (3), mutans (2), and uberis (1). with initial testing, a correct species call was made with 72% of the isolates with the gpi card, 62% with the rapstr, and 50% with the api 20s. identifications of viridans streptococci group or those that needed additional biochemicals for species identification occurred with 28% of isolates with the api 20s, 8% with the rapstr, and 9% with the gpi card. incorrect identifications  occurred with 6% of the isolates tested by the gpi card, 20% with the api 20s, and 30% with the rapstr. most discrepancies with the rapstr were with 66% of the  intermedius isolates, whereas most, 55%, of misidentifications with the api 20s were with sanguis ii isolates. no identifications were made with 2% and 13% of isolates with the api 20s and gpi, respectively.

TI  == association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  == the prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. in this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. of 392 women with predominant lactobacillus morphotypes by gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) (p = 0.02). to determine whether any species were associated with bv, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the facklam scheme. the  most frequently isolated species from the vagina was streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by streptococcus acidominimus (6%), streptococcus constellatus (5%), streptococcus sanguis ii (4%), streptococcus mitis (2%), streptococcus salivarius (2%), streptococcus morbillorum (2%), streptococcus sanguis i (1%), streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. the distribution of the species among women with bv compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with bv: s. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, p less than 0.001) and s. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, p = 0.005). amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: s. sanguis ii (13 isolates), s. acidominimus (9 isolates), s. intermedius (10 isolates), s. constellatus (3 isolates), s. mitis (4 isolates), s. sanguis i (4 isolates), s. morbillorum (5 isolates), s. mutans (2 isolates), s. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive s. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. the distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.

TI  == cell surface hydrophobicity of group d and viridans streptococci isolated from patients with septicaemia.
AB  == sixty-three strains of group d streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and api strep. streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. constellatus (s.  milleri). one of the two isolates of s. faecium was a contamination. the reported increasing frequency of this organism and other group d and viridans streptococci as well as the association of s. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the  need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (sat) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains  isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. in the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. the surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.

TI  == evaluation of the api 20 strep system for species identification of "viridans" streptococci isolated from bacteremia.
AB  == species identifications of 71 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from blood and 4 reference strains were made by the api 20 strep system (api system s. a., montalieu-vercien, france) and the conventional method. there are high levels of agreement between results obtained with the both methods for determining acidification from carbohydrate except inulin. the api 20 strep system correctly  identified 74.7% of the viridans streptococci with 9.3% low descrimination, 12% incorrect and 4% unidentified. all strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, s. salivarius  and s. anginosus-constellatus were correctly identified. the correct identification rates for s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mg-intermedius were 88.9%, 68% and 61% respectively. the difference of inulin reaction and the taxonomy discrepancy may be the cause of different identification. the study indicates that the api 20 strep system has a good potentiality for species identification of viridans streptococci at present time, however, further refinement in needed.

TI  == fatty acid composition of streptococcus milleri.
AB  == the cellular fatty acids of 31 strains belonging to the streptococcus milleri group were analysed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. results were compared with findings from biochemical differentiation of the strains into streptococcus  constellatus (two strains), streptococcus anginosus (16 strains) and streptococcus intermedius (13 strains). eight strains of various other streptococci were included as internal references, including three strains of streptococcus morbillorum, three strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci, and two  strains of enterococci. the streptococcus milleri strains formed a very homogeneous group according to fatty acid composition and were easily differentiated from other groups. however, within the group, it was not possible  to differentiate streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus intermedius by fatty acid composition alone.

TI  == nutritionally variant streptococci from corneal ulcers in horses.
AB  == of 24 isolates of nutritionally variant streptococci recovered from equine corneal ulcers, 22 were tested for growth requirements, physiological and biochemical reactions, and susceptibility to different antimicrobial agents. satisfactory growth was obtained by supplementing blood agar and todd-hewitt broth with pyridoxal hydrochloride, and all of the media for the culture and the  biochemical testing were supplemented with 0.002% of this substance. biochemical  patterns of 12 of the isolates resembled those of two viridans streptococcal species, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus constellatus. patterns of 10 isolates did not resemble those of any recognized viridans species. all of the isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram of erythromycin per ml, less than or equal to 4 micrograms of chloramphenicol per ml, and less than or equal to 4 micrograms of gentamicin per ml, and all but two were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 microgram of penicillin per ml.

TI  == pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (agpc) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. the relationships among seven agpc strains, eight aerobes, and two bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. a total of 70 different combinations were tested. as judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or agpc were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35  combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. the agpc most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were peptococcus magnus, streptococcus constellatus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the agpc.

TI  == prevalence of viridans streptococci exhibiting lactose-inhibitable coaggregation  with oral actinomycetes.
AB  == fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. in a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii were determined. of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. the remaining 80 isolates were identified as streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mg-intermedius, or streptococcus morbillorum. of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. compared with previously  characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. the other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. it is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.
