TI  == sensitive detection of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by a polymicrobial proliferation of anaerobic bacteria and depletion of lactobacilli, which are components of natural vaginal microbiota. currently, there are limited conventional methods for bv diagnosis, and these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and rarely allow for  the detection of more than one agent simultaneously. therefore, we conceived and  validated a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-pcr) assay for the simultaneous screening of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents (bv-aas) related to symptomatic bv: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, atopobium vaginae, ureaplasma urealyticum, megasphaera type i, clostridia-like bacteria vaginosis-associated bacteria (bvabs) 1, 2, and 3, sneathia sanguinegens, and mycoplasma genitalium. the overall validation parameters of m-pcr compared to single pcr (spcr) were extremely high, including agreement of 99.1% and sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 100.0%, negative predictive value of 97.0%, accuracy of 99.3%, and agreement with nugent results of 100.0%. the prevalence of bv-aas was very high (72.6%), and simultaneous agents were detected in 53.0%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the m-pcr assay. therefore, the m-pcr assay has great potential to impact bv diagnostic methods in vaginal samples and  diminish associated complications in the near future.

TI  == clinical chorioamnionitis at term i: microbiology of the amniotic cavity using cultivation and molecular techniques.
AB  == introduction: the objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the amniotic fluid (af) microbiology of patients with the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis at term using both cultivation and molecular techniques; and 2)  to examine the relationship between intra-amniotic inflammation with and without  microorganisms and placental lesions consistent with acute af infection. methods: the af samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 46 women with clinical signs of chorioamnionitis at term were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anerobic bacteria as well as genital mycoplasmas) and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (pcr) coupled with electrospray ionization  mass spectrometry (pcr/esi-ms). the frequency of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (miac), intra-amniotic inflammation [defined as an af interleukin 6 (il-6) concentration >/=2.6 ng/ml], and placental lesions consistent with acute af infection (acute histologic chorioamnionitis and/or acute funisitis) were examined according to the results of af cultivation and pcr/esi-ms as well as af  il-6 concentrations. results: 1) culture identified bacteria in af from 46% (21/46) of the participants, whereas pcr/esi-ms was positive for microorganisms in 59% (27/46) - combining these two tests, microorganisms were detected in 61% (28/46) of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term. eight patients had discordant test results; one had a positive culture and negative pcr/esi-ms result, whereas seven patients had positive pcr/esi-ms results and negative cultures. 2) ureaplasma urealyticum (n=8) and gardnerella vaginalis (n=10) were the microorganisms most frequently identified by cultivation and pcr/esi-ms, respectively. 3) when combining the results of af culture, pcr/esi-ms and af il-6 concentrations, 15% (7/46) of patients did not have intra-amniotic inflammation or infection, 6.5% (3/46) had only miac, 54% (25/46) had microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation, and 24% (11/46) had intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable microorganisms. 4) placental lesions consistent with acute af  infection were significantly more frequent in patients with microbial-associated  intra-amniotic inflammation than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation [70.8% (17/24) vs. 28.6% (2/7); p=0.04]. conclusion: microorganisms in the af were identified in 61% of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term; 54% had microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation, whereas 24% had intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable microorganisms.

TI  == performance evaluation of a dna chip assay in the identification of major genitourinary pathogens.
AB  == background: to prevent the recurrence of genitourinary infections and to reduce the risks of their complications, accurate and rapid diagnosis are required. stdetect(r) chip is a dna chip which allows for the simultaneous detection of 13  major genitourinary pathogens in a single vaginal swab or urine specimen. we evaluated the analytical performance of the stdetect(r) chip for detecting target pathogens that commonly cause genitourinary infections. methods: the target pathogens of the stdetect(r) chip are chlamydia trachomatis, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma genitalium, ureaplasma urealyticum, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, trichomonas vaginalis, and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. performance of the stdetect(r) chip for the detection of target pathogens was evaluated comparing with the result of direct sequencing and conventional multiplex pcr assay. and precision tests for stdetect(r) chip were performed with quality control materials. results: the stdetect(r) chip showed high sensitivities (95.1%-100%), specificities (93.4% to 100%), concordance rates (95.0%-100%), positive predictive values (69.8%-100%), and negative predictive values (93.1%-100%) in its identification of 13 target pathogens. the stdetect(r) chip had a particularly excellent concordance rate (96.5%) for the 4 major pathogens, c. albicans, g. vaginalis, m. hominis, and u. urealyticum, compared with direct sequencing. comparing to multiplex pcr assay, stdetect(r) chip showed better sensitivity for detecting m. hominis (97.0% vs. 54.5%) and u. urealyticum  (93.2% vs. 65.9%). in precision tests, coefficients of variations for signal intensities were ranged from 11.2% to 26.2%. conclusion: the stdetect(r) chip showed excellent analytical performance, and its result was in good agreement with that obtained by direct sequencing.

TI  == characterization of the vaginal microbiota of healthy canadian women through the  menstrual cycle.
AB  == background: the vaginal microbial community plays a vital role in maintaining women's health. understanding the precise bacterial composition is challenging because of the diverse and difficult-to-culture nature of many bacterial constituents, necessitating culture-independent methodology. during a natural menstrual cycle, physiological changes could have an impact on bacterial growth,  colonization, and community structure. the objective of this study was to assess  the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and analyzed. samples were also assayed for total 16s rrna gene content and gardnerella vaginalis by quantitative pcr and screened  for the presence of mollicutes by using family and genus-specific pcr. results: overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. interestingly, two additional clusters were dominated by either bifidobacterium breve or a heterogeneous mixture of nonlactobacilli. direct g. vaginalis quantification correlated strongly with its pyrosequencing-read abundance, and mollicutes, including mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma parvum, and ureaplasma urealyticum, were detected in most samples. conclusions: our cpn60-based investigation of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated that in healthy women most vaginal microbiomes remained stable through their menstrual cycle. of interest in these findings was the presence of bifidobacteriales beyond just gardnerella species. bifidobacteriales are frequently underrepresented in 16s rrna gene-based studies, and their detection by cpn60-based investigation suggests that their significance in the vaginal community may be underappreciated.

TI  == human papillomavirus and other genital infections in indigenous women from paraguay: a cross-sectional analytical study.
AB  == background: the incidence of cervical cancer in paraguay is among the highest in  the world, with the human papillomavirus (hpv) being a necessary factor for cervical cancer. knowledge about hpv infection among indigenous women is limited. this cross-sectional study analyzed the frequency of hpv and other genital infections in indigenous paraguayan women of the department of presidente hayes.  methods: this study included 181 sexually active women without cervical lesions.  they belonged to the following ethnicities: maka (n = 40); nivacle (n = 23); sanapana (n = 33); enxet sur (n = 51) and toba-qom (n = 34). the detection of hpv and other gynecological infectious microorganisms was performed by either molecular methods (for mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis), gram staining and/or culture (for gardnerella vaginalis, candida sp, trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae), serological methods (for treponema pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus [hiv]) or cytology (cervical inflammation). results: a high prevalence (41.4%) of women positive for at least  one sexually transmitted infection (sti) was found (23.2% any-type hpv, 11.6% t pallidum, 10.5% t vaginalis, 9.9% c trachomatis and 0.6% hiv) with 12.2% having more than one sti. hpv infection was the most frequent, with 16.1% of women positive for high-risk hpv types. there was a statistically significant association observed between any-type hpv and c trachomatis (p = 0.004), which indicates that the detection of one of these agents should suggest the presence of the other. there was no association between any-type hpv and other genital infections or cervical inflammation, suggesting that other mechanism could exist  to favor infection with the virus. conclusion: this multidisciplinary work suggests that stis are frequent, making it necessary to implement control measures and improve diagnosis in order to increase the number of cases detected, especially in populations with poor access to health centers.

TI  == microbial and vaginal determinants influencing mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma  urealyticum genital colonization in a population of female patients.
AB  == mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum are associated with chorioamnionitis, preterm delivery and pelvic inflammatory disease. the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible risk factors of co-colonization by m. hominis in patients already colonized by u. urealyticum and compare demographic parameters, vaginal ph and microbiota of women colonized by u. urealyticum or m.  hominis. a total of 452 patients positive for u. urealyticum or m. hominis were analysed, 421 (93.1%) of whom were positive for u. urealyticum and 31 (6.9%) for  m. hominis. patients positive for m. hominis compared to patients positive for u. urealyticum were more frequently colonized by gardnerella vaginalis (71% vs 18.5%; p 0.0001), less frequently by lactobacilli (16.1% vs 61.5%; p 0.0001), and more frequently had a ph value higher than 4.5 (96.8% vs 57%; p 0.0001), all conditions associated to bacterial vaginosis (bv). logistic regression analysis showed that only g. vaginalis colonization and ph higher than 4.5 were independently related to m. hominis colonization (respectively p 0.0001 and p 0.016). thus, in women colonized by u. urealyticum, bv is an independent risk factor for m. hominis co-colonization.

TI  == plants traditionally used individually and in combination to treat sexually transmitted infections in northern maputaland, south africa: antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: although medicinal plants are used extensively to treat sexually transmitted infections (stis) in rural northern maputaland, kwazulu-natal, the efficacy and safety of these plants have not previously been evaluated. aim of study: a study was designed to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity profiles of a selection (individual plants and selected combinations) of traditionally used plants in this study area. materials and methods: aqueous and organic (dichloromethane: methanol, 1:1) extracts were prepared. antimicrobial activity was assessed using the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay against the sti associated pathogens; candida albicans atcc 10231, ureaplasma urealyticum clinical strain, oligella ureolytica atcc 43534, trichomonas vaginalis clinical strain, gardnerella vaginalis atcc 14018 and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 19424. for the combination study, interactions were assessed using the fractional inhibitory concentration (sigmafic). the plant species were assessed for safety using the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide (mtt) cellular  viability assay on the human embryonic kidney epithelial (graham, hek-293) cell line. results: for the antimicrobial studies, u. urealyticum was the most sensitive of the six test organisms, with the aqueous extract of ranunculus multifidus (0.02mg/ml) and the organic extract of peltophorum africanum (0.04mg/ml) being the most antimicrobially active plant species studied. sclerocarya birrea was found to have the broadest spectrum of activity (mean mic  of 0.89mg/ml). the only plant species to exhibit some degree of cytotoxicity against the kidney epithelial cell line was kigelia africana (100microg/ml), with 22% and 16% cell death for the aqueous and organic extracts, respectively. of the 13 combinations studied, several synergistic combinations were evident, the most  prominent being the combination of albizia adianthifolia and trichilia dregeana (aqueous extract) with an sigmafic value of 0.15 against o. ureolytica. synergistic interactions were observed regardless of the ratio of the aqueous mixtures of the two plants. syzygium cordatum and s. birrea (aqueous extract) was also a combination of interest, demonstrating synergistic (sigmafic=0.42) interactions against o. ureolytica. this combination, however, also displayed some cytotoxicity towards the human epithelial cell line. conclusion: this study  demonstrated that anecdotal evidence of plant use does not always correlate with  in vitro activity. furthermore, the toxicological profiling is of utmost importance as if not combined in its correct ratio can lead to potential adverse  effects.

TI  == bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern poland.
AB  == objectives: the objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of  an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. material and methods: the study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already  given birth to healthy children. the material for the presence of c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, m. genitalium, m. hominis and u. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by pcr. furthermore, bd probetec et system was used to detect c. trachomatis infection. vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. results: u. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of  controls. presence of m. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and c.  trachomatis only in latter (3%). n. gonorrhoeae and m. genitalium were not found  in any of the examined women. the frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. there were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). conclusions: despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. bv develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.

TI  == fetal membrane biomarker network diversity and disease functions induced by intra-amniotic pathogens.
AB  == problem: intra-amniotic pathogens and by-products activate innate immune responses encompassing multitudes of signaling molecules and pathways that can result in spontaneous preterm birth (ptb). this study investigates fetal membrane response to bacterial stimulation using a bioinformatics approach. method of study: dysregulated biomarker (il1-beta, il-2, il-8, il-10, and tnf-alpha) data from fetal membranes at term stimulated with ureaplasma urealyticum, ureaplasma parvum, mycoplasma hominis, e. coli, group b streptococci, polyporhans gingivalis, or gardnerella vaginalis with 50% (v/v) amniotic fluid (af) were analyzed by ingenuity pathway analysis. results: in racially stratified analysis, networks representing late-stage immune inflammation were seen in african-americans in af absence. inflammation was dominant in af presence as well. in caucasians, late-stage immune response was dominant with af, but not in  its absence. conclusions: fetal membrane biofunctions in response to bacteria reflect early- and late-stage innate immune defenses that vary based on the presence of af and subject race.

TI  == simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  == our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex pcr-based  reverse line blot assay. we have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. in this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. the 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. in a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the  14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.

TI  == amniotic fluid and maternal race influence responsiveness of fetal membranes to bacteria.
AB  == spontaneous preterm birth (ptb) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pprom) occur more frequently in african-american women than in other racial groups. this may be due to an enhanced inflammatory response to pathogens associated with the  condition. it is also possible that amniotic fluid (af) has different immunomodulatory properties in african-american women that increase their risk of ptb and pprom. to test this, we cultured fetal membranes from european-american and african-american women with sterile medium (control), escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococci (gbs), polyporphorans gingivalis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum or ureaplasma parvum in the presence and absence of 50% autologous af. cytokine concentrations were quantified in the  conditioned medium. all bacterial species increased il-8 production. il-1beta and tnf-alpha production were stimulated by lps, e. coli, and g. vaginalis compared with control, but responses to group b streptococci and p. gingivalis were limited to il-1beta and tnf-alpha respectively. genital mycoplasmas stimulated tnf-alpha and il-10 but had no effect on il-1beta production. african-americans had twice the il-1beta response to e. coli as european-americans (p=0.031). conversely, european-americans produced more il-8 in response to lps than african-americans (p=0.026). af had both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties that varied between races and pathogens. these results suggest that the host response to fetal membrane infections is complex and not generalizable. interventions to prevent ptb and pprom may need to be customized based on a patient's race, type of bacterial infection and factors in her af.

TI  == bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane toll-like receptor expression.
AB  == problem: preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pprom) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (ptb) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection  and inflammation. the membranes may sense and respond to microbes via toll-like receptors (tlrs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation  in this tissue. the objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of tlrs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and ptb. method of study: normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. after 24 hrs, rna was extracted and quantitative rt-pcr performed for tlrs1-10. results: treatment of fetal membranes with mycoplasma hominis increased expression of tlr4, tlr6, and tlr8 mrna. ureaplasma parvum upregulated tlr8 mrna, and porphyromonas gingivalis  significantly increased fetal membrane tlr7 expression. in contrast, treatment with gram-negative escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated tlr10 mrna. no effect was detected for ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, or group b streptococcus. conclusion: these findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane tlr expression patterns. moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pprom and ptb, arise.

TI  == preserved ex vivo inflammatory status in decidual cells from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection.
AB  == objective: to compare the inflammatory response preserved ex vivo by decidual cells isolated from women who experienced preterm labor with and without subclinical intrauterine infection. methods: fetal membranes were obtained after  cesarean section from 35 women who delivered before 37 weeks of gestation following spontaneous preterm labor, with no clinical evidence of intrauterine infection. decidua was microbiologically tested and cultured. concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-2, il-4, il-10), pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-6, il-8, il-1beta and tnf-alpha), and matrix metalloproteinases (mmp-1, mmp-2, mmp-3, mmp-7, mmp-8, mmp-9) were measured in the supernatants using bio-plex, and prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) was measured by enzyme immunoassay. results: subclinical infection was confirmed in 10 women (28.5%). microorganisms  isolated were ureaplasma urealyticum (4), group b streptococci (3), gardnerella vaginalis (1), and escherichia coli (2). we found a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a significant decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokines in supernatants from decidual cells obtained from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection compared to women without infection. secretion of mmp-1, mmp-8, mmp-9 and pge(2) was significantly higher in infected  women. secretion of il-8 by decidual cells from infected women persisted upon repeated in vitro culture passages. conclusions: almost 30% of idiopathic preterm labor cases were associated with subclinical intrauterine infection, and decidual cells isolated from these cases preserved an ex vivo inflammatory status after in vivo bacterial exposure.

TI  == [possible role of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis in the etiology of infectious vaginitis].
AB  == vaginitis is a common gynecologic disorder. it is due to several causes, some even unknown. bacteroides fragilis is the most important anaerobe in clinical bacteriology, some strains of this group are notable for being enterotoxigenic and they have been associated with intestinal and extraintestinal syndromes. they have recently been isolated from patients with vaginitis. the purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis with infectious vaginitis. 265 samples of vaginal exudate were processed, 202 from symptomatic patients and 63 healthy women. the identification of the microorganisms was carried out by conventional methods. in 31.2% of symptomatic patients were identified: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus, candida albicans, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and streptococcus agalactiae. b. fragilis was identified in 27 symptomatic patients and 5 healthy women. these strains were cultivated in liquid medium and incubated during 48 h at 36 degrees  c in anaerobe chambers. supernatant activity was assayed in ht-29 cells. eighteen b. fragilis strains isolated from symptomatic patients were enterotoxigenic, because induced alterations in target cell morphology. it was not identified in healthy women (p < 0.05). 77.7% of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis strains were not associated with other specific pathogens. this fact suggests that enterotoxigenic b. fragilis could be a cause for vaginitis. the effect of enterotoxin on e-cadherin of vaginal epithelium could facilitate invasion and its possible pathogenic role in the vagina. this is the first report that associates enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis as a possible cause of infectious vaginitis.

TI  == hiv-infected women of burkina faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 hiv-positive  compared to 200 hiv-negative women at the maternal and child health (mch) service of saint camille medical center ouagadougou (burkina faso). methodology: after revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. results: among hiv-positive and hiv-negative women, we identified respectively: mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus  5.5%); ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection m. hominis with u. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); e. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. the nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of bv,  was significantly higher in hiv-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). enterobacter, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella oxitocica, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, trichomonas vaginalis, and gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence  ranging from 0% to 5%. conclusion: these results demonstrate that the hiv-positive women of burkina faso are frequently affected by bv and represent a  reservoir for mycoplasma infection. since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.

TI  == the prevalence of urogenital micro-organisms detected by a multiplex pcr-reverse  line blot assay in women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia.
AB  == this study used a previously described multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma parvum, ureaplasma urealyticum, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. first-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. one hundred and  sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly g. vaginalis and ureaplasma spp. the prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. only g. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (p = 0.05). the specificity of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. the mean sensitivities of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms  were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. there were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, t. vaginalis and h. influenzae, although all  were found infrequently. overall, the mpcr/rlb platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.

TI  == subtle perturbations of genital microflora alter mucosal immunity among low-risk  pregnant women.
AB  == objective: alteration in the vaginal flora has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. the objective of this study was to examine the impact of changes in individual microflora on genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women in early pregnancy. design: cross-sectional study. setting: large, tertiary care, academic hospital clinic. population: low-risk women were enrolled prior to 14 weeks' gestation. methods: women were included if they had no medical or previous obstetrical complications, were non-smokers, had no sexually transmitted infections and no intercourse in the last 48 hours. consenting women underwent speculum examination for collection of vaginal culture and dacron swabs for cytokine analysis. semi-quantitative vaginal cultures were performed in a reference laboratory. main outcome measures: concentrations of immune mediators were compared in the presence of various organisms. concentrations were converted to multiples of the median to standardize the values of each mediator. regression analyses were performed to control for race. results: we enrolled 47 women. the frequencies of genital microorganisms were: h(2)o(2) -producing lactobacilli (70%), ureaplasma urealyticum (66%), gardnerella vaginalis (45%), anaerobic non-pigmented gram-negative rods (anpgnr, 40%), anaerobic pigmented gram-negative rods (apgnr, 17%). after adjusting for race and body mass index, interleukin-1beta, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte  macrophage-colony stimulating factor were increased in the presence of g. vaginalis, anpgnr, and apgnr. there was no consistent impact on the other markers of immune activation. conclusion: the presence of individual species impacts genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women. perturbations in genital immunity could partially explain heterogeneity in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == prevalence of genital mycoplasma, ureaplasma, gardnerella, and human papillomavirus in japanese men with urethritis, and risk factors for detection of urethral human papillomavirus infection.
AB  == to analyze the risk factors for hpv infection in the urethra, we examined the prevalence of various microorganisms, for example neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, ureaplasma parvum, gardnerella vaginalis, and human papillomavirus (hpv) in japanese male patients with urethritis, and investigated their sexual backgrounds. rubbed samples obtained from the distal urethra and questionnaires regarding sexual activity and demographic information were collected from 176 participants. n. gonorrhoeae, c. trachomatis, m. genitalium, m. hominis, u. urealyticum, u. parvum, g. vaginalis, and hpv were detected in 19, 26, 18, 12, 12, 8.5, 14, and 20%, respectively, of all cases in this study. multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that more than 4 sexual partners within the last year and presence of n. gonorrhoeae and/or c. trachomatis and/or m. genitalium infections were independent risk factors for urethral hpv infection, with odds ratios of 3.85 (95% ci 1.49-9.94) and 2.41 (95% ci 1.03-5.61), respectively. it is likely that urethral hpv detection is associated with current sexual activity and the presence of n. gonorrhoeae, c. trachomatis, and/or m. genitalium infections.

TI  == bacterial species present in the lower male genital tract: a five-year retrospective study.
AB  == objectives: to identify bacterial species present in the lower genital tract of males and to investigate the relationship with semen quality. methods: the microscopic analyses and cultures of 696 semen specimens, collected over five years from males investigated for subfertility, were retrospectively assessed. results: semen cultures were sterile in 48%; they showed a polymicrobial flora (more than two bacterial species) in 30%, and were positive (>1 x 10(3) colony forming units/ml) in 22% of the cases. gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequently isolated bacterium, followed by escherichia coli and enterococcus sp.  ureaplasma urealyticum was recovered from 13 of 147 samples (9%). of patients with bacteriospermia 42% had leukospermia (>10(6) leukocytes/ml of semen). bacteriospermia and leukospermia did not correlate with each other although a positive correlation was found between the presence of leukocytes and g. vaginalis isolation. semen parameters were correlated with the bacterial species  isolated most frequently. in comparison with controls, sperm concentration, motility and morphology were mostly deteriorated in the presence of g. vaginalis  and u. urealyticum. conclusions: positive seminal fluid cultures must be interpreted with caution, taking into account both raised colony counts of single isolates and leukocyte concentration in the semen. thus the common misdiagnosis of genital tract infection, based on the presence of seminal bacteria, and unnecessary treatment with antibiotics may be avoided.

TI  == detection of sexually transmitted infection and human papillomavirus in negative  cytology by multiplex-pcr.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (hpv) and 15 species that cause sexually transmitted infections (stis) in negative cytology. in addition, we compared the diagnostic performance  of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with widely available techniques used to detect hpv. methods: we recruited 235 women of reproductive age who had negative cytology findings in a liquid-based cervical smear. stis were identified by multiplex pcr, and hpv genotypes by multiplex pcr, hybrid capture 2, and dna microaray; discordant results were analyzed by direct sequencing. results: approximately 96.6% of patients with negative cytology results were positive for  pathogens that cause stis. the pathogens most frequently detected were gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum. the incidence of hpv in negative cytology was 23.3%. low-risk hpv infection was significantly correlated with chalmaydia trachomatis, and high-risk hpv infection was significantly correlated  with group beta streptococcus. the analytical sensitivities of the multiplex pcr  and dna microarray were higher than 80%, and the analytical specificity was nearly 100% for all tests. conclusions: multiplex pcr yielded results that most of patients with negative cytology were positive for pathogens that cause stis, and were more similar to that of dna microarray, than that of hybrid capture 2 in terms of analytical sensitivity and prediction value of hpv infection.

TI  == an antimicrobial investigation of plants used traditionally in southern africa to treat sexually transmitted infections.
AB  == aim of the study: eighteen plants were assessed for antimicrobial activity against pathogens associated with prevalent urogenital/sexually transmitted infections. plant selection was based on information obtained from the ethnobotanical literature. materials and methods: dried plant material was submerged in a 1:1 mixture of methanol and dichloromethane for 24 h. aqueous extracts were prepared by submerging dried plant material in sterile distilled water for 24 h followed by lyophilization. essential oils were distilled from the two aromatic plant species (tarchonanthus camphoratus and croton gratissimus). antimicrobial activity was assessed using the micro-well minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay with specific modifications to facilitate fastidious growth of pathogens. results: tarchonanthus camphoratus (solvent extract) showed  the most significant broad spectrum activity with mic values ranging between 0.50 and 0.70 mg/ml against five of the six pathogens tested. other noteworthy activity was found for hypericum aethiopicum (root) at 0.3 mg/ml (neisseria gonorrhoeae).polygala fruticosa and the solvent root extract of hypericum aethiopicum showed highest sensitivities towards gardnerella vaginalis at 0.2 mg/ml. efficacy of the solvent extracts against the pathogen oligella ureolytica  demonstrated antimicrobial activity (mic values <or=1.0 mg/ml) for seven plant species. the highest activity noted against ureaplasma urealyticum was for psidium guajava (solvent extract) at 0.8 mg/ml. in general the aqueous extracts displayed mostly poor anti-sti activity. the most noteworthy susceptibility for the aqueous extracts was noted with the plant extract syzygium cordatum (mic value 0.1 mg/ml against candida albicans). the most noteworthy activity for the essential oils was observed for tarchonanthus camphoratus (0.8 mg/ml) against oligella ureolytica. conclusions: antimicrobial activity was observed for a number of the plant samples against at least one or more pathogen, thus validating the ethnobotanical use as an anti-infective to treat sexually transmitted diseases.

TI  == gardnerella, trichomonas vaginalis, candida, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum in the genital discharge of symptomatic fertile and asymptomatic infertile women.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the different prevalence of the microorganisms investigated in the two groups considered: fertile women with symptoms and asymptomatic women with infertility problems. the data from women (n= 952) investigated for two years for quality of genital discharge and the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida species, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyiticum and chlamydia trachomatis were retrospectively analyzed. in the population of fertile women with symptoms the microrganisms most frequently involved are gardnerella vaginalis (26.6%), candida species (12.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (9.2%). the genital discharges of asymptomatic women with infertility problems are characterized by a prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis (19.7%), enterobacteriaceae or enterococci (12.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (8.6%). the reduction of vaginal lactobacilli flora and the presence of an elevated number of polymorphonucleates  in the vaginal discharge are important parameters to consider for the evaluation  of the health status of the human female urogenital tract. our results indicate that is important to culture the vaginal discharge for streptococcus agalactiae and for prevalence of enterobacteriaceae and enterococci. lastly, the reasons for the prevalence of some microorganisms (gardnerella vaginalis, enterobacteriaceae  and enterococci, streptococcus agalactiae) in the population of infertile asymptomatic women need to be better analyzed especially after the recent studies correlating idiopathic infertility with the presence of cervical cytokines in women with an abnormal vaginal flora.

TI  == [vaginal ectopia of urethra as a cause of chronic recurrent cystitis in women: diagnosis and treatment].
AB  == ectopia of the urethral opening (female hypospadia) often causes chronic recurrent cystitis in women because of a retrograde delivery of urogenital infection from the introitus and vagina to the short wide urethra and urinary bladder. etiologically, cystitis develops due to pathogenic vaginal microflora: chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, ureaplasma, urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, candida, e. coli and other gram-negative bacteria. in 64 female patients aged 16-57 years with female hypospadia (fh) the diagnosis was made by o'donnel-hirchhorn symptom. identification of urinary and vaginal microflora was made using polymerase chain reaction. radical treatment of chronic recurrent cystitis in fh is surgical transposition of the distal urethra and its  opening in the typical place with pre- and perioperative anti-inflammatory therapy according to the pathogen or with drugs having combined antimycotic and antiprotosoic properties. one of such drugs safocid demonstrates a rapid therapeutic effect in mixed urogenital infections causing chronic recurrent cystitis in women.

TI  == simultaneous identification of 14 genital microorganisms in urine by use of a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assay.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv1) and hsv2, n. meningitidis, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. the limits of detection for the mpcr/rlb assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic dna. there were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. this method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with  and without urethritis attending two sydney sexual health clinics. one or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mpcr/rlb and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific pcr), 9 were positive only by mpcr/rlb, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. the mpcr/rlb method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.

TI  == does progesterone inhibit bacteria-stimulated interleukin-8 production by lower genital tract epithelial cells?
AB  == objective: progesterone (p(4)) has been clinically shown to prevent the recurrence of preterm birth. the mechanism(s) of action is unclear, but may involve modulation of the immunologic inflammatory response of the lower genital  tract. we evaluated the effects of p(4) on interleukin-8 (il-8) production by vaginal and cervical epithelial cells stimulated with bacterial species that are  commonly associated with preterm birth. methods: vaginal and endocervical epithelial cells were incubated with up to 10,000 ng/ml p(4) overnight and stimulated with heat-killed escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, or ureaplasma urealyticum. concentrations of il-8 in conditioned medium were quantified by elisa and viability of the cell cultures was measured by the reduction of a tetrazolium salt. results: e. coli, g. vaginalis and u. urealyticum-stimulated il-8 production for both cell lines. p(4) inhibited basal  and bacteria-stimulated il-8 production for vaginal epithelial cells but enhanced il-8 production by endocervical cells. p(4) reduced the number of viable cells for both cell lines. conclusions: p(4) inhibits il-8 production by vaginal epithelial cells stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth, possibly by reducing the number of viable cells or by inhibiting their proliferation. although p(4) also reduces proliferation of endocervical cells it  also increases their production of il-8.

TI  == molecular quantification of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. methods: molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by gram stain-based nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for bv; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. a quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 bv-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. the targeted microorganisms were gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus species, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, and candida albicans (which can be identified by gram staining), as well as atopobium vaginae, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by gram staining). results: with use of the nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as bv, and 44 were classified as intermediate. except for u. urealyticum, m. mulieris, and lactobacillus species,  dna of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating  bv, but the predictive value of such detection was low. the molecular quantification of a. vaginae (dna level, > or = 10(8) copies/ml) and g. vaginalis (dna level, > or = 10(9) copies/ml) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of bv, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a bv profile. when applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. conclusions: we report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of bv.

TI  == preterm birth due to maternal infection: causative pathogens and modes of prevention.
AB  == preterm birth represents a major problem for modern obstetrics due to its increasing frequency and the accompanying socioeconomic impact. although several  maternal characteristics related to preterm birth have been identified, the etiology in most cases remains inadequately understood. various microorganisms have been linked to the pathogenesis of preterm birth. microbes may reach the amniotic cavity and fetus by ascending from the vagina and cervix, by hematogenous distribution through the placenta, by migration from the abdominal cavity through the fallopian tubes, or through invasive medical procedures. organisms commonly cultured from the amniotic cavity following preterm delivery include ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, bacteroides spp., gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, and group b hemolytic streptococci. several trials have examined the effect of antibiotic administration to patients with preterm labor and intact membranes, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, genital mycoplasmal infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and bacterial vaginosis. the results of such studies, which were variable and often conflicting, are discussed here.

TI  == a cluster analysis of bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora and pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == controversy surrounds the association between bacterial vaginosis (bv) and pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). women (n = 1,140) were ascertained at five us centers, enrolled (1999-2001), and followed up for a median of 3 years. serial vaginal swabs were obtained for gram's stain and cultures. pid was defined as 1)  histologic endometritis or 2) pelvic pain and tenderness plus oral temperature >38.8 degrees c, leukorrhea or mucopus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >15 mm/hour, white blood cell count >10,000, or gonococcal/chlamydial lower genital infection. exploratory factor analysis identified two discrete clusters of genital microorganisms. the first correlated with bv by gram's stain and consisted of the absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and, to  a lesser degree, ureaplasma urealyticum. the second, unrelated to bv by gram's stain, consisted of enterococcus species and escherichia coli. being in the highest tertile in terms of growth of bv-associated microorganisms increased pid  risk (adjusted rate ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 3.53). carriage  of non-bv-associated microorganisms did not increase pid risk. women with heavy growth of bv-associated microorganisms and a new sexual partner appeared to be at particularly high risk (adjusted rate ratio = 8.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 69.2). when identified by microbial culture, a combination of bv-related microorganisms significantly elevated the risk of acquiring pid.

TI  == symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis in heterosexual men: a case control study.
AB  == objective: to determine microbial and behavioural factors contributing to non-gonococcal urethral symptoms in men. methods: case-control study of heterosexual men with non-gonococcal urethral symptoms (cases) and without urethral symptoms (controls) attending melbourne sexual health centre, australia. sexual behaviour and condom use were measured by questionnaire. first stream urine was tested for potential pathogens: chlamydia trachomatis (ligase chain reaction), mycoplasma genitalium (polymerase chain reaction, pcr), ureaplasma urealyticum (culture and pcr), and streptococcus spp, gardnerella vaginalis, and  haemophilus species (culture). urethral smears from cases were examined for polymorphonuclear leucocytes. results: 80 cases and 79 controls were recruited over 4 months in 2002-3. 49 cases (61%) had urethritis by microscopic criteria, 17 (21%) had chlamydia trachomatis (adjusted odds ratio (or) 27 (95% confidence interval (ci): 3.4 to 222)), five (6%) had mycoplasma genitalium (or 6.1 (95% ci: 0.6 to 61)), and 11 (14%) had gardnerella vaginalis (or 9.0 (95% ci: 1.6 to 52)). other organisms were not significantly associated with urethral symptoms. the presence of urethritis on urethral smear did not predict the presence of chlamydia trachomatis (or 1.7 (95% ci: 0.5 to 5.4)). urethral symptoms were significantly associated with unprotected vaginal sex with more than one casual partner (or 9.3 (95% ci: 1.3 to 65)) and unprotected anal sex with a regular partner in the past month (or 3.5 (95% ci: 1.0 to 13)). conclusion: gardnerella vaginalis and unprotected anal sex may cause symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis. microscopy of the urethral smear to diagnose urethritis in this population does not help to identify which men with urethral symptoms require treatment for chlamydia.

TI  == characterization of vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis in women who have sex with women.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis a "broad overview".
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) was first reported in 1995 by gardner and dukes, who described the unique clinical signs and symptoms and the distinctive nature of the vaginal discharge associated with it. they also described a "new" causative organism, which they named "haemophilus vaginalis", subsequently renamed gardnerella vaginalis. bv is currently the most prevalent cause of infectious vaginitis among women attending for genitourinary diseases. bv has a complex microbiology. lactobacillus populations, which are usually dominant in healthy women, are replaced by a polymicrobial group of organisms that includes g. vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods such as prevotella species, peptostreptococcus species, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and often mobiluncus species. anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the  syndrome, raising the vaginal ph and producing a discharge odor. the excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in "clue cell". nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge if untreated. results from epidemiologic studies have associated bv with serious upper genital tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcome. in particular, the  presence of bv in pregnant women increases the risk of preterm delivery, and evidence is now compelling that bv is a cause of preterm delivery. the interest in potential invasiveness of g. vaginalis has increased. however, virulence determinants have not been studied enough. the most important therapy includes clindamycin and metronidazole.

TI  == preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  == opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (ptb) cases. bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic  species primarily among prevotella, porphyromonas, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, and mobiluncus; mycoplasma hominis; and ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. this bv complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, ptb, and other perinatal infectious complications. pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. in the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely f. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and f. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to ptb.

TI  == vaginal microflora in postmenopausal women who have not received estrogen replacement therapy.
AB  == we studied the vaginal microflora of 73 postmenopausal women who had never received estrogen replacement therapy. the median age of these women was 67 years, and none of them had bacterial vaginosis. lactobacilli were detected in 36 (49%) of these women at a mean concentration of 10(5.7) cfu/g of vaginal fluid. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 38% of the women. some of the other organisms that were recovered, including gardnerella vaginalis (27% of the  women), ureaplasma urealyticum (13%), candida albicans (1%), and prevotella bivia (33%), were less frequently isolated from postmenopausal women than from women of reproductive age, while coliforms (41%) were recovered at higher frequencies. lactobacilli, yeasts, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria are less commonly part of the vaginal microflora in postmenopausal women than in women of  reproductive age, which may explain the decrease in the incidence of bacterial vaginosis and yeast vaginitis among these women.

TI  == microbiology of semen specimens from males attending a fertility clinic.
AB  == the relationship between semen quality, pyospermia and bacteriology was studied in 201 semen specimens from male patients attending a fertility clinic. semen quality parameters were within normal limits in 115 (57%) patients, slightly reduced in 60 (30%), and 26 (13%) had findings indicating reduced fertility. twelve patients (6%) had pyospermia. in 182 patients, 552 microorganisms were detected, including enterobacteriaceae (2.8%), gardnerella vaginalis (9.6%), chlamydia trachomatis (1.6%), mycoplasma genitalium (0.9%), and ureaplasma urealyticum (11.8%). semen quality was neither related to occurrence of microorganisms nor pyospermia. however, pyospermia was associated with simultaneous growth of gardnerella vaginalis and ureaplasma urealyticum. the exact nature of this association could not be ascertained, in as far as the males were not questioned about urethritis symptoms.

TI  == what is normal vaginal flora?
AB  == objective: to observe the composition of the vaginal flora of healthy women over  time, and in relation to hormonal changes, sexual activity, and hygiene habits. design: a longitudinal surveillance of the vaginal flora over an eight week period. subjects: 26 female health care workers in local genitourinary medicine clinics. methods: the participants were anonymised. they filled in diary cards daily. blind vaginal swabs were self-taken two-seven times weekly. a smear was air-dried for later gram staining. the swabs were also cultured for candida spp,  gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum.  results: of 26 subjects, only four had normal vaginal microbiology throughout. one woman, who was not sexually active, had bacterial vaginosis (bv) throughout and nine (35%) had intermittent bv. candidiasis was found intermittently in eight women (31%), and eight had normal microscopy. u urealyticum was isolated intermittently in 40% of women with bv, 25% with candida, and 50% with normal microscopy. many women were symptomatic, but symptoms correlated poorly with microbiological findings. all but two women were sexually active; however, more women with bv were exposed to semen. bv seemed to be related to frequent use of scented soap, and there appeared to be an additive effect of clothing and hygiene factors. conclusions: our study raises doubts about what should be regarded as normal vaginal flora. it calls into question the significance of finding bv or u  urealyticum on a single occasion in asymptomatic women, or of finding normal flora in symptomatic women. the effect of external factors on the vaginal flora deserve further study.

AB  == a prospective study of the vaginal flora changes between midtrimester and labor was undertaken in 560 women; 337 had intact membranes and were in labor when swabs were taken. of these, 45 delivered preterm. gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum (both associated with preterm birth when present in midtrimester), and mycoplasma hominis commonly persisted between midtrimester and labor, particularly in the preterm cohort (24 [65%] of 37 midtrimester isolates), and these organisms were seldom acquired late in pregnancy. a second group, bacteroides species, had both a high persistence (9 [60%] of 15 midtrimester isolates) and high late acquisition rate (10 [53%] of 19 labor isolates) in the preterm cohort. these findings provide a rationale for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. a third group, comprising enteropharyngeal bacteria and peptostreptococcus species, were almost all acquired late in the preterm cohort (14 [88%] of 16 labor isolates), and persistence from midtrimester was rare.

TI  == genital flora in pregnancy and its association with intrauterine growth retardation.
AB  == a study of risk factors for intrauterine growth retardation (iugr) was conducted  among a cohort of 13,914 pregnant women enrolled in the multicenter vaginal infections and prematurity study. from 23 through 26 weeks of gestational age, cultures of specimens from the vagina and cervix were done for group b streptococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera  bacteroides, porphyromonas, and prevotella. newborns who were small for their gestational age were delivered by 1,251 women, and infants of the appropriate weight for their gestational age were delivered by 10,332 women. when controlling for ethnicity and smoking and excluding women treated with antibiotics, the mantel-haenszel adjusted relative risk of iugr was 1.16 for bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. (95% confidence interval [95% ci], 1.01 to 1.33), 1.16 for m. hominis (95% ci, 1.04 to 1.29), 1.20 for u. urealyticum (95% ci, 1.05 to 1.38), and 1.22 for t. vaginalis (95% ci, 1.05 to 1.42). there was also a strong and significant trend for an increasing risk of iugr with the number of these four microbes recovered. among women colonized with all four isolates, the adjusted odds ratio of iugr was 1.79 (95% ci, 1.27 to 2.52) in comparison with women not colonized with any of these microorganisms. group b streptococci, n. gonorrhoeae, c. trachomatis, and c. albicans were not significantly associated with iugr. these results suggest that infection is associated with some cases of iugr and that specific microorganisms, alone or in  combination, are involved. since genital isolates are highly correlated with each other, the relative contribution of each microbe is difficult to determine.

TI  == variability of polymerase chain reaction-based detection of human papillomavirus  dna is associated with the composition of vaginal microbial flora.
AB  == the results of repeated human papillomavirus (hpv) dna testing were compared to changes in cervical pathology and the composition of vaginal microorganisms. a cohort of 19 women with hpv cervical infections in the absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at enrollment was reexamined on average at 7.3-month intervals over a 2-year period. at each follow-up visit, cytological and colposcopic examinations were done and vaginal microorganisms were assessed quantitatively by gram staining of secretions, and anaerobic and aerobic culture. hpv genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 were detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis using dna isolated from exfoliated cervical cells. the detection of hpv  dna was significantly associated with carriage of grade ii flora (p < 0.001), isolation of gardnerella vaginalis (p = 0.03), ureaplasma urealyticum (p = 0.04), candida albicans (p = 0.01), bacteroides species (p = 0.01), and overgrowth by anaerobes (p = 0.004). normal vaginal flora, characterised by the predominance of lactobacillus species, was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with a negative hpv test. the detection of hpv dna is associated with the composition of microorganisms present in the vagina at the time of testing.

AB  == a group of microorganisms are present concurrently in high concentrations in the  vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis. the major members of the group are gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas and bacteroides, peptostreptococcus species, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and often mobiluncus species. facultative species of lactobacillus are present in lower concentrations and are less prevalent in bacterial vaginosis than in women with a normal vaginal examination. the exact microbe(s) responsible for bacterial vaginosis is unknown whether among the organisms listed above or an unknown agent. the high concentrations of anaerobic gram-negative rods, peptostreptococci, and other opportunistic pathogens in the lower genital tract place women with bacterial vaginosis at increased risk for genital infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.

AB  == lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. the role of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of h2o2-positive and h2o2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. compared with women with h2o2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized  by h2o2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and  viridans streptococci (p less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). in addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with h2o2-positive lactobacilli to have chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (p less than .05 for each comparison). vaginal colonization by group b streptococci or escherichia coli was not related to the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli. these data suggest that the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic features of urethritis in men in toulouse, france.
AB  == on hundred twenty-six men who attended a hospital microbiology laboratory and 99  men who attended a private laboratory in toulouse, france, for symptoms of urethritis were examined during 1988, for evidence of urethral pathogens. the following incidences were found: neisseria gonorrhoeae: 24 (10.7%); chlamydia trachomatis: 58 (25.8%); ureaplasma urealyticum: 46 (20.4%); gardnerella vaginalis: 21 (9.3%); haemophilus parainfluenzae: 21 (9.3%); streptococcus agalactiae: 15 (6.7%); candida albicans: 10 (4.4%); and trichomonas vaginalis: 4  (1.8%). the prevalence of these microorganisms was similar in the two groups of patients. no pathogen was isolated from 71 patients (31.6%). mixed infections with at least two pathogens were found in 49 men (21.8%). another goal of this study was to determine the relative prevalence of urethral pathogens in relation  to clinical findings. n. gonorrhoeae was isolated significantly more often in patients who had a urethral discharge (p less than .05) that contained five or more polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (pmn/hpf) (p less than .001). g. vaginalis was isolated significantly more often in patients who did not have an urethral discharge (p less than .05) and in men with less than five pmn/hpf (p less than .05). isolation of c. albicans was significantly associated with pruritus (p less than .05) and balanitis (p less than .001). like the clinical features, the gram-stained urethral smear was of limited value in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making regarding non-gonococcal urethritis. in contrast, this study underlines the importance of full identification of urethral isolates  in the management of urethritis in men.

TI  == prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was  obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta  consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

TI  == survival of gardnerella vaginalis in human urine.
AB  == the authors studied the survival of gardnerella vaginalis in human urine and determined conditions for optimum recovery on agar media. gardnerella counts declined by greater than 99.9% in urine held at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, whereas the falloff was negligible at 4 degrees c. viability was lost after 6 hours in urine with ph of 5, and only 0.01% cells survived in urine with ph of 7. in contrast, greater than 90% cells survived exposure at ph of 6. dialysis to remove small molecular weight (less than 14,000) inhibitors did not enhance survival. co-cultivation with ureaplasma urealyticum and the addition of glycogen improved survival. maximum recovery from urine required anaerobic incubation on enriched agar medium (ph 6.5-7.5) for at least 48 hours. gardnerella vaginalis survives poorly in human urine at 37 degrees c. culture for these bacteria requires prolonged anaerobic incubation.

TI  == microbiological, epidemiological and clinical correlates of vaginal colonisation  by mobiluncus species.
AB  == the microbiological and epidemiological correlates of vaginal colonisation by mobiluncus species were examined among randomly selected women attending a sexually transmitted disease (std) clinic. women positive for trichomonas vaginalis were excluded. mobiluncus spp. were detected by gram stained vaginal smear in 21% of 633 std clinic patients, including 53% of those with and 4% of those without bacterial vaginosis (bv), as diagnosed by clinical criteria. gardnerella vaginalis and mycoplasma hominis detected by vaginal culture and mobiluncus detected by vaginal gram stain were each independently associated with bv after adjusting by logistic regression for the presence of sexually transmitted disease pathogens, gravidity, parity and number of lifetime sexual partners (p less than 0.001 for each organism). bacterial vaginosis was negatively correlated with isolation of lactobacilli, yeast and herpes simplex virus. after adjusting for presence or absence of bv, women with mobiluncus were  more likely to harbour g vaginalis (odds ratio 5.6, 95% confidence interval 1.6-19.5), m hominis (or 3.7, 95% ci 2.0-7.0) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (or 2.9,  95% ci 1.4-6.0) and less likely to harbour vaginal yeast (or 0.4, 95% ci 0.2-1.0); were more likely to be black (or 2.7, 95% ci 1.5-4.6), and to have been pregnant (or 1.8, 95% ci 1.1-3.1); but after the adjustment for bv, vaginal colonisation by mobiluncus was not associated with symptoms of odour, abdominal pain, menstrual irregularities, or with adnexal tenderness. in summary, mobiluncus, gardnerella vaginalis and mycoplasma hominis were independently associated with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and mobiluncus was further associated with the presence of bv-associated microorganisms (m hominis and g vaginalis), n gonorrhoeae, black race, and gravidity.

TI  == the effect of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline plus metronidazole on lower genital tract flora in patients with proven pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == alterations in the lower genital tract flora were studied during antimicrobial treatment of 36 women with acute pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). sixteen women received ciprofloxacin, and 20 received doxycycline plus metronidazole. both regimes eradicated chlamydia trachomatis in all cases and neisseria gonorrhoeae in all except one in which combination treatment failed because of resistance of  the organism to tetracycline. both regimes eradicated mycoplasma hominis in all cases, while ciprofloxacin was somewhat less effective than combination treatment against ureaplasma urealyticum. ciprofloxacin was less effective than combination treatment against gardnerella vaginalis. the incidence of candida infection increased equally in both groups, although symptoms necessitating antifungal treatment were rare.

TI  == evaluation of the significance of mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum in female genital tract infection--a retrospective case note study.
AB  == routine screening for sexually transmitted diseases in new patients attending the genitourinary clinic in stoke-on-trent includes a culture for mycoplasma hominis  (mh) and ureaplasma urealyticum (uu). a retrospective study was carried out on 400 female patients to ascertain whether there were any significant differences between the group positive for mh and uu and the negative control group. the positive group were found to be younger on average, but to have similar sexual histories to the negative control group. an association was found between the presence of genital mycoplasmas and gardnerella vaginalis. an odourous vaginal discharge was more common in the positive group. erythromycin was ineffective in  eradicating the organisms in 62.5% of patients with mh, and 70% of those with uu. continuing work is required to identify those women in whom the presence of mh or uu could have pathogenic effects. treatment regimens for this group of women need to be carefully reassessed, in the light of increasing antibiotic resistance.

TI  == association of chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma hominis with intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery. the john hopkins study of cervicitis and adverse pregnancy outcome.
AB  == the authors conducted a prospective study of risk factors for intrauterine growth retardation (birth weight less than a standard (race- and sex-adjusted) 10th percentile for gestational age) and preterm birth (birth prior to 37 weeks gestation) in a high-risk, inner-city, obstetric population, with special interest in pathogens colonizing the maternal genital tract. a total of 801 women within 22 to 30 weeks of gestation were enrolled and interviewed. subjects were cultured for gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococcus, trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis, and candida albicans, and they were followed  to delivery. intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery occurred in 8%  and 13% of these pregnancies, respectively. after adjustment for other important  risk factors, colonization with c. trachomatis was significantly associated both  with intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio = 2.4, 90% confidence interval 1.32-4.18) and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 1.6, 90% confidence interval 1.01-2.50). colonization with c. albicans was significantly associated with intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio = 1.9, 90% confidence interval 1.20-3.14); colonization with m. hominis was significantly associated with preterm birth (odds ratio = 2.0, 90% confidence interval 1.42-2.93). these associations support the probable role of infection in preterm and intrauterine growth retardation births and suggest the need for carefully designed intervention studies.

TI  == a case-control study of chorioamnionic infection and histologic chorioamnionitis  in prematurity.
AB  == to study the role of infection in prematurity, we studied the demographic and obstetrical characteristics, chorioamnionic cultures, and placental histologic features of women who delivered prematurely and compared these findings with those in women who delivered at term. microorganisms were isolated from the area  between the chorion and the amnion (chorioamnion) in 23 of 38 placentas (61 percent) from women with preterm labor who delivered before 37 weeks' gestation and in 12 (21 percent) of 56 placentas from women without preterm labor who delivered at term (odds ratio, 5.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 15.6). the most frequent isolates from the placentas of those whose infants were delivered prematurely were ureaplasma urealyticum (47 percent) and gardnerella vaginalis (26 percent). the recovery of any organism from the chorioamnion was strongly associated with histologic chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 7.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 19.5) and with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio, 3.2;  95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.6). when multiple logistic regression was used to control for demographic and obstetrical variables, premature delivery was still related to the recovery of organisms from the chorioamnion (odds ratio, 3.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 9.9) and with chorioamnionitis (odds  ratio, 5.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 15.3). the proportion of placentas with evidence of infection was highest among those who delivered at the lowest gestational age. we conclude that infection of the chorioamnion is strongly related to histologic chorioamnionitis and may be a cause of premature birth.

TI  == [genital infections and the course of pregnancy: a prospective study].
AB  == the reported study investigates the relationship of genital infections, pathobiochemical findings and demographic data to preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes (prom) and premature delivery. the predictability of chorioamnionitis, puerperal and neonatal infections by these parameters was evaluated concurrently. 301 patients were included in this study between july 1985 and june 1986. 147 of these patients were studied longitudinally during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium (longitudinal group). a second group consisted of 154 women who presented themselves on start of labor to the labor and delivery unit of our department (peripartal group). the incidence of preterm labor and of  prom was 26%. the incidence of premature delivery, chorioamnionitis, puerperal and neonatal infection was 11.4%, 5.5%, 7.6% and 3% respectively. cervical colonization with mycoplasma hominis correlated positively with prom (relative risk 2.2), premature delivery (3.9) and neonatal infection (6.9). chorioamnionitis, premature delivery and puerperal infection were also significantly increased in patients with positive vaginal ureaplasma urealyticum  cultures during pregnancy and delivery. premature delivery (2.8) and puerperal infection (4.0) were associated with a vaginal group b-streptococci (gbs) colonization during pregnancy, as was a positive gbs culture during delivery associated with puerperal infection. bacterial vaginosis also correlated positively with premature delivery (5.6) and puerperal infection. preterm labor correlated negatively with the socioeconomic level, prom correlated negatively with the marital status, positively with age, a history of cervical cerclage, conization or prom during former pregnancies. sexual intercourse more often than  once weekly during the last month of pregnancy was also associated with an increased number of prom. gardnerella vaginalis, candida and trichomoniasis during pregnancy and delivery were associated with preterm labor and puerperal infections. levels of maternal plasma fibrinogen concentrations in patients with  prom were elevated 48 hours after delivery in accordance to the characteristics of acute phase proteins. in contrast, the maternal pmn-granulocyte-elastase concentration was significantly elevated at time of delivery and 24 hours thereafter in those patients who developed puerperal infections. the derived positive predictive value was 26%, the negative 94.7%, respectively. the overall  accuracy of the prediction was 83.1%. six out of seven mothers with neonates treated because of neonatal infection showed significantly elevated plasma concentration of pmn-granulocyte-elastase.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == in a preliminary study of the transmission rate of ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma species, gardnerella vaginalis, b-streptococci, candida species and chlamydia trachomatis from the mother to the newborn, swabs were taken from 45 parturients and their neonates and cultured by suitable methods. out of 30 parturients with a positive culture, 8 harboured more than one microorganism investigated. u. urealyticum was found in 11 newborn and all of them had a positive mother. candida spp. were found in 4 newborn, but 3 of these had a negative mother. g. vaginalis was detected in only 1 infant and the mother was negative. c. trachomatis was not isolated from any mother but was present in 2 newborn infants. thus only u. urealyticum showed clear evidence of transmission from mother to baby.

TI  == bacteriuria due to ureaplasmas and other fastidious organisms during pregnancy: prevalence and significance.
AB  == when urine, which has been collected by suprapubic bladder aspiration, is appropriately cultured, asymptomatic bacteriuria due to fastidious organisms can  be detected quite commonly in apparently healthy pregnant women; ureaplasma urealyticum and gardnerella vaginalis can each be isolated from the bladder urine of 10 to 15% of subjects, other bacteria less frequently. both organisms are often present together, sometimes in addition to "conventional" urinary pathogens. overall bacteriuria occurs in about 25% of healthy pregnant women, including 6% with "conventional" asymptomatic bacteriuria. pyuria occurs in about one-third of patients with fastidious bacteriuria. bacteriuria due to fastidious  bacteria occurs significantly more commonly in selected groups of pregnant women. u. urealyticum or g. vaginalis or both can be isolated, generally in relatively high numbers from more than 70% of pregnant women with renal disease and 20 to 30% of those with preeclampsia. in a prospective study in which urine was collected using an open ended catheter, ureaplasmas were isolated 3 times more frequently from women less than 25 years of age than from older women. women with ureaplasma bacteriuria at the first antenatal visit were 3 times more likely to develop preeclampsia than those without, but the mean birth weights of the infants born to the two groups of women were not significantly different. further studies are required to determine the importance of these preliminary findings.

TI  == high-level tetracycline resistance in neisseria gonorrhoeae is result of acquisition of streptococcal tetm determinant.
AB  == recently, strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae have been isolated which are highly resistant to tetracycline (mics of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml). this resistance was due to the acquisition of the resistance determinant tetm, a transposon-borne determinant initially found in the genus streptococcus and more recently in mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and gardnerella vaginalis. in n. gonorrhoeae, the tetm determinant was located on a 25.2-megadalton plasmid. this  plasmid arose from the insertion of tetm into the 24.5-megadalton gonococcal conjugative plasmid. the tetm determinant could be transferred to suitable recipient strains of n. gonorrhoeae by both genetic transformation and conjugation.

AB  == the in vitro activity of tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and two recently developed 1-aryl-fluoroquinolones, a56610 and a56620, was tested against 65 beta-lactamase-negative and 35 beta-lactamase-positive neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 12 chlamydia trachomatis, 50 mycoplasma hominis, 28 ureaplasma urealyticum and 50 gardnerella vaginalis strains. in the case of chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma hominis both the mic and the mbc were determined. the  mic90 of ciprofloxacin for neisseria gonorrhoeae was 0.008 microgram/ml and of a56619 and a56620 less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. no difference was observed between the activity against beta-lactamase-negative and beta-lactamase-positive strains. the mic90 values of of ciprofloxacin and a56620  for chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum were identical, the values being 2 micrograms/ml, 1 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml  respectively. the mic90 of a56619 for chlamydia trachomatis and ureaplasma urealyticum was 0.5 micrograms/ml and 1 microgram/ml respectively. the mbc90 values of the three quinolones for chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma hominis were less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. the activity of the quinolones against gardnerella vaginalis was rather low, the mic90 being greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. it is concluded that a56619 and a56620 might be useful  for single-dose therapy of gonococcal infections.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis-associated balanoposthitis.
AB  == the clinical features, microbiologic investigation, and response to therapy of three patients with gardnerella vaginalis-associated balanoposthitis were studied. each man presented with a similar syndrome of diffuse erythema and pruritus of the glans meatus and coronal sulcus, irritation of the prepuce, and minimal urethral discharge. a characteristic fishy odor was present in the urethral discharge of all three patients. g. vaginalis was isolated from the glans of all three, and clue cells were present in two. in all cases, cultures for candida albicans, herpes simplex virus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, and ureaplasma urealyticum were negative. all three patients responded to oral therapy with metronidazole and concurrent treatment of the partner. two patients subsequently relapsed but ultimately responded to clindamycin therapy. these men presented with a distinctive clinical syndrome of  balanoposthitis associated with g. vaginalis, which is in many respects similar to the syndrome of bacterial vaginosis in women. our data indicate that balanoposthitis may have a polymicrobial and synergistic etiology involving g. vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria in the male lower genital tract; such an etiology is analogous to that of bacterial vaginosis.

AB  == transfundal endometrial cultures obtained from afebrile women who delivered vaginally were uniformly free of bacteria and contained ureaplasma urealyticum in only 2 of 14 women. a protected triple-lumen transcervical method to obtain an endometrial culture recovered organisms from 6 (43%) of the 14 women. compared with cultures from afebrile women, organisms were recovered from 51 (93%) of 55 febrile postpartum women by using the triple-lumen transcervical culture method (p less than .001). among febrile women there was a correlation between the recovery of group b streptococcus, enterococcus, gardnerella vaginalis, staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria from the cervix and their recovery  from the endometrium. protected transcervical methods used to obtain postpartum endometrial cultures reduce cervical contamination, but semiquantitation of the culture is useful to further increase culture specificity.

TI  == sexually transmissible infectious agents in sexually active and virginal asymptomatic adolescent girls.
AB  == sixty-eight sexually active and 52 virginal adolescent girls were evaluated for six sexually transmissible infectious agents: gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. there were significant differences between sexually active and virginal girls with respect to the prevalence of isolation of u urealyticum (75% v 33%, p less than .005), m hominis (27% v 10%, p less than .05), and c trachomatis (19% v 2%, p less than .025) but not for g vaginalis (34% v 17%, p = .09). n gonorrhoeae and t vaginalis were isolated exclusively from sexually active girls, but their low prevalence (6% and 9%, respectively) made the difference statistically insignificant (p = .2 and .06, respectively). race,  current v previous sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, oral contraceptive  use, and concurrent isolation of another organism did not identify those at increased risk for chlamydial isolation. such girls were significantly more likely to have inflammatory papanicolaou smears (36% v 10%, p less than .05) and  excessive wbc in their vaginal secretions (50% v 19%, p = .05). the data support  the contention that c trachomatis, n gonorrhoeae, and t vaginalis are organisms that are predominantly acquired via sexual routes. significant nonsexual modes of transmission are supported by the data for the genital mycoplasmas and g vaginalis. finally, a history of sexual activity in an adolescent female warrants specific diagnostic testing for chlamydia.

TI  == etiology of cervical inflammation.
AB  == we studied the relationships of selected microbial, clinical, demographic, and behavioral variables to mucopurulent cervicitis in two clinical settings, a sexually transmitted disease clinic and a student health clinic. from each clinic, we studied a group of women referred for suspected mucopurulent cervicitis and a representative sample of other women attending the clinic. after the women were stratified by patient group and summary odds ratios for all groups were obtained, mucopurulent cervicitis was most strongly associated with the isolation of chlamydia trachomatis; other variables associated with mucopurulent  cervicitis included the isolation of ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, and trichomonas vaginalis, the presence of serum antibody to c. trachomatis, the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and oral contraceptive use (positive associations) or isolation of yeast (negative association). after adjustment for cervical culture results for c. trachomatis, mucopurulent cervicitis was positively associated with oral contraceptive use (p  = 0.02) and isolation of u. urealyticum (p = 0.02) and negatively associated with isolation of yeast (p = 0.03). among women with a positive cervical culture for c. trachomatis, isolation of u. urealyticum was significantly associated with mucopurulent cervicitis, while among the subgroup of women with a negative cervical culture for c. trachomatis and positive serum antibody to c. trachomatis, oral contraceptive use was strongly associated with mucopurulent cervicitis. these results confirm that in both clinical settings c. trachomatis is the major cause of mucopurulent cervicitis. the roles of u. urealyticum, t. vaginalis, g. vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, and oral contraceptive use in the etiology of mucopurulent cervicitis deserve further study.

TI  == microbiology of the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls: differences by sexual activity, contraception, and presence of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  == the prevalence of selected microorganisms in the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls was assessed, including vaginal gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococcus, lactobacillus, mycoplasma species, ureaplasma urealyticum, staphylococcus aureus, and yeast, and endocervical mycoplasma species, u. urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and trichomonas vaginalis. specific attention was focused on important sexually transmitted disease organisms, and differences in isolations by age, sexual activity, ethnicity, contraception, and the diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis were measured. sexually active subjects had a mean of 6.05 organisms (sd = 3.16), compared with 3.12 organisms (sd = 3.92) in non-sexually active subjects (p = 0.001). sexually active subjects had significantly more vaginal g. vaginalis, lactobacilli, mycoplasma species, and u. urealyticum, as well as endocervical mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum, compared with non-sexually active subjects; c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoea, and t. vaginalis were isolated exclusively from the sexually active group. significant differences in isolation  rates by ethnicity were found in vaginal mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum, and endocervical mycoplasma species, u. urealyticum, c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, and t. vaginalis. in general, organisms were isolated from blacks most frequently; n. gonorrhoea was isolated from blacks exclusively. differences  were found in microbiologic isolations by the presence or absence of nonspecific  vaginitis. vaginal g. vaginalis and mycoplasma species and endocervical mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum were found significantly more often in isolates from the group with nonspecific vaginitis. it is important to define the microbial flora of the lower genital tract in adolescent girls in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis.

TI  == [detection of gardnerella vaginalis in the pathogen spectrum of sexually transmissible diseases in vulvovaginitis].
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis, a sexually transmittable organism, is regarded as the indicator of the so-called "non-specific vaginitis". the isolation rate of g. vaginalis from 72 women attending our out-patient department during one year because of urogenital complaints was higher in pretreated than in untreated patients. in genital swabs taken from untreated patients, g. vaginalis could be isolated only in 17%, whereas this was observed in 38% of the specimens from women pretreated with various antimicrobial agents. in 9% of the women without vaginal discharge g. vaginalis was isolated. in specimens obtained from 53% of the women positive for g. vaginalis further organisms such as chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida albicans, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma spp. and b-streptococci could be isolated. asymptomatic infections with neisseria gonorrhoeae (1) and c. trachomatis (4) were also observed. the present study clearly demonstrates that a broad microbiological examination is essential for specific therapy in vaginitis. even if unspecific vaginitis is diagnosed by the presence of clue-cells, increased vaginal ph and fishy odour, a  combined infection by further sexually transmittable organisms, especially n. gonorrhoeae, is to be excluded.

AB  == certain fastidious organisms such as u urealyticum and g vaginalis can be isolated from the aspirated bladder urine of pregnant women more frequently than  conventional urinary pathogens such as escherichia coli [1]. they can be isolated even more often from the aspirated bladder urine of patients with renal disease,  but rarely from that of healthy men or nonpregnant women [2]. we investigated the incidence of bacteriuria due to these two organisms--particularly u urealyticum--in patients with preeclampsia. u urealyticum was isolated more frequently (rate, 20%), and usually in higher colony counts, from the urine of patients with preeclampsia than from that of healthy pregnant women (rate, 7%). g vaginalis was isolated with approximately the same frequency as u urealyticum from specimens of bladder urine; both organisms were isolated from the urine of 11 patients (eight healthy women and three with preeclampsia). high colony counts of g vaginalis were also found more frequently in patients with preeclampsia. in  both groups other fastidious organisms were isolated in a total of only five patients, and in four of these five cases u urealyticum and/or g vaginalis were also isolated from the same specimen. urine cultures were more frequently positive in patients with moderately severe hypertension (blood pressure, greater than 160/100 mm hg) than in those with mild hypertension (blood pressure, 140/90-160/100 mm hg, occurring in nine (53%) of 17 patients and in nine (26.5%)  of 34 patients, respectively. this difference was not statistically significant.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum (t-mycoplasma), and hemophilus vaginalis have previously been considered possible etiological agents in nongonococcal urethritis (ngu). in this study, current c. trachomatis infection was confirmed by culture and (or) micro-immunofluorescence serology in 26 of 69 men experiencing afirst episode of ngu, and 1 of 39 with no urethritis. serum igm immunofluorescent antibody to chlamydia was demonstrated in 16 of 20 men with chlamydia culture positive ngu, and 3 of 39 with chlamydia culture negative ng, and none of 34 with no urethritis. 9 of 10 culture positive men with less than or equal to 10 days symptoms developed immunofluorescent antibody seroconversion in  paired sera. u. realyticum was isolated significantly more often and in significantly higher concentration from first voided urine from chlamydia-negative cases of ngu than from chlamydia-positive ngu. ureaplasmacidal antibody titers increased fourfold in six men, four of whom had negative cultures for for unreaplasma. h. vaginalis was isolated from c9 of 33 men with no urethritis and 2 of 69 with ngu. c. trachomatis is susceptible, and u. urealyticum is resistant to sulfonamides. a 10-day course of sulfisoxazole therapy produced improvement in 13 of 13 chlamydia-positive, unreaplasma-negative, and only 14 of 29 chlamydia-negative, unreaplasma-positive  ngu cases (p less than 0.002). thus, culture, serology, and response to therapy support the etiologic role of chlamydia in ngu. quantitative culture and response to therapy suggest u. unrealyticum may cause many cases of chlamydia-netative ngu.
