TI  == evaluation of bacterial nitrate reduction in the human oral cavity.
AB  == it is hypothesized that the enterosalivary nitrate circulation encourages nitrate reducing bacteria to reside within the oral cavity. nitrite production may then limit the growth of acidogenic bacteria as a result of the production of antimicrobial oxides of nitrogen, including nitric oxide. this study was carried  out with 10 subjects to characterize oral nitrate reduction and identify the bacteria responsible. nitrate reduction varied between individuals (mean 85.4 +/- 15.9 nmol nitrite min(-1) with 10 ml 1 mm kno(3) mouth wash) and was found to be  concentrated at the rear of the tongue dorsal surface. nitrate reductase positive isolates identified, using 16s rdna sequencing, from the tongue comprised veillonella atypica (34%), veillonella dispar (24%), actinomyces odontolyticus (21%), actinomyces naeslundii (2%), rothia mucilaginosa (10%), rothia dentocariosa (3%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (5%). nitrite production rates,  using intact and permeabilized cells, of the major tongue nitrate reducers were determined in the presence of methyl and benzyl viologen. under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, rates in decreasing order were: a. odontolyticus > r. mucilaginosa > r. dentocariosa > v. dispar > v. atypica. in conclusion, veillonella spp. were found to be the most prevalent taxa isolated and thus may make a major contribution to nitrate reduction in the oral cavity.

TI  == biosurfactant from lactococcus lactis 53 inhibits microbial adhesion on silicone  rubber.
AB  == the ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). the results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of staphylococcus epidermidis gb 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), streptococcus salivarius gb 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and staphylococcus aureus gb 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. the deposition rates of rothia dentocariosa gbj 52/2b, candida albicans gbj 13/4a, and candida tropicalis gb 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. this study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.

TI  == rothia dentocariosa endocarditis complicated by perivalvular abscess.
AB  == a 35-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use developed endocarditis due to rothia dentocariosa that was complicated by a perivalvular abscess. despite combined medical and surgical treatment, abscess formation progressed following aortic valve replacement, and the patient died during a second operative procedure. this is the sixth case of rothia dentocariosa endocarditis reported in the english-language literature, and to our knowledge, the only case  in which a perivalvular abscess has been documented.
