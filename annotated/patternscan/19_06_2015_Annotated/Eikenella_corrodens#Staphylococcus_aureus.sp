TI  == recurrent infective endocarditis due to aggregatibacter aphrophilus and staphylococcus lugdunensis.
AB  == uncommon microorganisms are increasingly being recognized as causative agents of  paediatric infectious endocarditis (ie). we report a 4-year old girl with congenital heart disease, who suffered from 2 ie episodes secondary to aggregatibacter aphrophilus (formerly haemophilus aphrophilus) and staphylococcus lugdunensis, both rarely reported pathogens in this age group. the patient was initially successfully treated with prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses, however removal of the contegra valved conduit during the second episode was required due to recurrence of fever and development of pulmonary embolism despite completion of antibiotic therapy. a. aphrohilus is a member of the fastidious gram negative microorganisms of the hacek group (haemophilus spp., aggregatibacter spp, cardiobaterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella kingae), that colonize the oropharynx and are a recognised cause of ie. prognosis of children with ie due to hacek group members varies, half of them suffering from complications and mortality rates of 10-12.5%. although s. lugdunensis belongs to coagulase negative staphylococci (cons), it behaves more like s. aureus species rather than cons. this microorganism is a well-described cause of  endocarditis in adult patients, associated with high requirements of surgical procedures and mortality (42-78%). in conclusion, paediatric ie can be caused by  uncommon microorganisms associated with severe complications and potential fatality. the isolation of s. lugdunensis or a. aphrophilus in febrile patients should be considered clinically relevant and cardiac involvement must be ruled out. those patients with proved ie will require prolonged intravenous antibiotic  courses and in complicated cases surgical intervention.

TI  == endocarditis in a large district general hospital: a study of the microbiological spectrum between 2000 and 2011.
AB  == infective endocarditis is one of three common cardiac infections in the united kingdom, in addition to myocarditis and pericarditis, with a reported incidence of 1.7 to 6.2 cases per 100,000 patient years. infective endocarditis can often have serious consequences and a wide variety of organisms may be the causative pathogen. there are little published data regarding the exact spectrum of organisms that cause endocarditis in the united kingdom and whether organisms such as streptococci still dominate. in the present study, all cases of endocarditis at the authors' institution, representing a typical nontertiary centre, were retrospectively examined and audited to provide a snapshot of the organism spectrum in these patients. the cases of more than 120 patients who were coded as having endocarditis by the institution's clinical coding department during the period between december 2000 and january 2011 were examined. microbiological tests and clinical case notes of all patients were reviewed. of the 101 patients diagnosed with and treated for endocarditis, 64 were male, with  a mean age of 60.57 years. the most common organisms identified were streptococcus species (31%), staphylococcus aureus (27%) and enterococcus faecalis (21%). the organisms with the highest associated mortality rate were s aureus and the 'other organism' group, which included non-hacek group (haemophilus species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella species) pathogens such as candida albicans. streptococcus species and s aureus remain the main cause of endocarditis in a typical hospital setting in the united kingdom, although in a smaller proportion of cases than historical data suggests. overall, mortality remains high, and the clinician should remain vigilant to endocarditis in any patient with a positive blood culture because the number of cases of endocarditis caused by less typical organisms are increasing.

TI  == microbiology of third and fourth branchial pouch cysts.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: to identify the most common pathogens involved in infections of third and fourth branchial pouch cysts. third and fourth branchial  pouch cyst infections are an uncommon cause of anterior neck abscesses often confused with other entities, such as thyroglossal duct cysts and thyroid abscesses leading to misdiagnosis, recurrence, and increased morbidity related to a delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. study design: retrospective chart and literature review. methods: retrospective chart review case series of patients presenting to the bobby r. alford department of otolaryngology at texas  children's hospital from july 2004 to july 2008 with third and fourth branchial pouch cysts. results: a total of 11 patients were identified. all patients had left-sided lesions. eikenella corrodens was found in 60% of cultures and was the  most common organism identified in our patient group. furthermore, 56% of the organisms isolated were anaerobic. all organisms with the exception of staphylococcus aureus were identified as oral cavity flora. conclusions: third and fourth branchial pouch cysts provide a communication between the neck and the oral cavity through pyriform sinus tracts. the presence of oral cavity flora in a left anterior neck abscess should raise the suspicion of a branchial pouch anomaly, and subsequently alter therapeutic management.

TI  == the bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. however, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include:  anaerobic gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas); fusobacterium spp; and peptostreptococcus spp. in addition, streptococcus spp (including streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have been reported. aerobic and facultative  gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are haemophilus influenzae, treponema pallidum, bartonella henselae, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. the choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == staphylococcus lugdunensis, a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections in  the community.
AB  == staphylococcus lugdunensis, a rare cause of severe infections such as native valve endocarditis, often causes superficial skin infections similar to staphylococcus aureus infections. we initiated a study to optimize the identification methods in the routine laboratory, followed by a population-based  epidemiologic analysis of patients infected with s. lugdunensis in viborg county, denmark. recognition of a characteristic eikenella corrodens-like odor on columbia sheep blood agar combined with colony pleomorphism and prominent beta-hemolysis after 2 days of incubation, confirmed by api-id-32 staph, led to an 11-fold increase in the detection of s. lugdunensis. by these methods we found 491 s. lugdunensis infections in 4 years, corresponding to an incidence of 53 per 100,000 per year, an increase from 5 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the preceding years. seventy-five percent of the cases were found in general practice; these were dominated by skin abscesses (36%), wound infections (25%), and paronychias (13%). fifty-six percent of the infections occurred below the waist, and toes were the most frequently infected site (21%). only 3% of the patients suffered from severe invasive infections. the median age was 52 years, and the male/female ratio was 0.69. our study shows that s. lugdunensis is a common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections (ssti) and is probably underrated by many laboratories. s. lugdunensis should be accepted as a significant pathogen in ssti and should be looked for in all routine bacteriological examinations, and clinicians should be acquainted with the name and the pathology of the bacterium.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.

TI  == causative microorganisms in surgically treated pediatric hand infections.
AB  == purpose: the causative organisms in many pediatric musculoskeletal infections are distinct from their adult counterparts. we investigated the organisms found in surgically treated hand infections in the pediatric population. methods: we reviewed the hospital charts and computer records of all patients who had surgical intervention for infections of the forearm, wrist, and hand from 1996 through 2002 at the children's hospital of boston. results: thirty-eight surgical procedures were performed on 31 children for 32 different upper-extremity infections. one patient was treated for 2 separate infections. in the 32 primary  procedures 7 cultures grew mixed aerobic/anaerobic organisms, 19 grew aerobic organisms only, 6 grew no organisms, and 2 patients had no cultures. one culture  from a secondary surgery was positive for candida parapsilosis. staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 15 of the primary cases and was the primary organism in 12. five of 7 mixed infections were associated with paronychia; 2 of the paronychial infections were complicated by flexor tenosynovitis. chronic nail biting caused 2 infections and 1 was associated with thumb sucking. conclusions:  in the adult population s aureus is the primary organism cultured in 50% to 80% of cases and anaerobic or mixed infection may occur in upward of 29% of patients. in this series s aureus was the primary organism in only 37%. group a streptococcus pyogenes was present in 20% of cases. the percentage of children with a mixed aerobic/anaerobic infection was similar to that found in adults; however, the presumed route of introduction was digital sucking/biting. based on  the number of anaerobic/mixed infections without predisposing factors we recommend a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen including anaerobic coverage as the initial antibiotic in the setting of pediatric hand infections.

TI  == facial bite wounds: management update.
AB  == bite wounds are frequently located on the face; injuries inflicted by dogs are most common, especially in children. bacteriology of infected dog and cat bite wounds includes pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, capnocytophaga canimorsus, and oral anaerobes. infected human bites yield a similar spectrum of bacteria except for pasteurellae and c. canimorsus; instead human bites are frequently complicated by eikenella corrodens. antibiotic therapy against these bacteria is indicated both for infected bite wounds and fresh wounds considered at risk for infection. amoxicillin-clavulanate (and other combinations of extended-spectrum penicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors) and moxifloxacin offer the best in vitro coverage of the pathogenic flora. initial wound management consisting in irrigation and debridement is at least equally important with antibiotics for prevention of infection. the need for prophylaxis  against systemic infectious complications, particularly tetanus, should also be evaluated. primary surgical repair is the treatment of choice for most clinically uninfected facial bite wounds, whereas delayed closure should be reserved for certain high risk or already infected wounds. avulsive injuries with significant  tissue loss represent the most difficult cases for definitive management and are  also those most likely to require hospitalization.

TI  == [surgical therapy for hand infections. part i].
AB  == due to its function, anatomy, and exposition to multiple pathogens, the hand is highly susceptible to infection. most of these infections are post-traumatic. isolates of pathogens from infected hands contain mainly staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic group a streptococci. we find pasteurella canis and p. multocida from cat and dog bite wounds and eikenella corrodens from human bite wounds. the "fight-bite clenched fist" wound, with penetration of the metacarpophalangeal joint and its high risk of septic arthritis, has always to be suspected when patients present with human bites. the therapy of hand infection is based on three principles: surgical treatment, adequate antimicrobial therapy, and early physiotherapy. early infectious conditions of the hand, e.g. cellulitis and early paronychia, may be treated without surgery. antimicrobial treatment must be specific for the pathogen and its resistance to antimicrobial agents. bite wounds should be treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors. staphylococci and streptococci can be covered by first and second generation cephalosporins. the increasing resistance of staphylococci to antibiotics has to be taken into account. infections with anaerobic and gas-producing bacteria are rare but occur predominantly in diabetics and immune-compromised individuals.

TI  == [bite wound infections].
AB  == background: the lifetime risk of experiencing a bite wound, human or animal, is approximately 50%, and bite wounds account for approximately 1% of all visits to  emergency departments. the majority of bite wounds are inflicted by dogs and cats. material and methods: a review of the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of bite wound infections is presented. results: the most common pathogens associated with bite wounds are streptococcus species, staphylococcus species, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus and anaerobic bacteria. sporadically other pathogens are isolated from bite wounds. human bites differ from animal bites by higher prevalence of staphylococcus aureus and eikenella corrodens. interpretation: it is important to be aware of the possibility of complicating infections following bite wounds, particularly after cat bites. phenoxymethyl penicillin should be the drug of choice in treatment of infections  associated with cat and dog bites. however, in case of slow recovery or no improvement, simultaneous lymphadenopathy or pneumonia, s. aureus or francisella  tularensis should be suspected; ciprofloxacin is recommended. for human bite infections the recommend treatment is phenoxymethyl penicillin in combination with penicillinase-stable penicillin.

TI  == clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  == previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. we conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. most injuries were to the hands. fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. the median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. isolates included streptococcus anginosus (52%), staphylococcus aureus (30%), eikenella corrodens (30%), fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and prevotella melaninogenica (22%). candida species were found in 8%. fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, and candida species  were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. many strains of prevotella and s. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation on root surfaces: an  in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: this in vitro study investigated the antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation on root surfaces. materials and methods: the study  used 125 extracted teeth which were divided into 2 groups (a, b) of 40 teeth and  3 groups of 15 teeth (c, d, e). a defined and similarly-sized area of the root surface was inoculated with an aliquot of 7 microl of a bacterial suspension of escherichia coli (atcc 25922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 43719), eikenella corrodens (atcc 51724), or peptostreptococcus micros (atcc 33270). subsequently, the samples from each group were further divided into subgroups which have been irradiated either with 55, 75, and 105 (group a, b) or 55 and 75 (group c, d, e) laser pulses. 1 subgroup of each group was left untreated as control. the source of laser radiation was an er:yag laser emitting pulsed infrared radiation at a wavelength of 2.94 microm. the number of bacteria was determined using the surface spread plate technique. the statistical analysis was performed using anova followed by the scheffe-test.  results: depending on the number of laser pulses the bacterial load in the e. coli group was reduced by the er:yag laser radiation after exposure to 105 laser  pulses to 5.5% of the initial count and that in the staph. aureus group to 15.1%. the number of bacteria in case of a. actinomytemcomitans was reduced to 8.3%, in  case of e. corrodens to 3.0% and in case of p. micros to 22.0% after application  of 75 laser pulses. conclusion: besides the selective removal of plaque and calculus, the 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation causes reduction in bacteria on  root surfaces.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  == we studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot  for anaerobes. ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/l with only 4/5 campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 campylobacter rectus strains  requiring . or = 16 mg/l for inhibition. ertapenem was only moderately active (mic 8 mg/l) against 4/6 enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 staphylococcus epidermidis strains. all pasteurella multocida, pasteurella septica, pasteurella  canis, pasteurella dagmatis, moraxella spp. and ef-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/l. mic(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/l; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/l; staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/l; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/l; streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/l; eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/l; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/l. for anaerobes the range of mics and mic(90)s were: prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/l; porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/l; fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/l; bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/l; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/l. ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.

TI  == [clinical significance of the streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  == few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. although streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. we studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000.  the streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by eikenella corrodens (9.7%), staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and s. pyogenes (3.2%). the s. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. these species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. since hemolytic patterns of the s. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. we found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the s. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. as antibiotics began  being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

TI  == the changing face of odontogenic infections.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this investigation was to compare characteristics of patients hospitalized with odontogenic infections during the 1980s to those of the 1990s. patients and methods: this study was a retrospective record review that compared 2 cohorts of patients admitted to the same institution during two 81-month periods, one decade apart. admission criteria were face or neck swelling suggesting abscess or cellulitis and one or more of the following: temperature above 38 degrees c, white blood cell (wbc) count greater than 10.8 x 10(3)/microl, or concern about airway compromise. characteristics reviewed were age, gender, race, admission temperature, admission wbc count, fascial space(s) involved, tooth of etiology, duration of hospitalization, and bacteria isolated.  data were compared for statistical significance (p <.05). results: no significant differences were found between the 2 cohorts for age, gender, race, admission temperature, admission wbc count, space involvement, or length of stay (p <.05).  one tooth (mandibular left first molar) of 52 was involved more frequently in the 1990 group (p <.03). gram-positive cocci were isolated significantly more frequently from the 1990s patients than from the 1980s patients (p <.03). there were also significant differences (p <.02) between cohorts in the isolation frequency of individual genera, such as alpha-hemolytic streptococci, coagulase negative staphylococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides melanogenicus, beta-lactamase positive bacteroides, eikenella corrodens, and neisseria species.  eighty-one percent of the bacteria cultured from the 1990s patients were resistant to one or more common antibiotics; 47% of these organisms were staphylococcus aureus. conclusion: no clinically significant differences existed  in the characteristics of patients hospitalized with odontogenic infections between the 1980s and the 1990s. although there were differences in the type and  prevalence of bacteria isolated, this was probably a result of changes in nomenclature, identification protocols, and isolation techniques.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft-tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  == we studied the comparative in vitro activities of abt-773, a new ketolide, against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic recent isolates from clinical bites using an agar dilution method and inocula of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu for anaerobes. the following are the mic ranges and mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of abt-773 for various isolates, respectively: pasteurella multocida and pasteurella septica, 0.125 to 2 and 1 microg/ml; other  pasteurella species, 0.125 to 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.015 to 0.06 and 0.015 microg/ml; staphylococcus aureus, 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.06 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 0.015 to >32 and 32 microg/ml; streptococci, 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.03 microg/ml; eikenella corrodens, 0.25 to 1 and 1 microg/ml; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.06 microg/ml. for anaerobes the mic  ranges and mic(90)s of abt-773 were as follows, respectively: prevotella heparinolytica, 0. 06 to 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml; prevotella spp., 0.015 to 0.125 and 0.06 microg/ml; porphyromonas spp., 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.015 microg/ml;  fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5 to 8 and 8 microg/ml; other fusobacterium spp., 0.015 to 8 and 0.5 microg/ml; bacteroides tectum, 0.015 to 0.5 and 0.06 microg/ml; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.015 to 0.25 and 0.03 microg/ml. abt-773 was more active than all macrolides tested against s. aureus, e. corrodens, and anaerobes, but all compounds were poorly active against f. nucleatum. the activity of abt-773 was within 1 dilution of that of azithromycin against pasteurella spp., and abt-773 was four- to eightfold more active than clarithromycin against pasteurella spp. abt-773 may offer a therapeutic alternative for bite wound infections.

TI  == septic arthritis of the hand and wrist.
AB  == septic arthritis of the hand and wrist is relatively uncommon. the most common cause is penetrating trauma such as a human or animal bite. the most common causative organism is staphylococcus aureus. septic arthritis caused by streptococcal species. haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia species, neisseria gonorrhoeae, pasteurella multocida, eikenella corrodens, and mycobacterium marinum also may occur in specific clinical settings. the best clinical results occur following an accurate diagnosis, prompt surgical drainage, and debridement in concert with appropriate antibiotics and early postoperative range of motion. a delay in diagnosis or treatment is associated with an unsatisfactory outcome.

AB  == infectious endocarditis was diagnosed in four patients, men aged 18, 44, 35 and 22; the bacteria involved were streptococcus viridans, eikenella corrodens, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans, respectively. in all patients mycotic aneurysms were observed which had led to seemingly unrelated neurological or abdominal complaints. in one patient an aneurysm of the a. cerebri media resolved in two years, another patient died following fatal bleeding of a ruptured aneurysm in the a. hepatica propria. mycotic aneurysms may be found in all parts of the body. this complication is often diagnosed too late because it is not considered.

TI  == subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.

TI  == outpatient treatment of endocarditis in a clinic-based program in argentina.
AB  == the major cost in the treatment of infective endocarditis (ie) is the length of hospitalization required for the administration of intravenous antibiotics. this  can be reduced by substituting shorter regimens and by the introduction of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (opat). careful selection of patients is vital for the success of opat in ie. the patients should be hemodynamically stable and without clinical complications. the delivery of opat for ie followed a clinical and home-based program involving an endocarditis team whose members included an infectious diseases physician, a microbiologist, a cardiologist and a nurse trained in intravenous techniques. among the antimicrobial agents used in opat of ie, single-agent ceftriaxone for four weeks followed by a short course of amoxicillin or ceftriaxone in combination with an aminoglycoside for two weeks (short course) are effective modes of treatment for streptococcal endocarditis, the most common cause of ie. this treatment is also effective for carefully selected patients with other types of endocarditis, such as those due to the hacek group (haemophilus aphrophilus/paraphrophilis, actinobacillus actinomycetem comitans, caradiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella kingae). staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and late prosthetic valve endocarditis associated with a streptococcus may also be treated on an outpatient basis after  stabilization (approximately 2 weeks). as a result of their need for prolonged treatment periods, these patients are also very good candidates for opat. in conclusion, new regimens utilizing ceftriaxone once daily and short-term therapy  on a clinical or home basis offer the potential benefits of cheaper safer and more convenient treatment for patients with ie.

TI  == microbiology of cerebral abscess: a four-year study in malaysia.
AB  == a prospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology of cerebral abscess in relation to the primary source of infections. seventy-five patients with cerebral abscess were included in the study in the period january 1985 to december 1988. more than half of the patients studied had single lesions and the  overall most common sites were in the frontal and parietal regions. chronic suppurative otitis media, cyanotic congenital heart diseases and meningitis were  among the important predisposing conditions in these patients. approximately 25%  of the patients with cerebral abscesses had no documented antecedent infections.  pure cultures were found to be predominant (66.7%) and sterile cultures were obtained from 10 (13.3%) patients. streptococci were isolated from 23 (30.7%) patients, the commonest species being streptococcus milleri. proteus sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putrifaciens and bacteroides sp were almost exclusively found in cerebral abscesses secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media; these organisms were found in mixed cultures. streptococcus milleri, bacteroides sp and eikenella corrodens were found in pure cultures in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in-situ, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids were common. anaerobes were found in 15 (20.0%) patients, the majority in mixed cultures. culture, as well as gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of volatile fatty acids of cerebral pus, was carried out to enhance the  detection of the anaerobes. based on these findings, an antibiotic regimen consisting of penicillin, chloramphenicol and metronidazole is recommended as an  initial therapy while awaiting culture and sensitivity results.

TI  == microbial composition and pattern of antibiotic resistance in subgingival microbial samples from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  == a series of 993 subgingival microbial samples sent to a diagnostic microbiology laboratory included 196 samples that could be identified as compatible with a clinical diagnosis of refractory or recurrent periodontitis. in descending order  of prevalence the associated microbiota included bacteroides forsythus (84%), spirochetes (83%), motile rods (76%), fusobacterium species (68%), porphyromonas  gingivalis (63%), campylobacter rectus (47%), capnocytophaga species (38%), prevotella intermedia (23%), peptostreptococcus micros (18%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (16%), candida (14%), enteric rods (9%), staphylococcus species, not including aureus (5.6%). eikenella corrodens (3%), staphylococcus aureus (1.5%), and enterococcus species (< 1%). antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, penicillin g, or metronidazole was particularly noticeable for enteric rods, fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, staphylococcus, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. it was largely absent for campylobacter rectus. no antibiotic sensitivity data were obtained for porphyromonas gingivalis or bacteroides forsythus, as these species were detected by immunofluorescence. the results indicate that a substantial number of microorganisms associated with  refractory periodontitis are variably resistant to commonly-used antibiotics. diagnostic microbiology must be considered an essential adjunct to the therapist  faced with periodontal lesions refractory to conventional treatment.

TI  == bite wounds and infection.
AB  == one of every two americans will be bitten by an animal or by another person at some point. bites account for approximately 1% of all visits to emergency rooms;  injuries inflicted by dogs are most common. the bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds include pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  intermedius, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, capnocytophaga canimorsus, and other members of the oral flora. anaerobic bacteria are present in approximately one-third of bite wounds and are associated with the formation of abscesses and with relatively serious infections. p. multocida is found in infections of cat bites more than 50% of the time. the bacteriology of bite wounds inflicted by exotic animals reflects the animals' oral flora. bites inflicted by humans are often more serious than those inflicted by animals. infections of human bites are associated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci, s. aureus, eikenella corrodens, haemophilus species, and (in more than 50% of cases) anaerobic bacteria. the principles of management of bite wounds are discussed.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, l-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  == the attainable inhibitory ratios (ar) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amx/ca), ofloxacin (ofl), l-ofloxacin (l-ofl), cefuroxime (cefu), ciprofloxacin (cip), and enoxacin (eno), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. ar of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the mics achieved at the respiratory  site. bacteria tested included staphylococcus aureus, group-a and group-b streptococci, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, brahamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae,  h. parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella pneumophila. the antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against gram-positive cocci. ofloxacin and l-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ars against respiratory pathogen, including,  l. pneumophila, h. influenzae, and b. catarrhalis. all agents showed no, or inadequately low ars for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == parapneumonic empyema in children: decortication hastens recovery in patients with severe pleural infections.
AB  == the medical records of 61 children 0 to 18 years of age treated for empyema complicating pneumonia from 1977 to 1989 were reviewed with attention to clinical presentation, bacteriology, treatment and outcome. streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by staphylococcus aureus, other streptococcal species, anaerobes, haemophilus influenzae type b, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and eikenella corrodens. no organisms were recovered in 39% of patients. twelve patients were treated successfully with antibiotics and thoracentesis alone, 23 patients underwent close tube thoracostomy and 26 required decortication. a thickened pleural "peel," scoliosis and opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiograph, as well as low pleural ph and glucose concentration, were associated with a poor response to medical management. a scoring system was developed to define the severity of pleural disease. in patients with severe pleural infections, decortication allowed more rapid defervescence (2.2 vs. 6.5 days) and earlier hospital discharge (4.4 vs. 12.4 days) than did closed tube thoracostomy (p less than 0.001).

TI  == controversies in antibiotic choices for bite wounds.
AB  == in the last decade much progress has been made in our understanding of animal bites. two major areas of remaining controversy are discussed. recent study of human bites has shown that the early literature depicting all human bites as having an extraordinarily high infection and complication rate was biased by its  emphasis on human bites of the hand that presented late with infection already present. these bites, the so-called closed-fist injuries (cfi), do indeed have a  poor prognosis, but it may be as much due to their location and initial neglect as to the source of the injury. human bites elsewhere do not seem to have any higher risk than animal bites, which have an infection rate of about 10%. human bites of the face, lips, and ears are at very low risk for infection (less than 3%) if properly treated. the cfi should be identified early and aggressively irrigated and debrided (if possible). cfi wounds can be treated on an outpatient  basis if uninfected and less than 24 hours old. the economical outpatient antibiotics of choice for cfi are penicillin plus dicloxacillin; the former is needed to cover eikenella corrodens and the latter to cover staphylococcus aureus, both common in these wounds. diabetics with hand infection frequently have gram-negative infection and may warrant parenteral aminoglycosides. second-  and third-generation cephalosporins are very effective but should be reserved for special situations due to their expense. prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated for typical bite wounds, which are low risk. the choice of antibiotic (when needed) in other bite wounds is a matter of confusion, because the only scientific data available are in vitro sensitivities, which are a very poor and crude reflection of the clinical reality. antibiotic effectiveness in vivo is dependent on a complex summation of absorption, tissue levels (not just serum levels), host immune defenses, and the interrelationships between bacterial species present. for dog bite wounds, dicloxacillin and cephalexin are both good  choices because they cover most of the broad spectrum of infecting pathogens; dicloxacillin is significantly cheaper.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == comparative activities of cefuroxime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and ofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from bite wounds.
AB  == we studied the comparative in vitro activities of 10 oral antimicrobial agents against 147 aerobic and 61 anaerobic bacteria making up species in 13 genera (staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, eikenella corrodens, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus-actinobacillus spp., m-5, ef-4, moraxella spp., flavobacterium iib, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides spp., fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp.) that were isolated from bite wounds. cefuroxime was generally greater than fourfold more active than cephalexin and cefadroxil against all aerobic isolates, including pasteurella multocida. the fluoroquinolones were highly active against most aerobic isolates but were less active against anaerobic isolates. ciprofloxacin was generally more active than either enoxacin or ofloxacin. discrepancies of greater than 30% in the interpretation of susceptibilities between break points suggested by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards and those related to oral dose peak levels (one-half to one-quarter of maximum achievable concentrations) were noted  in 14% (18 of 130) of the instances.

AB  == an antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody specific for bacteroides gingivalis  was purified in the presence of 0.5% (wt/vol) beta-octyl-glucoside by immunoadsorbent column chromatography. the purified antigen was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and silver staining, and the pattern of sds-page agreed with that of immunoblotting. the molecule exhibited an apparent molecular weight of about 62,000 by sds-page. the antigen was sensitive to trypsin, staphylococcus aureus v8 protease, dnase i and ii, and heating, but insensitive to rnase and neuraminidase. by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, the purified antigen was not cross-reactive with rat polyclonal antibodies to each of several  black-pigmented bacteroides species, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. these results indicate that  the purified antigen is specific for b. gingivalis. humoral antibody titers in adult periodontal patients against the specific antigen were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. serum immunoglobulin g antibody titers against the specific antigen in adult periodontal patients correlated significantly with  the severity of periodontal disease. however, such significant correlation was not observed with serum immunoglobulin m antibody titers.

TI  == efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  == imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. the mean duration of treatment was  29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. causative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, s. aureus plus group b streptococcus in one, viridans group streptococcus in two, neisseria subflava, eikenella corrodens, and group g  streptococcus in one patient, and staphylococcus epidermidis, hemophilus aphrophilus, and enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. the minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04  micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against h. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against e. aerogenes. the site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. the mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. all patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one  patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on day 26 of therapy. imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm  statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.
