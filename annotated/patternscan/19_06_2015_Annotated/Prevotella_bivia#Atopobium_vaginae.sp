TI  == the influence of biofilm formation by gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes on bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the worldwide leading vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age. bv is characterized by the replacement of beneficial lactobacilli and the augmentation of anaerobic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is a predominant bacterial species, however, bv is also associated with other numerous anaerobes, such as atopobium vaginae, mobiluncus mulieris, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptoniphilus sp.. currently, the role of g. vaginalis in the etiology of bv remains a matter of controversy. it is however known that, in bv patients, a biofilm is usually formed on the vaginal epithelium and g. vaginalis is typically the predominant species. so, the current paradigm is that the establishment of a biofilm plays a key role in the pathogenesis of bv. this review provides background on the influence of biofilm formation by g. vaginalis and other anaerobes in the polymicrobial etiology of bv, through its initial adhesion until biofilm formation and discusses the commensal and synergic interactions established between them to understand the phenotypic shift of g. vaginalis' biofilms into bv establishment.

TI  == the significance of lactobacillus crispatus and l. vaginalis for vaginal health and the negative effect of recent sex: a cross-sectional descriptive study across groups of african women.
AB  == background: women in sub-saharan africa are vulnerable to acquiring hiv infection and reproductive tract infections. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a disruption of the  vaginal microbiota, has been shown to be strongly associated with hiv infection.  risk factors related to potentially protective or harmful microbiota species are  not known. methods: we present cross-sectional quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the lactobacillus genus, five lactobacillus species, and three bv-related bacteria (gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and prevotella bivia) together with escherichia coli and candida albicans in 426 african women across different groups at risk for hiv. we selected a reference group of adult hiv-negative women at average risk for hiv acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, hiv-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of hiv-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. we explored the associations between presence and quantity of the bacteria with bv by nugent score, in relation to several factors of known or theoretical importance. results: the presence of species across kenyan, south african and rwandan women was remarkably similar and few differences were seen between the two groups of reference women in kenya and south africa. the rwandan sex workers and hiv-positive women had the highest g. vaginalis presence (p = 0.006). pregnant women had a higher lactobacillus genus mean log (7.01 genome equivalents (geq)/ml) compared to the reference women (6.08 geq/ml). l. vaginalis (43%) was second to l. iners (81.9%) highly present in women with a normal nugent score. recent sexual exposure negatively affected the presence of l. crispatus (<0.001), l. vaginalis (p = 0.001), and lactobacillus genus (p < 0.001). having more than one sexual partner in the last three months was associated with an increased prevalence of g. vaginalis (p = 0.044) and l. iners (p = 0.001). conclusions: although the composition of species across the studied african countries was similar, the presence of protective species i.e. l. crispatus and l. vaginalis in women with a normal nugent score appeared lower compared to non-african studies.  furthermore, lactobacillus species were negatively affected by sexual behavioural. strategies to support protective lactobacillus species are urgently  needed. trial registration: the study is registered at the trial registration at  the national health research ethics council south africa with the number doh2709103223.

TI  == bacteria in the vaginal microbiome alter the innate immune response and barrier properties of the human vaginal epithelia in a species-specific manner.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis increases the susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections and negatively affects women's reproductive health. methods: to investigate host-vaginal microbiota interactions and the impact on immune barrier function, we colonized 3-dimensional (3-d) human vaginal epithelial cells with 2 predominant species of vaginal microbiota (lactobacillus  iners and lactobacillus crispatus) or 2 prevalent bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (atopobium vaginae and prevotella bivia). results: colonization of 3-d vaginal epithelial cell aggregates with vaginal microbiota was observed with direct attachment to host cell surface with no cytotoxicity. a. vaginae infection yielded increased expression membrane-associated mucins and evoked a robust proinflammatory, immune response in 3-d vaginal epithelial cells  (ie, expression of ccl20, hbd-2, interleukin 1beta, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) that can negatively affect barrier function. however, p. bivia and l. crispatus did not significantly upregulate pattern-recognition receptor-signaling, mucin expression, antimicrobial peptides/defensins, or proinflammatory cytokines in 3-d vaginal epithelial cell aggregates. notably, l. iners induced pattern-recognition receptor-signaling activity, but no change was observed in mucin expression or secretion of interleukin 6 and interleukin 8. conclusions: we identified unique species-specific immune signatures from vaginal epithelial cells elicited by colonization with commensal and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria. a. vaginae elicited a signature that is consistent with significant disruption of immune barrier properties, potentially resulting in enhanced susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections during bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == the villain team-up or how trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis alter innate immunity in concert.
AB  == objectives: complex interactions of vaginal microorganisms with the genital tract epithelium shape mucosal innate immunity, which holds the key to sexual and reproductive health. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a microbiome-disturbance syndrome  prevalent in reproductive-age women, occurs commonly in concert with trichomoniasis, and both are associated with increased risk of adverse reproductive outcomes and viral infections, largely attributable to inflammation. to investigate the causative relationships among inflammation, bv and trichomoniasis, we established a model of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells colonised by vaginal lactobacillus isolates, dominant in healthy women, and common bv species (atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia). methods: colonised epithelia were infected with trichomonas vaginalis (tv) or exposed to purified tv virulence factors (membrane lipophosphoglycan (lpg), its ceramide-phosphoinositol-glycan core (cpi-gc) or the endosymbiont trichomonas vaginalis virus (tvv)), followed by assessment of bacterial colony-forming units, the mucosal anti-inflammatory microbicide secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and chemokines that drive pro-inflammatory,  antigen-presenting and t cells. results: tv reduced colonisation by lactobacillus but not by bv species, which were found inside epithelial cells. tv increased interleukin (il)-8 and suppressed slpi, likely via lpg/cpi-gc, and upregulated il-8 and rantes, likely via tvv as suggested by use of purified pathogenic determinants. bv species a vaginae and g vaginalis induced il-8 and rantes, and also amplified the pro-inflammatory responses to both lpg/cpi-gc and tvv, whereas p bivia suppressed the tv/tvv-induced chemokines. conclusions: these molecular host-parasite-endosymbiont-bacteria interactions explain epidemiological associations and suggest a revised paradigm for restoring vaginal immunity and preventing bv/tv-attributable inflammatory sequelae in women.

TI  == longitudinal qpcr study of the dynamics of l. crispatus, l. iners, a. vaginae, (sialidase positive) g. vaginalis, and p. bivia in the vagina.
AB  == background: to obtain more detailed understanding of the causes of disturbance of the vaginal microflora (vmf), a longitudinal study was carried out for 17 women during two menstrual cycles. methods: vaginal swabs were obtained daily from 17 non-pregnant, menarchal volunteers. for each woman, gram stains were scored, the  quantitative changes of 5 key vaginal species, i.e. atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus crispatus, l. iners, (sialidase positive) gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia were quantified with qpcr and hydrogen-peroxide production was assessed on tmb+ agar. results: women could be divided in 9 subjects with predominantly normal vmf (grades ia, ib and iab, group n) and 8 with predominantly disturbed vmf (grades i-like, ii, iii and iv, group d). vmf was variable between women, but overall stable for most of the women. menses were the strongest disturbing factor of the vmf. l. crispatus was present at log7-9 cells/ml in grade ia, iab and ii vmf, but concentrations declined 100-fold during menses. l. crispatus below log7 cells/ml corresponded with poor h(2)o(2)-production. l. iners was present at log 10 cells/ml in grade ib, ii and  iii vmf. sialidase negative g. vaginalis strains (average log5 cells/ml) were detected in grade i, i-like and iv vmf. in grade ii vmf, predominantly a mixture  of both sialidase negative and positive g. vaginalis strains (average log9 cells/ml) were present, and predominantly sialidase positive strains in grade iii vmf. the presence of a. vaginae (average log9 cells/ml) coincided with grade ii and iii vmf. p. bivia (log4-8 cells/ml) was mostly present in grade iii vaginal microflora. l. iners, g. vaginalis, a. vaginae and p. bivia all increased around  menses for group n women, and as such l. iners was considered a member of disturbed vmf. conclusions: this qpcr-based study confirms largely the results of previous culture-based, microscopy-based and pyrosequencing-based studies.

TI  == novel vaginal microflora colonization model providing new insight into microbicide mechanism of action.
AB  == several broad-spectrum microbicides, including cellulose sulfate (cs), have passed conventional preclinical and phase i clinical safety evaluation and yet have failed to protect women from acquiring hiv-1 in phase ii/iii trials. concerns have been raised that current preclinical algorithms are deficient in addressing the complexity of the microflora-regulated vaginal mucosal barrier. we applied a novel microflora-colonized model to evaluate cs and hydroxyethylcellulose (hec), which is used as a "universal placebo" in microbicide trials. cervicovaginal epithelial cultures were colonized with normal vaginal microflora isolates representing common lactobacillus species used as probiotics (l. acidophilus and l. crispatus) or prevotella bivia and atopobium vaginae, most prevalent in the disturbed microflora of bacterial vaginosis (bv).  at baseline, all strains maintained constant epithelium-associated cfus without inducing cytotoxicity and apoptosis. cs selectively reduced epithelium-associated cfus and (to a lesser extent) planktonic cfus, most significantly affecting l. crispatus. inducing only minor changes in sterile epithelial cultures, cs induced expression of innate immunity mediators (rantes, interleukin-8 [il-8], and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor [slpi]) in microflora-colonized epithelia, most significantly potentiating effects of bacteria causing bv. in the absence of cs, all bacterial strains except l. acidophilus activated nf-kappab, although il-8 and rantes levels were increased by the presence of bv-causing bacteria only. cs enhanced nf-kappab activation in a dose-dependent manner under all conditions, including l. acidophilus colonization. hec remained inert. these results offer insights into possible mechanisms of cs clinical failure. the bacterially colonized cervicovaginal model reveals unique aspects of microflora-epithelium-drug interactions and innate immunity in the female genital tract and should become an integral part of preclinical safety evaluation of anti-hiv microbicides and other vaginal formulations. importance: this report provides experimental evidence supporting the concept that the vaginal microflora regulates the epithelial innate immunity in a species- and strain-specific manner and that topically applied microbicides may alter both the bacterial and epithelial components of this homeostatic interaction. our data also highlight the importance of differentiating the effects of biomedical interventions on epithelium-associated versus conventional planktonic bacterial growth when assessing vaginal mucosal health and immunity.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
