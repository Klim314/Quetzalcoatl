TI  == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects  with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than  the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI  == characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
AB  == propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of brazilian cow rumen contents in  the presence of different propolis extracts (llos), were characterized using phenotyping and 16s rrna identification. seven strains were assigned to streptococcus sp., most likely s. bovis, and were all degrading starch. one amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of selenomonas ruminantium was also found. two strains of clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. two strains were assigned to mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. one strain belonged to a bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with escherichia coli. all of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. the effect of three propolis extracts (llos b1, c1 and c3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates  of s. bovis, e. coli, m. jalaludinii and c. bifermentans. the growth of s. bovis, e. coli and m. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). c. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this llos concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. llos c3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was  a little less inhibitory than b1 and c1 on this strain.

TI  == microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of african-american children with localized aggressive periodontitis (lap). fifty-one children were included. subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (dd) and healthy sites (dh) in lap and from healthy sites in hs and hc and analyzed by 16s rrna-based microarrays. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (or = 8.3, p = 0.0025)  and abundant (p < 0.01) in dd. filifactor alocis (fa) was also found to be more prevalent in dd (or 2.31, ci 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). most prevalent species in healthy sites were selenomonas spp, veillonella spp, streptococcus spp, bergeyella sp, and kingella oralis. overall, streptococcus spp, campylobacter gracilis, capnocytophaga granulosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while aa, fa, tannerella sp, solobacterium moorei, parvimonas micra, and capnocytophaga sp were most abundant  in lap. based on a comprehensive analysis with 16s rrna-based microarrays, aa was strongly associated and site-specific in lap. in contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (clinicaltrials.gov number ct01330719). abbreviations: healthy site in healthy sibling (hs); healthy  site in healthy control child (hc).

TI  == levels of selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: to compare the levels of selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique. between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the mann-whitney u-test. results: subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, s. sputigena and the mitsuokella sp. human oral taxon (hot) 131 (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone cs002), while higher mean counts of actinomyces gerencseriae and streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). selenomonas sp. hot 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of p. gingivalis and s. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive  periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. there were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of p. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), s. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and selenomonas dianae (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone ew076) (r  = 0.42, p < 0.05). conclusion: s. sputigena and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated  further.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == correlation between composition of the bacterial community and concentration of volatile fatty acids in the rumen during the transition period and ketosis in dairy cows.
AB  == the transition period is a severe challenge to dairy cows. glucose supply cannot  meet demand and body fat is mobilized, potentially leading to negative energy balance (neb), ketosis, or fatty liver. propionate produces glucose by gluconeogenesis, which depends heavily on the number and species of microbes. in  the present study, we analyzed the rumen microbiome composition of cows in the transition period, cows with ketosis, and nonperinatal cows by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (trflp) analysis of 16s rrna genes and quantitative pcr. trflp analysis indicated that the quantity of veillonellaceae organisms was reduced and that of streptococcaceae organisms was increased in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillaceae organisms increased after calving. quantitative pcr data suggested that the numbers of the main propionate-producing microbes, megasphaera elsdenii and selenomonas ruminantium, were decreased, while numbers of the main lactate-producing bacterium, streptococcus bovis, were increased in the rumen of  cows from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillus sp. organisms increased after calving. volatile fatty acid (vfa) and glucose concentrations were decreased, but the lactic acid concentration was  increased, in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups. our results indicate that the vfa concentration is significantly related to the numbers of selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii organisms in the rumen.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == microbiological diversity of generalized aggressive periodontitis by 16s rrna clonal analysis.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in the subgingival plaque of subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis by using culture-independent molecular methods based on 16s ribosomal dna cloning. methods: samples from 10 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were selected. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified with the universal primer pairs 9f and 1525r. amplified genes were  cloned, sequenced, and identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. results: one hundred and ten species were identified from 10 subjects and 1007 clones were sequenced. of these, 70 species were most prevalent. fifty-seven percent of the clone (40 taxa) sequences represented phylotypes for which no cultivated isolates have been reported. several species of selenomonas and streptococcus were found at high prevalence and proportion in all subjects. overall, 50% of the clone libraries were formed by these two genera. selenomonas  sputigena, the species most commonly detected, was found in nine of 10 subjects.  other species of selenomonas were often present at high levels, including s. noxia, selenomonas sp. ew084, selenomonas sp. ew076, selenomonas ft050, selenomonas sp. p2pa_80, and selenomonas sp. strain gaa14. the classical putative periodontal pathogens, such as, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, was below  the limit of detection and was not detected. conclusion: these data suggest that  other species, notably species of selenomonas, may be associated with disease in  generalized aggressive periodontitis subjects.

TI  == survey of urease activity in ruminal bacteria isolated from domestic and wild ruminants.
AB  == a total of 909 strains, including selenomonas ruminantium, lactobacillus sp., enterococcus sp. and staphylococcus sp., from the rumen of 104 domestic and wild  ruminants was used in tests for urease activity. tests showed that 56.7% of s. ruminantium strains and 18.5% of lactobacilli manifested medium urease activity with mean values of 14.4 +/- 2.5 and 13.85 +/- 0.25 nkat ml-1, respectively. most of the enterococcus faecium (62.2%) and all of the e. faecalis isolates expressed urease activity with mean values of 3.9 +/- 0.05 and 4.1 +/- 0.06 nkat ml-1. e. malodoratus, e. solitarius, e. mundtii, streptococcus bovis and s. uberis did not produce any urease. all the staphylococci screened were urease-producing strains, mostly with medium or low urease activity. the highest level of urease was measured in the rumen epithelial wall of isolates se30 (19.7 +/- 2.71 nkat ml-1 of rumen content), scu32 (29.3 +/- 1.6 nkat ml-1) and also in the rumen content isolates ef35 (19.9 +/- 0.94 nkat ml-1) and s. ruminantium 77 (25.35 nkat ml-1).  this survey contributes new data to existing information relating to the ureolytic microbial ecosystem in ruminants.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on simulated development of ruminal lactic acidosis in vitro.
AB  == a continuous coculture of four ruminal bacteria, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, and lactobacillus sp. strain lb17,  was used to study the effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on the changes in ruminal microbial ecology that occur during the onset of lactic acidosis. in control incubations, the system simulated the development of lactic  acidosis in vivo, with an initial overgrowth of s. bovis when an excess of glucose was added to the fermentor. lactobacillus sp. strain lb17 subsequently became dominant as ph fell and lactate concentration rose. both ionophores were able to prevent the accumulation of lactic acid and maintain a healthy non-lactate-producing bacterial population when added at the same time as an excess of glucose. tetronasin was more potent in this respect than monensin. when tetronasin was added to the culture 24 h after glucose, the proliferation of lactobacilli was reversed and a non-lactate-producing bacterial population developed, with an associated drop in lactate concentration in the fermentor. rises in culture ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations accompanied these changes. monensin was unable to suppress the growth of lactobacilli; therefore, in contrast to tetronasin, monensin added 24 h after the addition of glucose failed to reverse the acidosis. numbers of lactobacilli and lactate concentrations remained high, whereas ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations were low.

TI  == susceptibility and resistance of ruminal bacteria to antimicrobial feed additives.
AB  == susceptibility and resistance of ruminal bacterial species to avoparcin, narasin, salinomycin, thiopeptin, tylosin, virginiamycin, and two new ionophore antibiotics, ro22-6924/004 and ro21-6447/009, were determined. generally, antimicrobial compounds were inhibitory to gram-positive bacteria and those bacteria that have gram-positive-like cell wall structure. mics ranged from 0.09  to 24.0 micrograms/ml. gram-negative bacteria were resistant at the highest concentration tested (48.0 micrograms/ml). on the basis of their fermentation products, ruminal bacteria that produce lactic acid, butyric acid, formic acid, or hydrogen were susceptible and bacteria that produce succinic acid or ferment lactic acid were resistant to the antimicrobial compounds. selenomonas ruminantium was the only major lactic acid-producing bacteria resistant to all the antimicrobial compounds tested. avoparcin and tylosin appeared to be less inhibitory (mic greater than 6.0 micrograms/ml) than the other compounds to the two major lactic acid-producing bacteria, streptococcus bovis and lactobacillus sp. ionophore compounds seemed to be more inhibitory (mic, 0.09 to 1.50 micrograms/ml) than nonionophore compounds (mic, 0.75 to 12.0 micrograms/ml) to the major butyric acid-producing bacteria. treponema bryantii, an anaerobic rumen spirochete, was less sensitive to virginiamycin than to the other antimicrobial compounds. ionophore compounds were generally bacteriostatic, and nonionophore compounds were bactericidal. the specific growth rate of bacteroides ruminicola was reduced by all the antimicrobial compounds except avoparcin. the antibacterial spectra of the feed additives were remarkably similar, and it appears that mics may not be good indicators of the potency of the compounds in altering ruminal fermentation characteristics.

TI  == isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  == one hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a  hay-grain ration. before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings  were counted. calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of  attached bacteria also occurred. nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. most of these types were represented among the isolates. characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed  that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), bacteroides sp. (22.4%), selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), streptococcus bovis (8.1%), propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), treponema sp. (3.1%), and eubacterium sp., lachnospira multiparus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5%  each). eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. l. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. all s. bovis strains and two strains each of bacteroides sp. and butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (r. j. wallace, k.-j. cheng, d. dinsdale, and e. r. orskov, nature (london) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. the term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.
