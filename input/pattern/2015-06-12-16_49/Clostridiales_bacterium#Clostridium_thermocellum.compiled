TI  - Microbial community structure of a pilot-scale thermophilic anaerobic digester treating poultry litter.
AB  - The microbial community structure of a stable pilot-scale thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactor digester stabilized on poultry litter was investigated. This 40-m(3) digester produced biogas with 57% methane, and chemical oxygen demand removal of 54%. Bacterial and archaeal diversity were examined using both cloning and pyrosequencing that targeted 16S rRNA genes. The bacterial community was dominated by phylum Firmicutes, constituting 93% of the clones and 76% of the pyrotags. Of the Firmicutes, class Clostridia (52% pyrotags) was most abundant followed by class Bacilli (13% pyrotags). The bacterial libraries identified 94 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and pyrosequencing identified 577 OTUs at the 97% minimum similarity level. Fifteen OTUs were dominant (>/=2% abundance), and nine of these were novel unclassified Firmicutes. Several of the dominant OTUs could not be classified more specifically than Clostridiales, but were most similar to plant biomass degraders, including Clostridium thermocellum. Of the rare pyrotag OTUs (<0.5% abundance), 75% were Firmicutes. The dominant methanogen was Methanothermobacter which has hydrogenotrophic metabolism, and accounted for >99% of the archaeal clones. Based on the primary methanogen, as well as digester chemistry (high VA and ammonia levels), we propose that bacterial acetate oxidation is the primary pathway in this digester for the control of acetate levels.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a new Clostridium sp. that performs effective cellulosic waste digestion in a thermophilic methanogenic bioreactor.
AB  - A methanogenic bioreactor that utilized wastepaper was developed and operated at  55 degrees C. Microbial community structure analysis showed the presence of a group of clostridia that specifically occurred during the period of high fermentation efficiency. To isolate the effective cellulose digester, the sludge that exhibited high fermentation efficiency was inoculated into a synthetic medium that contained cellulose powder as the sole carbon source and was successively cultivated. A comprehensive 16S rRNA gene sequencing study revealed that the enriched culture contained various clostridia that had diverse phylogenetic positions. The microorganisms were further enriched by successive cultivation with filter paper as the substrate, as well as the bait carrier. A resultant isolate, strain EBR45 (= Clostridium sp. strain NBRC101661), was a new member of the order Clostridiales phylogenetically and physiologically related to Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium straminisolvens. Specific PCR-based monitoring demonstrated that strain EBR45 specifically occurred during the high fermentation efficiency period in the original methanogenic sludge. Strain EBR45 effectively digested office paper in its pure cultivation system with a synthetic medium.
