lactobacillus rhamnosus l34 and lactobacillus casei l39 suppress clostridium difficile-induced il-8 production by colonic epithelial cells.
background: clostridium difficile is the main cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea and colitis known as c. difficile-associated disease (cdad).with increased severity and failure of treatment in cdad, new approaches for prevention and treatment, such as the use of probiotics, are needed. since the pathogenesis of cdad involves an inflammatory response with a massive influx of neutrophils recruited by interleukin (il)-8, this study aimed to investigate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus spp. on the suppression of il-8 production in response to c. difficile infection. results: we screened lactobacillus conditioned media from 34 infant fecal isolates for the ability to suppress c. difficile-induced il-8 production from ht-29 cells. factors produced by two vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli, l. rhamnosus l34 (lr-l34) and l.casei l39 (lc-l39), suppressed the secretion and transcription of il-8 without inhibiting c. difficile viability or toxin production. conditioned media from lr-l34 suppressed the activation of phospho-nf-kappab with no effect on phospho-c-jun. however, lc-l39 conditioned media suppressed the activation of both phospho-nf-kappab and phospho-c-jun. conditioned media from lr-l34 and lc-l39 also decreased the production of c. difficile-induced gm-csf in ht-29 cells. immunomodulatory factors present in the conditioned media of both lr-l34 and lc-l39 are heat-stable up to 100 degrees c and > 100 kda in size. conclusions: our results suggest that l. rhamnosus l34 and l. casei l39 each produce factors capable of modulating inflammation stimulated by c. difficile. these vancomycin-resistant lactobacillus strains are potential probiotics for treating or preventing cdad.
[outcomes of clostridium difficile enterocolitis after administration of antibiotics along with probiotic supplement].
introduction: clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a potentially fatal disease  showing increasing incidence in hospital environment. therapeutic approach in the management of clostridium difficile enterocolitis is highly complex, particularly because of its tendency to relapse and reinfection. the study was aimed at investigating the factors influencing the development of clostridium difficile enterocolitis and outcomes of enterocolitis after administration of standard antimicrobial therapy combined with probiotic supplement. material and methods: a non-comparative prospective observational study encompassed 42 patients (22 males and 20 females) diagnosed with clostridium difficile enterocolitis and treated at the department of infectious diseases in novi sad in the period october 2011 - april 2012. results: higher incidence of the disease was found in elderly patients (78.6% of them were over 60 years of age), after antimicrobial therapy (83.8%), after hospitalization (83.3%) and in comorbid conditions (85.7%). the clinical picture revealed predominantly mild to moderate symptoms. a good clinical response to the standard antimicrobial therapy (metronidazole, vancomycin) combined with probiotic given for 10 days was observed in all patients, and the improvement in parameters such as the number and appearance of stools, abdominal distension and pain was recorded. statistically significant changes in laboratory parameters (leukocyte count, c-reactive protein level) were recorded on day 5 after the onset of disease. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in 9.5% of the patients. conclusion: administration of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11 and bifidobacterium longum rosell-175 alongside the standard antimicrobial therapy in the patients with clostridium difficile enterocolitis demonstrated positive effects on the severity or clinical picture and normalization of laboratory parameters. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in only a small number of patients as compared with the literature data.
in vitro inhibition of clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens by commercial probiotic strains.
probiotics have gained importance in human and veterinary medicine to prevent and control clostridial enteric disease. limited information is available on the ability of different probiotic bacteria used in food products to inhibit clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens. the objective of this study was to examine the in vitro inhibitory effects of selected commercial bacterial strains on pathogenic clostridia and their growth characteristics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. the inhibitory effects of 17 commercial strains of lactobacillus (n = 16) and bifidobacterium (n = 1) on the reference strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens were assessed by an agar well diffusion assay and by a broth culture inhibition assay using cell-free supernatant harvested at different growth phases, with and without ph neutralization. to study growth characteristics, probiotic strains were cultivated in different acid and bile environments, and growth in the modified media was compared to growth in standard medium. in the agar well diffusion assay, supernatant obtained from two probiotic strains inhibited the growth of both reference and clinical strains of c. perfringens. this effect as seen when supernatant was assessed with and without ph neutralization. supernatants obtained from 10 probiotic strains inhibited c. difficile only when supernatant was added without ph neutralization. in the broth culture inhibition assay, growth of c. perfringens and c. difficile was inhibited by supernatant without ph neutralization from 5 and 10 probiotic strains, respectively. all potential probiotic strains were able to grow at ph 4.0 and in the presence of 0.15% and 0.3% bile but none were able to grow or survive at ph 2.0. altogether five probiotic strains [lactobacillus plantarum (n = 2), lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 2), bifidobacterium animalis lactis (n = 1)] were shown to inhibit all strains of c. difficile and c. perfringens. the inhibitory effect was probiotic strain-specific. two strains showed a ph-independent inhibitory effect likely due to production of either antibiotics or bacteriocins inhibiting c. perfringens only. these strains have favourable growth characteristics for use as probiotics and their efficacy as prophylactic or therapeutic measures against clostridial enteric disease should be further evaluated by clinical trials in animals.
[assessment of antagonistic activity in vitro lactobacillus spp. strains againts  clostridum difficile strains isolated from gastrointestinal tract of patients hospitalized in three hospitals in region mazovia].
introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonistic activity of  lactobacillus strains against clinical c. difficile strains isolated from faecal samples of adults patients with diarrhea. a total 61 strains of c. difficile randomly selected isolated in the period 2007-2008 from the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients in three hospitals province mazovia, poland. to determination of antagonistic activity ofprobiotic lactobacillus spp. strains used four reference strains: lactobacillus plantarum 2017405, lactobacillus fermentum 353, lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 21007 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. methods: isolation of c. difficile was performed on selective columbia agar supplemented with cycloserine/cefoxitine and amphothericin b (clo medium, biomerieux, france). the plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 48 h at 37 degrees c. isolates were identified as c. difficile by the characteristic morphology of the colonies and horse-like odour, green yellow fluorescence under uv. toxigenicity of of c. difficile strains was determined in pcr to detection of fragments of genes encoding toxin a (tcda), toxin b (tcdb) and binary toxin (cdta and cdtb). the study of antagonistic activity four lactobacillus spp. strains against 61 clinical c. difficile strains was performed according to standard methods. lactobacillus strains were inoculated on mrs medium and incubated in oxygen-free atmosphere and cut the bars of mrs agar and applied to the plate with cultures of c. difficile strains. results: assessment of antagonist activity of lactobacillus spp. strains was performed by measuring the zone of inhibition of grown of c. difficile strains. the study shows that of probiotic lactobacillus spp. strains interacted antagonistically in vitro against all toxigenic (a+b+cdt- and a+b+cdt+) of c. difficile strains. conclusions: the differences in the antagonistic activity of lactobacillus spp. strains against different toxigenic clinical c. difficile strains were not observed.
early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
