cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of the lactobacillus helveticus 481  gene encoding the bacteriocin helveticin j.
lactobacillus helveticus 481 produces a 37-kda bacteriocin called helveticin j. libraries of chromosomal dna from l. helveticus were prepared in lambda gt11 and probed for phage-producing fusion proteins that could react with polyclonal helveticin j antibody. two recombinant phage, hj1 and hj4, containing homologous inserts of 350 and 600 bp, respectively, produced proteins that reacted with antibody. these two phage clones specifically hybridized to l. helveticus 481 total genomic dna but not to dna from strains that did not produce helveticin j or strains producing unrelated bacteriocins. hj1 and hj4 lysogens produced beta-galactosidase fusion proteins that shared similar epitopes with each other and helveticin j. the intact helveticin j gene (hlv) was isolated by screening a library of l. helveticus chromosomal dna in lambda embl3 with the insert dna from phage hj4 as a probe. the dna sequence of a contiguous 3,364-bp region was determined. two complete open reading frames (orf), designated orf2 and orf3, were identified within the sequenced fragment. the 3' end of another open reading frame, orf1, was located upstream of orf2. a noncoding region and a putative promoter were located between orf1 and orf2. orf2 could encode an 11,808-da protein. the l. helveticus dna inserts of the hj1 and hj4 clones reside within orf3, which begins 30 bp downstream from the termination codon of orf2. orf3 could encode a 37,511-da protein. downstream from orf3, the 5' end of another orf (orf4) was found. a bg/ii fragment containing orf2 and orf3 was cloned into pgk12, and the recombinant plasmid, ptrk135, was transformed into lactobacillus acidophilus via electroporation. transformants carrying ptrk135 produced a bacteriocin that was heat labile and exhibited an acitivity spectrum that was the same as that of helveticin j.
conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded determinants for bacteriocin production and  immunity in lactobacillus acidophilus 88.
lactobacillus acidophilus 88 produced a bacteriocin, designated lactacin f, that  demonstrated inhibitory activity toward l. acidophilus 6032, l. lactis 970, l. helveticus 87, l. bulgaricus 1489, l. leichmanii 4797, l. fermentum 1750, and streptococcus faecalis 19433. production of lactacin f was ph dependent and could be maximized in mrs broth cultures maintained at ph 7.0. lactacin f was heat stable and sensitive to ficin, proteinase k, trypsin, and bacillus subtilis protease. l. acidophilus 88 harbored plasmids of 4 and 27 megadaltons. variants of l. acidophilus 88 which were deficient in lactacin f production (laf) and lactacin f immunity (laf) retained the two resident plasmids. a laf laf derivative, l. acidophilus 89, was used as a recipient in agar surface mating experiments with l. acidophilus 88 (laf laf). two types of laf laf transconjugants were recovered. one type (t-e) had acquired two plasmids of 68 (ppm68) and 52 (ppm52) megadaltons that were not detected in either the conjugal donor or the other type of laf laf transconjugants (t-89). laf and laf were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. plasmid analysis of laf laf variants revealed that ppm52 and ppm68 were cured with loss of laf and laf. bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in laf laf transconjugants not harboring ppm52 and ppm68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants. the data demonstrated intragenic conjugation in l. acidophilus and provided direct evidence for involvement of transient plasmid determinants in laf and laf.
purification and characterization of the lactobacillus acidophilus bacteriocin lactacin b.
parameters for production and purification of a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus n2 are described. production of lactacin b was ph dependent, with maximum activity detected in broth cultures maintained at ph 6. lactacin b was purified by ion-exchange chromatography, ultrafiltration, and successive gel filtrations in the presence of 8 m urea and then 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. the molecular weight of lactacin b was ca. 6,000 to 6,500, and the purified compound showed maximum absorbance at 211 nm. the activity of purified lactacin b was bactericidal to sensitive cells and restricted to members of the family lactobacilliaceae, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, and l. lactis. characteristics identified for lactacin b indicated that it was a peptide and confirmed its identity as a bacteriocin.
detection and activity of lactacin b, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus.
a total of 52 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus were examined for production of bacteriocins. a majority (63%) demonstrated inhibitory activity against all members of a four-species grouping of lactobacillus leichmannii, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus lactis. four l. acidophilus strains with this activity also inhibited streptococcus faecalis and lactobacillus fermentum, suggesting a second system of antagonism. under conditions eliminating the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, no inhibition of other gram-positive or -negative genera was demonstrated by l. acidophilus. the agent produced by l. acidophilus n2 and responsible for inhibition of l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, and l. lactis was investigated. ultrafiltration studies indicated a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 for the crude inhibitor. the agent was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 60 min at 100 degrees c (ph 5). activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. these characteristics identified the inhibitory agent as a bacteriocin, designated lactacin b. examination of strains of l. acidophilus within the six homology groupings of johnson et al. (int. j. syst. bacteriol. 30:53-68, 1980) demonstrated that production of the bacteriocin lactacin b could not be used in classification of neotype l. acidophilus strains. however, the usefulness of employing sensitivity to lactacin b in classification of dairy lactobacilli is suggested.
