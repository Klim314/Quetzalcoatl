TI  - Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 suppresses fatty acid release through enlargement of fat emulsion size in vitro and promotes fecal fat excretion in healthy Japanese subjects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 (LG2055) has been shown to prevent abdominal adiposity, and suppression of lipid absorption is considered a possible mechanism, detail of which, however, are poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of LG2055 on fat hydrolysis by determining pancreatic lipase activity and fat emulsion properties in vitro. We also examined whether LG2055 influences fecal fat excretion in humans. METHODS: Pancreatic lipase activity was investigated in vitro using an artificially prepared fat emulsion and 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate (4-MUO) as substrates. The concentrations of free fatty acids and 4-methylumbelliferone were quantified. Fat emulsion droplet size was measured using a particle size analyzer. The clinical study was performed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects consumed 100 g of fermented milk (FM)/d, either with or without LG2055 supplementation, for seven days. Fecal samples were collected during three-day pre-observational and FM intake periods and fecal fat levels were determined. RESULTS: LG2055 dose-dependently suppressed lipase activity in the fat emulsion assay but not in the 4-MUO assay. LG2055 dose-dependently increased fat emulsion droplet size. The effects of LG2055 on lipase activity and fat emulsion properties were increased compared with four other tested strains (Lactobacillus gasseri SBT0317, Lactobacillus gasseri JCM1131T, Lactobacillus. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus JCM1002T and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258T). In our clinical study, fecal fat level after FM intake was significantly increased compared with that observed before FM intake in the LG2055-containing active FM group but not the control FM group lacking LG2055. CONCLUSIONS: LG2055 increased fat emulsion droplet size, resulting in the suppression of lipase-mediated fat hydrolysis. The influence of LG2055 on the physicochemical properties of fat emulsion provides a mechanism for the probiotic-mediated suppression of lipid absorption and promotion of fecal fat excretion in humans.

TI  - [Beneficial effects of consumption of a dairy product containing two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711 and Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714 in healthy children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the last decades there has been an increasing interest in the manipulation of intestinal microbiota with probiotics for the prevention and treatment of certain paediatric diseases. In addition, it has been suggested that probiotics could play a role in the development of immune system. Recent studies suggest that the administration of two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711 and Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714 improves intestinal function of healthy adults and enhances the immune response. Since there are few studies reporting the use of probiotic in children, the main consumers of these products, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of the administration of the mentioned probiotic strains in healthy children. INTERVENTIONS: 30 children (age range 3-12) with no gastrointestinal pathology were included in the study. In addition to their usual diet, during the first 3 weeks they received 200 ml of a conventional yogurt containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. During the following three weeks this yogurt was substi-tuted for 80 ml of a probiotic product (Max Defensas, Puleva Food S.L.) containing the same amounts of Streptococcus thermophilus and the L. bulgaricus was substituted by a mixture of the target probiotic strains: L. coryniformis CECT5711 and L. gasseri CECT5714. Samples of faeces and saliva were taken at the beginning of the protocol, at week 3 and at the end of the study. Intestinal microbiota, faecal citotoxicity and the inhibition of Salmonella cholerasusis ssp. cholerasuis adhesion to intestinal mucins by the faeces were analyzed. Finally, IgA concentration was determined in the faecal and saliva samples. RESULTS: Tolerance of the probiotic product was good in all the children included in the study. An increase in faecal lactobacilli counts was shown at the end of the experimental protocol (P < 0,05). In addition citotoxicity of faecal samples was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after probiotic consumption. The inhibition of S. cholerasuis adhesion to intestinal mucins was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for faecal waters from children in week 6 compared to samples form week 0 and 3. Probiotic consumption was also shown to increase IgA concentration in faeces and saliva (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of a probiotic product containing L. coryniformis CECT5711 and L. gasseri CECT5714 improves intestinal flora of healthy children, enhancing the defence against gastrointestinal aggressions and infections both by inhibiting pathogen adhesion to intestinal mucins and enhancing the immune function.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of Lactobacillus gasseri expressing manganese superoxide dismutase using the interleukin 10-deficient mouse model of colitis.
AB  - Emerging evidence has implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although intestinal epithelial cells produce the ROS-neutralizing enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), the protein and activity levels of copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) and manganese (Mn) SOD are perturbed in inflamed tissues of IBD patients. Thus we investigated the ability of MnSOD from Streptococcus thermophilus to reduce colitis symptoms in interleukin (IL) 10-deficient mice using Lactobacillus gasseri as a delivery vehicle. Cohorts of 13-15 IL-10-deficient mice were left untreated or supplemented with native L. gasseri or L. gasseri expressing MnSOD for 4 wk. Colonic tissue was collected and inflammation was histologically scored. The presence of innate immune cells was investigated by immunohistochemistry and the host antioxidant response was determined by quantitative PCR. It was demonstrated that L. gasseri was stably maintained in mice for at least 3 days. L. gasseri producing MnSOD significantly reduced inflammation in IL-10-deficient mice compared with untreated controls (P < 0.05), whereas the anti-inflammatory effects of both native and MnSOD producing L. gasseri were more pronounced in males. The anti-inflammatory effects of L. gasseri were associated with a reduction in the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. Transcripts of antioxidant genes were equivalent in colonic tissues obtained from control and probiotic-treated IL-10-deficient mice. This study demonstrates that L. gasseri producing MnSOD has significant anti-inflammatory activity that reduces the severity of colitis in the IL-10-deficient mouse.
TI  - Marker-free chromosomal integration of the manganese superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) from Streptococcus thermophilus into Lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  - A strategy for functional gene replacement in the chromosome of Lactobacillus gasseri is described. The phospho-beta-galactosidase II gene (lacII) was functionally replaced by the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene (sodA) from Streptococcus thermophilus, by adapting the insertional inactivation method described for lactobacilli [Russell, W.M. and Klaenhammer, T.R. 2001 Efficient system for directed integration into the Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri chromosomes via homologous recombination. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67, 4361-4364]. L. gasseri carrying the heterologous sodA gene grew on lactose as efficiently as the wild-type parent. An active MnSOD was expressed in the transgenic strain, and the enzyme migrated on PAGE-SOD activity gels to the same position as that of MnSOD from S. thermophilus. The expression of MnSOD from a single copy of sodA integrated in the chromosome of L. gasseri provided enhanced tolerance to hydrogen peroxide, and extended the viability of carbon/energy starved cultures stored at 25 degrees C. This is the first report showing the successful utilization of the pORI plasmids system to generate marker-free gene integration in L. gasseri strains.
TI  - Expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  - In living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. A widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutases (SODs) and hydroperoxidases. Generally, these enzymes are not present in Lactobacillus spp. In this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous SOD to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. Thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing SOD (sodA) was cloned from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. A 1.2-kb PCR product containing the sodA gene was cloned into the shuttle vector pTRK563, to yield pSodA, which was functionally expressed and complemented an Escherichia coli strain deficient in Mn and FeSODs. The plasmid, pSodA, was subsequently introduced and expressed in Lactobacillus gasseri NCK334, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCK89, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCK56, and Lactobacillus reuteri NCK932. Molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the gene (sodA) and the expression of an active gene product (MnSOD) in these strains of lactobacilli. The specific activities of MnSOD were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 U/mg of protein for L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. reuteri, respectively. The expression of S. thermophilus MnSOD in L. gasseri and L. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. The data show that MnSOD protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing O(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of a sodA from S. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the late gene cluster from Lactobacillus phages.
AB  - Three prophage sequences were identified in the Lactobacillus johnsoni strain NCC533. Prophage Lj965 predicted a gene map very similar to those of pac-site Streptococcus thermophilus phages over its DNA packaging and head and tail morphogenesis modules. Sequence similarity linked the putative DNA packaging and head morphogenesis genes at the protein level. Prophage Lj965/S. thermophilus phage Sfi11/Lactococcus lactis phage TP901-1 on one hand and Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage LL-H/Lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e/Listeria monocytogenes phage A118 on the other hand defined two sublines of structural gene clusters in pac-site Siphoviridae from low-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 linked both sublines. The putative major head and tail proteins from Lj965 shared weak sequence similarity with phages from Gram-negative bacteria. A clearly independent line of structural genes in Siphoviridae from low-GC Gram-positive bacteria is defined by temperate cos-site phages including Lactobacillus gasseri phage adh, which also shared sequence similarity with phage D3 infecting a Gram-negative bacterium. A phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the ClpP-like protein identified in four cos-site Siphoviridae from Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas showed graded sequence relationships. The tree suggested that the ClpP-like proteins from the phages were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from their corresponding bacterial hosts.
TI  - Proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. Based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. Specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. gasseri, L. helveticus, L. reuteri, and Streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (NO) production were examined in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. A similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and Peyer's patch cells. Both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) IL-6, and NO. Pronounced enhancement of IL-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and Peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. Based on the results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and NO, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.
TI  - Lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. We have studied the potential of Lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), Lactobacillus gasseri (P79), Lactobacillus confusus (DSM20196), Streptococcus thermophilus (NCIM 50083), Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of DNA damage by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of the rat. Using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward MNNG after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. One-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. High doses of heat-treated L. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. One mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. Accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. Metabolically active L. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented MNNG-induced DNA damage. Different cell fractions from L. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. As a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) was used. A dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of DMH in several segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg DMH/kg body wt p.o. induced DNA damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. Pretreatment orally with LAB on four consecutive mornings before DMH gavage (8 hours after the last LAB application) revealed that L. acidophilus, L. confusus, L. gasseri, B. longum, and B. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of DMH. One of four S. thermophilus and one of three Lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. Heat-treated L. acidophilus did not inhibit DMH-induced genotoxicity. A few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (PCNA). DMH treatment did not increase PCNA, nor was there any modulation by LAB. The effect of L. acidophilus on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (Phase I and Phase II) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. The meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by LAB, remains unclear. In conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, LAB tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the GI tract of the rat and that viable LAB organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. The comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.
TI  - Survival of yogurt-containing organisms and Lactobacillus gasseri (ADH) and their effect on bacterial enzyme activity in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy and hypochlorhydric elderly subjects.
AB  - The effect of the live bacterial yogurt cultures, namely Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and a mucosal adhering strain of Lactobacillus gasseri (ADH) on small intestinal and fecal bacterial characteristics was examined in 10 elderly subjects with atrophic gastritis and 23 elderly normal volunteers (11 received yogurt and 12 received ADH). Neither S thermophilus nor L bulgaricus was recovered from the stomach or small intestine of subjects fed yogurt or pasteurized yogurt. ADH was recovered from gastric or small intestinal aspirates in three of four subjects and in the stools of four of five subjects diagnosed with atrophic gastritis. In 11 of 12 normal subjects, ADH was isolated from stools. There was a significant reduction in fecal bacterial enzyme activity in both normal volunteers and subjects with atrophic gastritis after being fed with viable ADH. Adherent strains of bacteria such as ADH are likely to survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract and thus have greater metabolic effects.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
