TI  == etiologic agents and diseases found associated with clinical aspergillosis in falcons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to describe parasitological, microbiological, and pathological findings associated with the isolation of aspergillus species in 94  clinically diseased captive falcons from dubai. concomitant agents and/or diseases were identified in 64 cases, causing either single (n = 36) or multiple  coinfections (n = 28). diagnoses found more often in association with aspergillosis were chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (cfids) (n = 29), caryospora sp. (n = 16), serratospiculum seurati infestation (n = 14), cestodiasis (n = 6), bumblefoot (n = 5), trematodosis due to strigea falconispalumbi (n = 5), trichomoniasis (n = 4), babesia shortti (n = 4), mannheimia (pastorella) haemolytica (n = 4), interstitial hepatitis (n = 4), escherichia coli (n = 3), and clostridium perfringens enterotoxemia (n = 2). compared with a control group of 2000 diseased falcons without evidence of aspergillosis, the prevalence of babesia shortti, cfids, mannheimia (pastorella)  haemolytica, escherichia coli, and falcon herpes virus infection was conspicuously higher in association with aspergillosis. these entities may be considered suitable candidates as predisposing factors for the mycosis.

TI  == clinical mastitis in ewes; bacteriology, epidemiology and clinical features.
AB  == background: clinical mastitis is an important disease in sheep. the objective of  this work was to identify causal bacteria and study certain epidemiological and clinical features of clinical mastitis in ewes kept for meat and wool production. methods: the study included 509 ewes with clinical mastitis from 353 flocks located in 14 of the 19 counties in norway. clinical examination and collection of udder secretions were carried out by veterinarians. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was performed on 92 staphylococcus aureus isolates from 64 ewes. results and conclusion: s. aureus was recovered from 65.3% of 547 clinically affected mammary glands, coagulase-negative staphylococci from 2.9%, enterobacteria, mainly escherichia coli, from 7.3%, streptococcus spp. from 4.6%, mannheimia haemolytica from 1.8% and various other bacteria from 4.9%, while no bacteria were cultured from 13.2% of the samples. forty percent of the ewes with  unilateral clinical s. aureus mastitis also had a subclinical s. aureus infection in the other mammary gland. twenty-four of 28 (86%) pairs of s. aureus isolates obtained from clinically and subclinically affected mammary glands of the same ewe were indistinguishable by pfge. the number of identical pairs was significantly greater than expected, based on the distribution of different s. aureus types within the flocks. one-third of the cases occurred during the first  week after lambing, while a second peak was observed in the third week of lactation. gangrene was present in 8.8% of the clinically affected glands; s. aureus was recovered from 72.9%, clostridium perfringens from 6.3% and e. coli from 6.3% of the secretions from such glands. this study shows that s. aureus predominates as a cause of clinical ovine mastitis in norway, also in very severe cases. results also indicate that s. aureus is frequently spread between udder halves of infected ewes.

TI  == a retrospective study of mortality in pennsylvania captive white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus): 20000--2003.
AB  == the postmortem records of 160 white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) submitted for necropsy examination from 59 separate pennsylvania captive deer farms over a 3.5-year period were reviewed to determine the primary cause of death of each animal. the most common causes of death were bronchopneumonia (39 cases), enterocolitis (30 cases), malnutrition (13 cases), and trauma (11 cases). other causes of mortality included severe gastrointestinal parasitism (6 cases),  cellulitis with septicemia (5 cases), degenerative myopathy (4 cases), ruminal acidosis (4 cases), and nephritis (4 cases). the cause of death was undetermined  in 13 of the 160 animals. arcanobacterium pyogenes (19 cases), fusobacterium necrophorum (10 cases), escherichia coli (7 cases), and mannheimia haemolytica (4 cases) were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the pneumonic lungs. bacterial agents associated with enterocolitis included clostridium perfringens (15 cases), e. coli (12 cases), and mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (2 cases). the majority (52.2%) of the death loss in white-tailed deer of known ages occurred in animals 1 year of age or less, with 46.2% of the bronchopneumonia cases and 50.0% of the enterocolitis cases occurring during this time period. cases of degenerative myopathy, myocardial degeneration, hepatic necrosis, meningoencephalitis, peritonitis, and urolithiasis considered severe enough to be the primary cause of death appeared early in life, affecting deer 6  months of age or less in all cases. in conclusion, bronchopneumonia, enterocolitis, malnutrition, and trauma were considered the most common causes of death in confined white-tailed deer in this study.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
