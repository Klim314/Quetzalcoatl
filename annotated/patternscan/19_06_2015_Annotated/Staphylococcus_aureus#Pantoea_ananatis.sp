TI  == sunlight-induced rapid and efficient biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of linn. with enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  == background: nanotechnology is now regarded as a distinct field of research in modern science and technology with multifaceted areas including biomedical applications. among the various approaches currently available for the generation of metallic nanoparticles, biogenic synthesis is of increasing demand for the purpose of green nanotechnology. among various natural sources, plant materials are the most readily available template-directing matrix offering cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and easy handling. moreover, the inherent pharmacological potentials of these medicinal plant extracts offer added biomedical implementations of the synthesized metal nanoparticles. results: a robust practical method for eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles using  aqueous leaf extract of ocimum sanctum (tulsi) as both reducing and capping agent, under the influence of direct sunlight has been developed without applying any other chemical additives. the nanoparticles were characterized with the help  of uv-visible spectrophotometer and transmission electron microscopy (tem). the prepared silver nanoparticles exhibited considerable antibacterial activity. the  effects were more pronounced on non-endospore-forming gram-positive bacteria viz., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes than endospore-forming species bacillus subtilis. the nanoparticles also showed prominent activity on gram-negative human pathogenic salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and plant pathogenic pantoea ananatis. a bactericidal mode of action was observed for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by the nanoparticles. conclusions: we have developed a very simple, efficient, and practical method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of o. sanctum under the influence of direct sunlight. the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles making use of such a traditionally important medicinal plant without applying any other chemical additives, thus offers a cost-effective and environmentally benign route for their large-scale commercial production. the nanoparticles dispersed in the mother solution showed promising antibacterial efficacy. graphical abstractsunlight-induced rapid and efficient biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of ocimum sanctum linn. with enhanced antibacterial activity.

TI  == a new pentacyclic triterpene with potent antibacterial activity from limnophila indica linn. (druce).
AB  == a new pentacyclic triterpenoid constituent, characterized as 3-oxo-olean-12(13),18(19)-dien-29alpha-carboxylic acid (1) on the basis of detailed spectral studies, was isolated from the aerial parts and roots of limnophila indica (scrophulariaceae). compound 1 exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against three gram-positive bacteria viz. bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes (mics within a range of 25-30 mug/ml) and moderate activity against four gram-negative bacteria salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pantoea ananatis (mics within a range of 30-100 mug/ml). the plant pathogenic bacterium p. ananatis and human pathogenic s. typhimurium responded at comparatively higher concentrations of the compound 1, which were 75 and 100 mug/ml respectively. the  compound inhibited the growth of gram-positive b. subtilis and gram-negative p. aeruginosa completely with a clear bactericidal mode of action at their mic values. the compound upon treatment on both b. subtilis and p. aeruginosa released substantial amount of nucleic acid in the external medium and also effected the change of morphology towards pleomorphicity, thereby indicating its  probable action on cell membrane. furthermore, the triterpenoid 1 was found not to inhibit a probiotic lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis labw4 under in vitro condition and to possess no toxicity in swiss albino mice.

TI  == absolute configuration and antimicrobial activity of acylhomoserine lactones.
AB  == (s)-n-heptanoylhomoserine lactone is an uncommon acyl odd-chain natural product employed by many gram-negative bacteria as a signaling substance in chemical communication mechanisms known as quorum sensing. the absolute configuration determination of the metabolite produced by the phytopathogen pantoea ananatis serrano is reported herein. as with all other substances of this class, the lactone moiety possesses s configuration, corroborating the hypothesis that it shares the same biosynthetic pathway as the (s)-n-hexanoylhomoserine lactone and  also that some luxi homologues can accept both hexanoyl- and heptanoyl-acp as precursors. evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of enantiomeric acylhomoserine lactones against three gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, and staphylococcus aureus) revealed important features between absolute configuration and antimicrobial activity. the n-heptanoylhomoserine lactone was considerably less active than the 3-oxo derivatives. surprisingly, non-natural (r)-n-(3-oxo-octanoyl)homoserine lactone was as active as the s enantiomer against b. cereus, while the synthetic racemic product was less active than either enantiomer.
