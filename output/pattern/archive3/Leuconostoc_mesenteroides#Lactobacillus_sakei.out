antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
study of the lactobacillus sakei protective effect towards spoilage bacteria in vacuum packed cooked ham analyzed by pcr-dgge.
the effectiveness of lactobacillus sakei b-2 inoculated as a protective culture on the inhibition of spoilage bacteria on sliced vacuum packed cooked ham was investigated by using culture-dependent and -independent approaches. total microbial dna was directly extracted from both control and treatment samples, and subjected to a nested pcr protocol, pcr-dgge analysis was used to identify and monitor the dynamic changes in the microbial population, followed by partial 16s rdna sequencing. the dgge profile demonstrated that the protective culture effectively suppressed growth of predominant spoilage bacteria l. sakei, lactobacillus curvatus and leuconostoc mesenteroides in cooked ham during storage at 4 degrees c, however, growth of uncultured leuconostoc was not inhibited. the shelf-life of this product inoculated with l. sakei b-2, at levels of 5.91+/-0.04log(10)cfug(-1) was 35 days, compared to 15 days of control samples, when the ham was stored at 4 degrees c.
lactic acid bacteria associated with vacuum-packed cooked meat product spoilage:  population analysis by rdna-based methods.
aim: to determine the lactic acid bacteria (lab) implicated in bloating spoilage  of vacuum-packed and refrigerated meat products. methods and results: a total of 18 samples corresponding to four types of meat products, with and without spoilage symptoms, were studied. in all, 387 colonies growing on de man, rogosa and sharpe, yeast glucose lactose peptone and trypticase soy yeast extract plates were identified by internal spacer region (isr), isr-restriction fragment length polymorphism and rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis profiles as lactobacillus (37%), leuconostoc (43%), carnobacterium (11%), enterococcus (4%) and lactococcus (2%). leuconostoc mesenteroides dominated the microbial population of spoiled products and was always present at the moment bloating occurred. lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus curvatus were found in decreasing order of abundance. the analysis of two meat products, 'morcilla' and 'fiambre de magro adobado' obtained from production lines revealed a common succession pattern in lab populations in both products and showed that leuc. mesenteroides became the main species during storage, despite being below the detection level of culture methods after packing. conclusions: our results pointed to leuc. mesenteroides as the main species responsible for bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed meat products. significance and impact of the study: prevention of bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed cooked meat products requires the sensitive detection of leuc. mesenteroides (i.e. by pcr).
the sensory acceptability of cooked meat products treated with a protective culture depends on glucose content and buffering capacity: a case study with lactobacillus sakei 10a.
biopreservation has been proven to be a promising natural preservation technique, but the impact of protective cultures on the sensory properties of cooked meat products (cmp) is not well documented. this work presents a case study on the protective culture lactobacillus sakei 10a to obtain a clear view on the real consequences of using protective cultures on the sensory quality of cmp. a preliminary screening study on 13 different cmp and more elaborate application trials at 7 degrees c on vacuum packaged pate, cooked ham, cooked sausage and two cooked poultry products demonstrated that l. sakei 10a inhibits the endogenous lab-flora, leuconostoc mesenteroides, brochothrix thermosphacta and listeria monocytogenes. despite these promising antagonistic effects, the application of l. sakei 10a to cmp was in some cases limited by a significant acidification resulting in an acid taste of the product. this was most obvious in pate and cooked sausage and less obvious in cooked turkey fillet. from the results a hypothesis could be derived that high buffering capacity and low glucose content are key elements to avoid sensory deviations when applying protective cultures on cmp.
evaluation of meat born lactic acid bacteria as protective cultures for the biopreservation of cooked meat products.
in this study, 91 strains, originating from meat products, were subjected to a step-by-step screening and characterisation to search for potential protective cultures to be used in the cooked cured meat industry. strains were first tested on their homofermentative and psychrotrophic character and salt tolerance. secondly, the antibacterial capacities towards listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc carnosum and brochotrix thermosphacta were determined in an agar spot test. in total, 38% of the tested strains were inhibitory towards all indicator strains. however, 91%, 88% and 74% of the strains could inhibit, respectively, l. monocytogenes, b. thermosphacta and leuc. mesenteroides. finally, 12 strains, with the highest antibacterial capacities, were evaluated on their competitive nature by comparing their growth rate, acidifying character and lactic acid production at 7 degrees c under anaerobic conditions in a liquid broth. all 12 strains, except for a bacteriocin producing lactobacillus plantarum strain and the lactocin s producing lactobacillus sakei 148, combined a fast growth rate with a deep and rapid acidification caused by the production of high levels of lactic acid. the 12 selected strains were then further investigated for their growth capacity on a model cooked ham product to establish whether the presence of these cultures on the ham did not negatively influence the sensory properties of the ham. all strains grew in 6 days at 7 degrees c from a level of 10(5)-10(6) to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g and again the bacteriocin producing l. plantarum strain was the slowest growing strain. as the glucose level of the model cooked ham product was low (0.09+/-0.03%), growth of the putative protective cultures resulted in glucose depletion and a limited lactic acid production and accompanying ph decrease. cooked ham inoculated with isolates 13e, 10a, 14a (all three identified as l. sakei subsp. carnosus by sds-page) and with strains l. sakei 148 (ls5) and l. sakei subsp. carnosus saga 777 (ls8) were not rejected by the sensory panel at the 34th day of the vacuum packaged storage at 7 degrees c. therefore, these strains could have potential for the use as protective culture in cooked meat products.
influence of antimicrobial agents on the spoilage of a meat-based entomophage diet.
the microbial decomposition of a meat-based entomophage diet presented in parafilm packets was investigated. considerable bacteria but not fungi were associated with components used to prepare the diet (i.e., hens' eggs, liver, and ground beef). at the initial sampling time, there were no differences among diet treatments in the size of bacterial or fungal populations. bacterial populations in diets not containing antibacterial agents rapidly increased and reached an asymptote by 24 h (approximately 10(10) colony-forming units per gram). bacterial populations also increased in diets containing antibacterial agents, but they were significantly smaller than in diets not containing antibacterial agents. the most prevalent bacteria isolated were carnobacterium piscicola, carnobacterium divergens, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and enterococcus spp., regardless of the antibacterial treatment used. the proliferation of fungi was delayed relative to bacteria, but significant differences were observed among the diet treatments. fungi were most inhibited by sorbic acid and propionic acid in the absence of antibacterial agents. the most common fungi isolated were the yeasts candida zeylanoides, torulaspora globosa, and yarrowia lipolytica. the ph of diets not containing antibacterial agents decreased rapidly and was highly correlated with increases in bacteria but not fungi. the results of this study demonstrate that antimicrobial agents significantly inhibit spoilage microorganisms in a meat-based diet and that alternative management strategies to delay the decomposition of such diets presented in parafilm packets should target lactic acid spoilage bacteria, particularly carnobacterium and lactobacillus species.
an analysis of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from malted barley.
aims: the aim of this study was to perform a detailed characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from malted barley. methods and results: bacteriocin activities produced by eight lab, isolated from various types of malted barley, were purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation, cation exchange, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase liquid chromatography. molecular mass analysis and n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified bacteriocins showed that four non-identical lactobacillus sakei strains produced sakacin p, while four leuconostoc mesenteroides strains were shown to produce bacteriocins highly similar or identical to leucocin a, leucocin c or mesenterocin y105. two of these bacteriocin-producing strains, lb. sakei 5 and leuc. mesenteroides 6, were shown to produce more than one bacteriocin. lactobacillus sakei 5 produced sakacin p as well as two novel bacteriocins, which were termed sakacin 5x and sakacin 5t. the inhibitory spectrum of each purified bacteriocin was analysed and demonstrated that sakacin 5x was capable of inhibiting the widest range of beer spoilage organisms. conclusion: all bacteriocins purified in this study were class ii bacteriocins. two of the bacteriocins have not been described previously in the literature while the remaining purified bacteriocins have been isolated from environments other than malted barley. significance and impact of the study: this study represents a thorough analysis of bacteriocin-producing lab from malt and demonstrates, for the first time, the variety of previously identified and novel inhibitory peptides produced by isolates from this environment. it also highlights the potential of these lab cultures to be used as biological controlling agents in the brewing industry.
surface application of lysozyme, nisin, and edta to inhibit spoilage and pathogenic bacteria on ham and bologna.
a study was conducted to determine if the effectiveness of an antimicrobial treatment for cooked ham and bologna would be increased or maintained when applied in a surface coating. cooked 10-g disks of ham and bologna sausage received one of three treatments: no coating (control), coating with 0.2 g of 7% (wt/vol) gelatin gel (gel-control), or coating with 0.2 g of 7% gelatin gel containing 25.5 g/liter of lysozyme-nisin (1:3) plus 25.5 g/liter of edta (gel-treated). the samples were then inoculated with one of six test organisms: brochothrix thermosphacta, escherichia coli o157:h7, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, listeria monocytogenes, or salmonella typhimurium. inoculated samples were vacuum packed and stored at 8 degrees c for 4 weeks. the antimicrobial gel treatment had an immediate bactericidal effect up to 4 log cfu/cm2 on the four gram-positive organisms tested (b. thermosphacta, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and listeria monocytogenes) and inhibited the growth of these organisms during the 4 weeks of storage. the antimicrobial gel treatment also had a bactericidal effect on the growth of salmonella typhimurium during storage. the numbers of e. coli o157:h7 on ham were reduced by 2 log cfu/cm2 following treatment with both antimicrobial-containing and non-antimicrobial-containing gels during the 4-week storage period. no effect was observed on the growth of e. coli o157:h7 on bologna.
