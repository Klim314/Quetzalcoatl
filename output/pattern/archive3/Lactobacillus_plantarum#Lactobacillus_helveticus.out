growth, survival, and peptidolytic activity of lactobacillus plantarum i91 in a hard-cheese model.
in this work, we studied the growth, survival, and peptidolytic activity of lactobacillus plantarum i91 in a hard-cheese model consisting of a sterile extract of reggianito cheese. to assess the influence of the primary starter and initial proteolysis level on these parameters, we prepared the extracts with cheeses that were produced using 2 different starter strains of lactobacillus helveticus 138 or 209 (lh138 or lh209) at 3 ripening times: 3, 90, and 180 d. the experimental extracts were inoculated with lb. plantarum i91; the control extracts were not inoculated and the blank extracts were heat-treated to inactivate enzymes and were not inoculated. all extracts were incubated at 34 degrees c for 21 d, and then the ph, microbiological counts, and proteolysis profiles were determined. the basal proteolysis profiles in the extracts of young cheeses made with either strain tested were similar, but many differences between the proteolysis profiles of the extracts of the lh138 and lh209 cheeses were found when riper cheeses were used. the ph values in the blank and control extracts did not change, and no microbial growth was detected. in contrast, the ph value in experimental extracts decreased, and this decrease was more pronounced in extracts obtained from either of the young cheeses and from the lh209 cheese at any stage of ripening. lactobacillus plantarum i91 grew up to 8 log during the first days of incubation in all of the extracts, but then the number of viable cells decreased, the extent of which depended on the starter strain and the age of the cheese used for the extract. the decrease in the counts of lb. plantarum i91 was observed mainly in the extracts in which the ph had diminished the most. in addition, the extracts that best supported the viability of lb. plantarum i91 during incubation had the highest free amino acids content. the effect of lb. plantarum i91 on the proteolysis profile of the extracts was marginal. significant changes in the content of free amino acids suggested that the catabolism of free amino acids by lb. plantarum i91 prevailed in a weakly proteolyzed medium, whereas the release of amino acids due to peptidolysis overcame their catabolism in a medium with high levels of free amino acids. lactobacillus plantarum i91 was able to use energy sources other than lactose to support its growth because equivalent numbers of cells were observed in extracts containing residual amounts of lactose and in lactose-depleted extracts. the contribution of lb. plantarum i91 to hard-cooked cheese peptidolysis was negligible compared with that of the starter strain; however, its ability to transform amino acids is a promising feature of this strain.
isolation and preliminary probiotic selection of lactobacilli from koumiss in inner mongolia.
from 16 samples of traditional fermented koumiss collected in inner mongolia autonomous region of china, forty-eight lactobacilli strains were isolated and phenotypically characterized by their abilities to ferment different carbohydrates and by additional biochemical tests. the dominant lactobacilli species were identified as l. casei (17 strains), l. helveticus (10 strains) and l. plantarum (8 strains), with a lower frequency of isolation for l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis (5 strains), l. paracasei (3 strains), l. kefiranofaciens (2 strains), l. curvatus (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and w. kandleri (1 strain). the ph values of all these samples were ranging from 3.37 to 3.94. in isolates, l. casei zhang, l. helveticus zl12-1, and l. plantarum bx6-6 were selected as potentially probiotic strains through the preliminary tests including resistance to low acid, abilities to grow in mrs with bile salts, antimicrobial activities and the viabilities during prolonged cold storage in fermented milk. moreover 16s rdna was conducted to confirm the identification.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
[bacteriocin typing of lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. l. acidophilus-l. salivarious, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. helveticus, l. lactis and l. leichmannii were used in the study. the cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. the method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. it allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into bacteriocin types within the species. this may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.
[sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
[sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
sensitivity of 167 cultures of lactobacilli of streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. jugurti, l. salivarius, l. lactis, l. helveticus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied. it was found that the cultures of l. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of l. casei and all cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by lactobacilli of different species.
