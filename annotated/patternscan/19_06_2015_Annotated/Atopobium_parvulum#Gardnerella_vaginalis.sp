TI  == susceptibility testing of atopobium vaginae for dequalinium chloride.
AB  == background: atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis are major markers for bacterial vaginosis. we aimed to determine the mic and mbc range of the broad-spectrum anti-infective and antiseptic dequalinium chloride for 28 strains, belonging to 4 species of the genus atopobium, i.e. a. vaginae, a. minutum, a. rimae and a. parvulum. methods: the mic was determined with a broth microdilution assay. results: the mic and mbc for atopobium spp. for dequalinium chloride ranged between < 0.0625 and 2 mug/ml. conclusions: this study demonstrated that dequalinium chloride inhibits and kills clinical isolates of a. vaginae at concentrations similar to those of clindamycin and lower than those of metronidazole.
