TI  == nature of the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus caseibifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities as well as the nature of the inhibitory compounds obtained from lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis strains were assayed on foodborne pathogenic - staphyloccoccus aureus subsp. aureus (ccug atcc(r) 25926) and escherichia coli (atcc(r) 25922) - and spoilage microorganisms - pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc(r) 27853). test producer strains showed inhibitory effect on all indicator microorganisms in diffusion of  cell-free concentrated supernatant by agar in well methods (10.0-22.5 mm) in periods of 24, 48 and 72 h. inhibitory compounds showed no sensitivity to the action of proteolytic enzyme trypsin and were completely inactivated by adjusting the ph of the cell-free 20 x concentrated supernatant to 7.0. the results demonstrated that antimicrobial substances do not have proteinaceous nature and are caused by the action of organic acids with decreasing medium ph.

TI  == probiotics in the prevention of eczema: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to evaluate a multistrain, high-dose probiotic in the prevention of eczema. design: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. settings: antenatal clinics, research clinic, children at home. patients:  pregnant women and their infants. interventions: women from 36 weeks gestation and their infants to age 6 months received daily either the probiotic (lactobacillus salivarius cul61, lactobacillus paracasei cul08, bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium bifidum cul20; total of 10(10) organisms/day) or matching placebo. main outcome measure: diagnosed eczema at age 2 years. infants were followed up by questionnaire. clinical examination and skin prick tests to common allergens were done at 6 months and 2 years. results: the cumulative frequency of diagnosed eczema at 2 years was similar in the probiotic (73/214, 34.1%) and placebo arms (72/222, 32.4%; or 1.07, 95% ci 0.72 to 1.6). among the secondary outcomes, the cumulative frequency of skin prick sensitivity at 2 years was reduced in the probiotic (18/171; 10.5%) compared with the placebo arm (32/173; 18.5%; or 0.52, 95% ci 0.28 to 0.98). the  statistically significant differences between the arms were mainly in sensitisation to cow's milk and hen's egg proteins at 6 months. atopic eczema occurred in 9/171 (5.3%) children in the probiotic arm and 21/173 (12.1%) in the  placebo arm (or 0.40, 95% ci 0.18 to 0.91). conclusions: the study did not provide evidence that the probiotic either prevented eczema during the study or reduced its severity. however, the probiotic seemed to prevent atopic sensitisation to common food allergens and so reduce the incidence of atopic eczema in early childhood. trial registration number: isrctn26287422.

TI  == the beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  == background: the structure of exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a  few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. results: the strain named bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03  with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (eps) yield was selected to study the effect of its eps on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. the results indicated that eps significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis indicated that the eps significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. when receiving a low dose of eps, bacteroidales sp./lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and l. johnsonii, l. animalis and l. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a  high concentration of eps. conclusion: the combination of viable cell count, dgge and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity  in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of eps from b. bifidum wbin03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health  of their hosts.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == use of tuf gene-based primers for the pcr detection of probiotic bifidobacterium  species and enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented milk by cultural and quantitative real-time pcr methods.
AB  == due to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay  of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. in this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay of b. animalis subsp. animalis, b. animalis subsp. lactis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of bifidobacterium, respectively. these bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. when each target bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, pcr product with expected size was generated. in addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other bifidobacterium species, strains of lactobacillus spp., enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. pcr assay with primers specific to b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. in addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with bim-25 agar and the quantitative real-time pcr showed similar cell counts. such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 degrees c) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == dietary supplementation with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria is well tolerated and not associated with adverse events during late pregnancy and early infancy.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are increasingly being administered to pregnant women and infants with the intention of improving health. although these organisms have a long record of safe use, it is important to identify any adverse effects in potentially vulnerable populations. in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the safety of a bacterial dietary supplement for the prevention of atopy in infants. two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius cul61 and lactobacillus paracasei cul08) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20) with a total of 1 x 10(10) colony-forming units were administered  daily to women during the last month of pregnancy and to infants aged 0-6 mo. adverse events (ae) were classified according to who international statistical classification of diseases criteria. common symptoms were recorded by regular questionnaires. baseline characteristics of 220 mother-infant dyads in the treatment and 234 in the placebo group were similar. compliance with the trial interventions, loss to follow-up, symptoms, drug usage, infant growth, method of  feeding, visits to the doctor, and mothers' assessment of infant health were similar in the 2 groups. fifteen (6.8%) mothers and 73 (33.2%) infants in the treatment group and 21 (9.0%) mothers and 75 (32.1%) infants in the placebo group reported ae (p = 0.49 and p = 0.84, respectively). severe ae occurred in 18 mothers and 63 infants with a similar frequency in each group. none of the ae were attributed to the intervention. our findings support the safe use of this consortium of organisms during pregnancy and early infancy.

TI  == comparison of in vitro models to study bacterial adhesion to the intestinal epithelium.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the adhesion ability of intestinal bacteria to different in vitro models of intestinal epithelia, and to estimate the suitability of these models and the type of interactions involved. methods and results: the adhesion of probiotic (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12), commensal (b. animalis iata-a2 and b. bifidum iata-es2) and potentially pathogenic bacteria (e. coli and l. monocytogenes) was determined. the adhesion models used were polycarbonate-well plates, with or without mucin, and different configurations of caco-2 and/or ht29-mtx cell cultures. all bacteria adhered to wells without mucin (2.6-27.3%), the values being highly variable depending on the bacterial strain. adhesion percentages of potentially probiotic bacteria to caco-2 cultures were remarkably lower (p < 0.05) than those to mucin, and more similar to those of pathogenic strains. the lowest adhesion of different bacterial strains was detected on ht29-mtx (0.5-2.3%) cultures and caco-2/ht29-mtx (0.6-3.2%) cocultures, while these values were increased in caco-2 cultures plus mucin. conclusions: the results suggested that bacterial strains exhibit different capacities to adhere to cellular components and several types of mucin present in different models, showing preferences for intestinal muc2. significance and impact of the study: the use of caco-2 cells monolayer plus mucin (type ii) better approaches the physiological characteristics of in vivo situation, providing a reliable and suitable in vitro model to evaluate bacterial adhesion.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

TI  == production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB  == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and  by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact,  the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == antiproliferative effect of fermented milk on the growth of a human breast cancer cell line.
AB  == in vivo and in vitro studies have shown an antitumor activity of lactobacilli in  colon cancer, and some epidemiologic studies have indicated a reduced risk of breast cancer in women who consume fermented milk products. we studied the direct effect of milk fermented by five bacteria strains (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium animalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus paracasei) on the growth of the mcf7 breast cancer cell line. our results showed a growth inhibition induced by all fermented milks, even though b. infantis and l. acidophilus were the most effective (85% inhibition after 9 days). the antiproliferative effect was not related to the presence of bacteria in fermented milk, and neither whole milk (crude or ultrahigh temperature sterlizied) nor its main fractions (lactalbumin or beta-lactoglobulin fraction) affected cell growth. our findings suggest the presence of an ex novo soluble compound produced by lactic acid bacteria during milk fermentation or the microbial transformation of some milk components in a biologically active form. although the mechanism of the antitumor activity is not clear, the present study  suggests the potentiality offered by fermented milk as producers of compounds with antiproliferative activity useful in the prevention and therapy of solid tumors like breast cancer.
