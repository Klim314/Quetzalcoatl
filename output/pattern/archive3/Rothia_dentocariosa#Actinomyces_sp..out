regulation of lactate dehydrogenase activity in rothia dentocariosa by fructose 1,6-diphosphate and adenosine 5'-triphosphate.
the l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase from rothia dentocariosa strain 17931 is activated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate and inhibited by adenosine 5'-triphosphate. the enzyme has a molecular weight of 120,000. in these respects, it resembles the lactate dehydrogenase of actinomyces viscosus.
