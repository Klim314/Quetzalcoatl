TI  == chronic botulism in a saxony dairy farm: sources, predisposing factors, development of the disease and treatment possibilities.
AB  == the aim of this study is to investigate clostridium botulinum at a saxony dairy farm with 159 cows and 18 heifers. the animals exhibited clinical symptoms of chronic botulism. to determine the source of the infection, feces, blood, organs, and gastrointestinal fluids of dead or euthanized cows; as well as soil, water, silage and manure were tested for c. botulinum spores and bonts using elisa. bont/c and c. botulinum type c were detected in 53% and 3% of tested animals, respectively, while bont/d and c. botulinum type d were detected in 18% of the animals. c. botulinum also was detected in organs, gastrointestinal fluids, drinking water and manure. to evaluate possible treatments, animals were given jerusalem artichoke syrup (jas), botulism vaccine (formalinised aluminum hydroxide gel adsorbed toxoid of c. botulinum types c and d) or a suspension of enterococcus faecalis. after four weeks treatment with jas, bont/c and c. botulinum type c were not detected in feces. in contrast, bont/d and c. botulinum type d were not significantly influenced by the jas treatment. vaccination with botulism vaccine and the e. faecalis suspension significantly decreased bont/d and c. botulinum type d. a significant increase of enterococci was detected in animals treated with e. faecalis. interestingly, there was a negative correlation between the detection of both bont and c. botulinum with the concentration of enterococci in feces. although c. botulinum c and d antibodies increased significantly (p < 0.0001) after vaccination with the botulism vaccine, the reduction of c. botulinum and bont in feces did not result in recovery of the animals because they were deficient of trace elements [manganese (mn), cobalt (co), copper (cu) and selenium (se)]. animals treated with trace elements recovered. it appears that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and trace element deficiency could explain the extensive emergence of chronic botulism.

TI  == the effect of glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro.
AB  == the use of glyphosate modifies the environment which stresses the living microorganisms. the aim of the present study was to determine the real impact of  glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro. the presented results evidence that the highly pathogenic bacteria as salmonella entritidis, salmonella gallinarum, salmonella typhimurium, clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate. however, most of beneficial bacteria as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactobacillus spp. were found to be moderate to highly susceptible. also campylobacter spp. were found to be susceptible to glyphosate. a reduction of beneficial bacteria in the  gastrointestinal tract microbiota by ingestion of glyphosate could disturb the normal gut bacterial community. also, the toxicity of glyphosate to the most prevalent enterococcus spp. could be a significant predisposing factor that is associated with the increase in c. botulinum-mediated diseases by suppressing the antagonistic effect of these bacteria on clostridia.

TI  == a model for the thermal inactivation of micro-organisms.
AB  == aims: to mathematically model published thermal inactivation data sets using an empirical model based on a double arrhenius function. methods and results: a mathematical model, the log r-fat, provided an excellent description of the data  sets available: the thermal inactivation of salmonella anatum at 55 degrees c, pseudomonas viscosa at 48 degrees c and streptococcus faecalis at 60 degrees c; clostridium botulinum spores at various temperatures in the range of 101-121 degrees c (two data sets); thermal inactivation of salmonella bedford over the temperature range 50-58 degrees c, water activity range of 0.94-0.99 and a ph range of 4-7; bacillus stearothermophilus spores from 105 to 121 degrees c and the dry heat sterilization of an indigenous mesophilic soil population over the temperature range of 120-160 degrees c. conclusions: the log r-fat model, derived from previously published chemical inactivation studies provides as good, if not  better, description of thermal inactivation kinetics as other published models. the model does not invoke either of the two hypotheses of inactivation: the mechanistic or vitalistic, although it is closely linked to descriptions of the former. significance and impact of the study: the log r-fat double arrhenius function provides the investigator with a relatively simple and easy mathematical model to apply to data of thermal inactivation. this model may allow a more accurate description of thermal food processing, especially when the safety of marginal heat processes are concerned.

TI  == transposon tn916 mutagenesis in clostridium botulinum.
AB  == the study of toxinogenesis and other properties in clostridium botulinum is limited by the absence of genetic methods that enable construction of defined mutants. in this study, tetracycline-resistant transposon tn916 in enterococcus faecalis was conjugatively transferred in filter matings to group i clostridium botulinum strains hall a and 113b. the tn916 transfer frequencies to c. botulinum ranged from 10(-8) to 10(-5) tcr transconjugant per recipient depending on the donor strain. southern blot analyses of ecori or hindiii chromosomal digests extracted from randomly selected tcr transconjugants showed that the transposon inserted at different sites in the recipient chromosome, and the copy number of tn916 varied from one to three. tn916 insertion gave several different auxotrophic mutants. this approach should be useful for the study of genes important in growth, survival, and toxinogenesis in c. botulinum.

TI  == seasonal occurrence and distribution of microbial indicators and pathogens in the rhode river of chesapeake bay.
AB  == the seasonal incidence and occurrence of indicator organisms and pathogens were studied at four sites in the rhode river, a subestuary of chesapeake bay. the highest frequency of occurrence of total and fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci was in muddy creek, a marsh area receiving pasture land runoff. second highest frequency of occurrence of these bacteria was in cadle creek, a populated area. lowest measurements of these parameters were obtained at stations in the central portion of the rhode river. no salmonella spp. were detected by the methods employed in this study. however, it is concluded that if these organisms are present, the concentrations are less than or equal to 1 organism per liter. the presence of clostridium botulinum was detected in 12% of the samples tested.
