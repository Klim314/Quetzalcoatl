TI  - [Repression of bacterial biofilms in suppurative necrotic complications of diabetic foot syndrome by ultrasound cavitation].
AB  - AIM: Study of wound microbial landscape in suppurative necrotic complications in  patients with diabetic foot syndrome (DFS), and a possibility of suppression of bacterial biofilm development in these wounds by ultrasound cavitation (USC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 2 randomized groups of patients were included in the study: main group of 145 individuals with suppurative necrotic complications of DFS, who received ultrasound cavitation therapy, and comparison group of 86 patients who received basic therapy. In the main group Sonoca-180 (Siring, Germany) unit, that allows to combine the process of mechanical wound treatment with antibacterial action of low frequency ultrasound, was used for wound treatment. Quantitative and qualitative composition of wound microflora was studied by using bacteriological method with parallel utilization of transmission and scanning electron microscopy in the dynamic of USC treatment. RESULTS: In patients with DFS bacterial biofilms containing congestions in the polysaccharide matrix and fixed at the surface of dense structure of periostenum wound were detected. In the microbial landscape in DFS patients in 21% of cases aerobic-anaerobic microflora was detected, while associations included mostly from 2 to 5 bacteria species--members of the Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Bacteroides genera. Bacteria of Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Escherichia and Klebsiella sp. genera were detected less frequently. Application of USC in the main group resulted in a decrease of microbial contamination of wounds in the short-term. CONCLUSION: USC method, when compared with classical therapy approach in DFS complications, in patients with suppurative necrotic complications allows not only to remove mechanically the necrotic tissues but also to effectively suppress the bacterial biofilms that have formed in the wounds, this promotes the acceleration of recovery process and preparation of the patients for further plastic surgery intervention.
TI  - Biofilm bacterial communities and abundance in a full-scale drinking water distribution system in Shanghai.
AB  - Community diversity and abundance of biofilms from a full-scale drinking water distribution system in Shanghai were characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA sequences and heterotrophic plate count (HPC), respectively. Bacteria affiliated to the Beta- and Gamma-Proteobacteria were dominating in both in-situ and HPC-culturable bacterial communities. Other bacteria present included members of Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Nitrospirae and Firmicutes. Acidovorax, Ralstonia and Acinetobacter were common species in biofilms. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter sp. were detected in the local distribution system. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), residual disinfectant and temperature were the most important factors influencing both bacterial abundance and composition. HPC for biofilm sample was not correlated with its community diversity.
TI  - Detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by Fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  - A fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with F. succinogenes. Consortium-bacterial members were determined by DGGE and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16S rDNA. An artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 F. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. After consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with F. succinogenes. DGGE exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the F. succinogenes group. Sequencing suggested that Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Clostridium sp., F. succinogenes group 2, Prevotella ruminicola and unclassified Bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium and that Treponema bryantii, B. fibrisolvens, Acinetobacter sp, and Wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. However, in the group 3 consortium, F. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic Ruminococcus albus and F. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. This study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.
TI  - Extremophile culture collection from Andean lakes: extreme pristine environments  that host a wide diversity of microorganisms with tolerance to UV radiation.
AB  - A total of 88 bacterial strains were isolated from six Andean lakes situated at altitudes ranging from 3,400 to 4,600 m above sea level: L. Aparejos (4,200 m), L. Negra (4,400 m), L. Verde (4,460 m), L. Azul (4,400 m), L. Vilama (4,600 m), and Salina Grande (3,400 m). Salinity ranged from 0.4 to 117 ppm. General diversity was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. From the excised DGGE bands, 182 bacterial sequences of good quality were obtained. Gammaproteobacteria and Cytophaga/Flavobacterium/Bacteroides (CFB) were the most abundant phylogenetic groups with 42% and 18% of identified bands, respectively. The isolated strains were identified by sequence analysis. Isolated bacteria were subjected to five different UV-B exposure times: 0.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Afterwards, growth of each isolate was monitored and resistance was classified according to the growth pattern. A wide interspecific variation among the 88 isolates was observed. Medium and highly resistant strains accounted for 43.2% and 28.4% of the isolates, respectively, and only 28.4% was sensitive. Resistance to solar radiation was equally distributed among the isolates from the different lakes regardless of the salinity of the lakes and pigmentation of isolates. Of the highly resistant isolates, 44.5% belonged to gammaproteobacteria, 33.3% to betaproteobacteria, 40% to alphaproteobacteria, 50% to CFB, and among gram-positive organisms, 33.3% were HGC and 44.5% were Firmicutes. Most resistant strains belonged to genera like Exiguobaceterium sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus sp., Micrococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Sphyngomonas sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Stenotrophomonas sp. The current study provides further evidence that gammaproteobacteria are the most abundant and the most UV-B-resistant phylogenetic group in Andean lakes and that UV resistance in bacteria isolated from these environments do not depend on pigmentation and tolerance to salinity.
TI  - Multidrug resistance gene deficient (mdr1a-/-) mice have an altered caecal microbiota that precedes the onset of intestinal inflammation.
AB  - AIM: To compare caecal microbiota from mdr1a(-/-) and wild type (FVB) mice to identify differences in the bacterial community that could influence the intestinal inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and FVB mice were evaluated at 12 and 25 weeks of age using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative real-time PCR. DGGE fingerprints of FVB and mdr1a(-/-) mice (with no intestinal inflammation) at 12 weeks revealed differences in the presence of DNA fragments identified as Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus and an uncultured alphaproteobacterium. Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter sp. were only identified in DGGE profiles of mdr1a(-/-) mice at 25 weeks (with severe intestinal inflammation), which also had a lower number of total bacteria in the caecum compared with FVB mice at same age. CONCLUSIONS: Differences found in the caecal microbiota of FVB and mdr1a(-/-) mice (12 weeks) suggest that the lack of Abcb1 transporters in intestinal cells due to the disruption of the mdr1a gene might lead to changes in the caecal microbiota. The altered microbiota along with the genetic defect could contribute to the development of intestinal inflammation in mdr1a(-/-) mice. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Differences in caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and FVB mice (12 weeks) suggest genotype specific colonization. The results provide evidence that Abcb1 transporters may regulate host interactions with commensal bacteria. Future work is needed to identify the mechanisms involved in this possible cross-talk between the host intestinal cells and microbiota.
TI  - Proteolytic activity in stored aerobic granular sludge and structural integrity.
AB  - Aerobic granules lose stability during storage. The goal of this work was to highlight the main cause of stability loss for stored granules as intracellular protein hydrolysis. The quantity of extracellular proteins was noted to be significantly lower during granule storage, and protease enzyme activities were correspondingly higher in the cores of stored granules. The proteolytic bacteria, which secrete highly active protease enzymes, were for the first time isolated and characterized by analyzing 16S rDNA sequences. The proteolytic bacteria belonged to the genera Pseudomonas, Raoultella, Acinetobacter, Pandoraea, Klebsiella, Bacillus and uncultured bacterium, and were grouped into Proteobacteria, Enterobacteria and Firmicutes. The PB1 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strain, which exhibited very high proteolytic activity during the skim milk agar test, was located at the core regime with active protease enzymes, and was close to the obligate anaerobic strain Bacteroides sp. Hence, the extracellular proteins in stored granules were proposed to be hydrolyzed by enzymes secreted by proteolytic bacteria with the hydrolyzed products ultimately being used by nearby anaerobic strains. This process gradually digests the protein core, and eventually consumes the entire granule.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in water samples from uranium wastes as demonstrated by 16S rDNA and ribosomal intergenic spacer amplification retrievals.
AB  - Bacterial diversity was assessed in water samples collected from several uranium  mining wastes in Ger many and in the United States by using 16S rDNA and ribosomal intergenic spacer amplification retrievals. The results obtained using the 16S rDNA retrieval showed that the samples collected from the uranium mill tailings of Schlema/Alberoda, Germany, were predominated by Nitrospina-like bacteria, whereas those from the mill tailings of Shiprock, New Mexico, USA, were predominated by gamma-Pseudomonas and Frauteria spp. Additional smaller populations of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group and alpha- and delta-Proteobacteria were identified in the Shiprock samples as well. Proteobacteria and Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides were also found in the third uranium mill tailings studied, Gittersee/Coschutz, Germany, but the groups of the predominant clones were rather small. Most of the clones of the Gittersee/Coschutz samples represented individual sequences, which indicates a high level of bacterial diversity. The samples from the fourth uranium waste studied, Steinsee Deponie B1, Germany, were predominantly occupied by Acinetobacter spp. The ribosomal intergenic spacer amplification retrieval provided results complementary to those obtained by the 16S rDNA analyses. For instance, in the Shiprock samples, an additional predominant bacterial group was identified and affiliated with Nitrosomonas sp., whereas in the Gittersee/Coschutz samples, anammox populations were identified that were not retrieved by the applied 16S rDNA approach.
TI  - New antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. Management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. METHODS: This paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition. RESULTS: Patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. Several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). Tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against MRSA, VRE, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. Phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSSI) and intra-abdominal infections. Oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for cSSSI due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. Many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. Tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in Malan ice core from the Tibetan Plateau.
AB  - Three ice core samples were collected from the Malan ice core drilled from the Tibetan Plateau, and three 16S rDNA clone libraries by direct amplification from the ice-melted water were established. Ninety-four clones containing bacterial 16S rDNA inserts were selected. According to restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis, 11 clones were unique in the library from which they were obtained and used for partial sequence and phylogenetic analysis, and compared with 8 reported sequences from the same ice core at depth 70 m. Differences among the samples were apparent in clone libraries. The phylotypes were dominated by the Proteobacteria group, Acinetobacter sp. and Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group. They accounted for 92.5% (Proteobacteria), 100% (Acinetobacter sp.), 34.4% (CFB) and 100% (beta-Proteobacteria) in the clone libraries from the samples at ice depths 35, 64, 70, and 82 m, respectively. The Acinetobacter sp. was only found in the deposition at ice depth 82 m and closely clustered with gamma-Proteobateria. Two members (Malan A-21 and 101) of alpha-Proteobacteria from the sample of 35 m and two (Malan B-26 and 48) of beta-Proteobacteria of 64 m were loosely clustered (< 95% similarity) with known bacteria, represented new genera in ice bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of faropenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against 405 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections from animal and human bites.
AB  - Faropenem, a new oral beta-lactam agent with a penem structure, was very active against 405 aerobic and anaerobic bite isolates. It inhibited 232 of 236 (98%) aerobic isolates, including all Pasteurella spp. and Eikenella corrodens at < or = 0.25 mg/L, and 164/169 (97%) anaerobic isolates, at < or = 1 mg/L. The 10 isolates that required > or = 2 mg/L for inhibition were one strain each of Acinetobacter lwoffi, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Bacteroides ovatus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Peptostreptococcus tetradius, plus Corynebacterium 'aquaticum' (two strains) and Veillonella sp. (three strains).
TI  - The filamentous morphotype Eikelboom type 1863 is not a single genetic entity.
AB  - Five isolates of a filamentous bacterial morphotype with the distinctive diagnostic microscopic features of Eikelboom Type 1863 were obtained from activated sludge sewage treatment plants in Victoria, Australia. On the basis of phenotypic evidence and 16S rDNA sequence data, these isolates proved to be polyphyletic. Two (Ben 06 and Ben 06C) are from the Chryseobacterium subgroup which is in the Cytophaga group, subdivision I of the Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides phylum. Two (Ben 56 and Ben 59) belong to the genus Acinetobacter, and one (Ben 58) is a Moraxella sp., closest to Mor. osloensis. The significance of these findings to the reliance on microscopic features for identification of these filamentous bacteria in activated sludge is discussed.
TI  - Antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). Meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Only one strain each of Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. Of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacteroides sp. All other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
TI  - [Effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  - The results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. In the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella and Actinomyces. Significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. There was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). Antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine used locally showed satisfactory results. The above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: Bacillus coagulans, B. licheniformis, Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the vagina and uterus of healthy cats.
AB  - Bacterial culturing was conducted on samples from the reproductive tracts of 53 clinically healthy female cats. Aerobic bacteria were isolated from 52 of 53 vaginal swab samples and from 2 of 29 uterine swab samples. Anaerobic bacteria were detected in 4 of 30 vaginal and 1 of 29 uterine cultures. The aerobic bacteria included species of Acinetobacter, Actinomyces, Corynebacterium, Escherichia, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus canis, and E coli were the most common organisms and were isolated from 56%, 52%, and 44% of the vaginal samples, respectively. Anaerobes isolated from vaginal samples included 3 species of Bacteroides and 2 isolates of Peptococcus. The single uterine anaerobe isolate was a Lactobacillus sp. The number of bacterial species isolated from each vaginal culture ranged from 1 to 8 (mean, 3). The number of colony forming units tended to vary inversely with the number of bacterial species detected in each sample.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Effect of cefminox on bacterial flora in human adult feces].
AB  - Cefminox (CMNX), a new cephamycin, was administered by one shot intravenous injection twice daily with a dose of 1,000 mg each time for 5 days to seven healthy male volunteers whose ages ranged from 21 to 28 years (mean: 25 years) and body weights were from 60 to 92 kg mean: 72 kg). The effect of the drug on fecal bacterial flora was investigated and the concentrations of the drug in feces were measured on 5th day before the treatment, on 0, 3rd, and 5th day (the final day of the treatment) during the treatment, and on 3rd, 5th, and 10th day after the treatment. Antibiotic susceptibility tests of CMNX, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefotaxime (CTX) against several strains of organisms isolated from feces of the seven volunteers were performed. Clinical adverse reactions and effect on laboratory examinations were also investigated. The results of the study are described as follows. Among Enterobacteriaceae, populations of E. coli, Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp. temporarily disappeared during the treatment of CMNX. After 5-day-treatment, that of Citrobacter sp. transiently increased and the isolation of Enterobacter sp. increased during treatment and up to 5 days after treatment, while those of Proteus sp., H. alvei, or Serratia sp. did not show a definite change. The mean Enterobacteriaceae population in general was 10(8) to 10(9) cells/g feces, showing almost no variation, on all examination days except 5th day during treatment when these organisms were not isolated from only one subject. No remarkable change was not found in populations of other isolated organisms including Gram-negative bacilli; Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Acinetobacter sp., and Gram-positive bacteria; Staphylococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Micrococcus sp. and Candida sp. Among anaerobes, the mean population of Bacteroides sp. was 10(10) to 10(11) cells/g feces, showing almost no variation, and C. difficile was not isolated from any subject, however the toxin was detected in samples from 5 of 7 subjects; one subject showed always positive for toxin on all examination days; 1 on 5th day during treatment to 10th day after treatment; 2 on 5th and 10th day after treatment, and 1 only on 10th day after treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Multicenter study of the activity of pefloxacin on bacteria isolated in a hospital milieu].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pefloxacin were evaluated by agar dilution for 3422 bacterial strains isolated in nine hospitals. Enterobacteriaceae proved very sensitive to pefloxacin: 62 p. 100 of 1743 strains tested had MIC less than or equal to 0.12 and 90 p. 100 less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml; but the percent of strains with MIC greater than or equal to 2 varied among the different groups of Enterobacteriaceae: 2.7 p. 100 for E. coli to 39 p. 100 for Serratia. 55 p. 100 for Pseudomonas and 81 p. 100 of Acinetobacter were inhibited by 1 micrograms/ml or less (mode MIC 1 and 0.5 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp.: 0.03 and 0.06 micrograms/ml and Gonococci were very sensitive to pefloxacin. The spectrum of pefloxacin extended to Gram positive cocci: MIC of Staphylococci were 0.06 to 8 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 0.5); Enterococci, other Streptococci and Pneumococci were less sensitive: 2 and 4 micrograms/ml for the majority of strains. Concerning anaerobic bacteria, pefloxacin was more active against Clostridium (0.5 to 1 microgram/ml generally), than against Bacteroides (4 to 16 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - The susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. Additionally, the MIC of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode MIC varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. A few Enterobacter and Citrobacter strains are resistant. Little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively). Haemophilus sp. (MIC 0.01-0.03) and Neisseria (MIC less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. The MIC of methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; Enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other Streptococci and Pneumococci have low MICs (less than 0.008-0.025). The susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; MIC ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for Clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides sp.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates, including 55 anaerobic bacteria, was tested with ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. Ceftazidime was the most active drug against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. Against Enterobacteriaceae, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were similar to cefotaxime, moxalactam, and cefoperazone and more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. Cefoxitin and moxalactam were significantly more active against Bacteroides fragilis than were the other beta-lactam drugs. Against Staphylococcus aureus, ceftriaxone showed moderate activity, while ceftazidime was relatively inactive. These results indicate a potential role for ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against infections involving facultative and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
