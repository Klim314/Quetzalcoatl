TI  == identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in lebanese patients.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. we conducted a study of 32 lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. the presence or absence of s aureus enterotoxin a, b, c, and d (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. a total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. of these, only 3 (8.8%) were s aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin b). moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. our results could not confirm that s aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the lebanese group studied.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
