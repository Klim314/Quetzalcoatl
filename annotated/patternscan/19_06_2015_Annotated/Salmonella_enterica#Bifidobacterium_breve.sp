TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == cell-free culture supernatant of bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines in human dendritic cells challenged with salmonella typhi through tlr activation.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) constitute the first point of contact between gut commensals and our immune system. despite growing evidence of the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics, the interactions between the cells of the intestinal immune system and bacteria remain largely unknown. indeed,, the aim of this work was to determine whether the probiotic bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 and its cell-free culture supernatant (cfs) have immunomodulatory effects  in human intestinal-like dendritic cells (dcs) and how they respond to the pathogenic bacterium salmonella enterica serovar typhi, and also to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in these interactions. human dcs were directly challenged with b. breve/cfs, s. typhi or a combination of these stimuli for 4 h. the expression pattern of genes involved in toll-like receptor (tlr) signaling pathway and cytokine secretion was analyzed. cfs decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in human intestinal dcs challenged with s. typhi. in contrast, the b. breve cncm i-4035 probiotic strain was a potent inducer of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines tested, i.e., tnf-alpha, il-8 and rantes, as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines including il-10. cfs restored tgf-beta levels in the presence of salmonella. live b.breve and its supernatant enhanced innate immune responses by the activation of tlr signaling pathway. these treatments upregulated tlr9 gene transcription. in addition, cfs was a more potent inducer of tlr9 expression than the probiotic bacteria in the presence of  s. typhi. expression levels of casp8 and irak4 were also increased by cfs, and both treatments induced tollip gene expression. our results indicate that the probiotic strain b. breve cncm i-4035 affects the intestinal immune response, whereas its supernatant exerts anti-inflammatory effects mediated by dcs. this supernatant may protect immune system from highly infectious agents such as salmonella typhi and can down-regulate pro-inflammatory pathways.

TI  == competitive inhibition of three novel bacteria isolated from faeces of breast milk-fed infants against selected enteropathogens.
AB  == numerous in vitro and in vivo studies conducted using different probiotic micro-organisms have demonstrated their ability to interfere with the growth and  virulence of a variety of enteropathogens. the reported beneficial effects of the use of probiotics to complement antibiotic therapy or prevent diarrhoea or gastrointestinal infection in infants have increased in recent years. in the present study, we demonstrated the capacity of supernatants obtained from three novel probiotics (lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4034, bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 and lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-4036) isolated from the faeces of breastfed infants to inhibit the growth of enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic (epec) bacteria, such as escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella. to assess their potential antimicrobial activity, the 17 and 24 h cell-free supernatants broth concentrates (10x) having 1, 2 or 4 % of the three probiotics were incubated with epec bacteria strains. after 17 h of co-culture, the supernatants  were able to inhibit the growth of e. coli, salmonella and shigella up to 40, 55  and 81 %, respectively. however, the inhibitory capacity of some supernatants was maintained or completely lost when the supernatants (ph 3.0) were neutralised (ph 6.5). overall, these results demonstrated that l. paracasei cncm i-4034, b. breve cncm i-4035 and l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036 produce compounds that exhibited strain-specific inhibition of enterobacteria and have the potential to be used as probiotics in functional foods.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria attenuate the proinflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == inflammation is a physiological response to infections and tissue injury; however, abnormal immune responses can give rise to chronic inflammation and contribute to disease progression. various dietary components, including probiotic lactic acid bacteria and prebiotics, have the potential to modulate intestinal inflammatory responses. one factor in particular, the chemokine interleukin-8 (il-8, cxcl-8), is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. the purpose of this study was to investigate modulation of the inflammatory host response induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in the presence of selected probiotics and lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from human sources, dairy products, and farm animals. il-8 gene expression and protein production in ht-29 cells were evaluated by real-time pcr  and elisa, respectively. pre-incubation of ht-29 cells with lactobacillus kefir im002, bifidobacterium adolescentis frp 61, bifidobacterium longum frp 68 and frp 69, bifidobacterium breve frp 334, and leuconostoc mesenteroides im080 significantly inhibited il-8 secretion induced by salmonella typhimurium dt104. co-culture of selected probiotics and salmonella typhimurium dt104 reduced il-8 production, while potential probiotics and lab had no effect on il-8 secretion in ht-29 cells preincubated with salmonella typhimurium dt104 prior to adding probiotics. lactobacillus kefir im002 supernatant also significantly reduced il-8 production. in conclusion, our study suggests that probiotic bifidobacteria and lab modulate cytokine induction and possess anti-inflammatory properties; however, the effectiveness is strain dependent.

TI  == intestinal epithelial cells modulate antigen-presenting cell responses to bacterial dna.
AB  == intestinal epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells orchestrate mucosal innate immunity. this study investigated the role of bacterial dna in modulating  epithelial and bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells (bm-apcs) and subsequent t-lymphocyte responses. murine mode-k epithelial cells and bm-apcs were treated with dna from either bifidobacterium breve or salmonella enterica serovar dublin directly and under coculture conditions with cd4(+) t cells. apical stimulation of mode-k cells with s. dublin dna enhanced secretion of cytokines from underlying bm-apcs and induced interleukin-17 (il-17) and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) secretion from cd4(+) t cells. bacterial dna isolated from either strain induced maturation and increased cytokine secretion from bm-apcs. conditioned medium from s. dublin-treated mode-k cells elicited an increase in cytokine secretion similar to that seen for s. dublin dna. treatment of conditioned medium from mode-k cells with rnase and protease prevented the s. dublin-induced increased cytokine secretion. oral feeding of mice with b. breve dna resulted in enhanced levels of colonic il-10 and transforming growth factor beta (tgfbeta) compared with what was seen for mice treated with s. dublin dna. in contrast, feeding mice with s. dublin dna increased levels of colonic il-17 and il-12p70. t cells from s. dublin dna-treated mice secreted high levels of il-12 and ifn-gamma compared to controls and b. breve dna-treated mice. these results demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells are able to modulate subsequent antigen-presenting and t-cell responses to bacterial dna with pathogenic but not commensal bacterial dna inducing effector cd4(+) t lymphocytes.

TI  == surface expression of toll-like receptor 9 is upregulated on intestinal epithelial cells in response to pathogenic bacterial dna.
AB  == colonic epithelial cells are constantly exposed to high levels of bacterial dna in the intestinal lumen and must recognize and respond appropriately to pathogens, while they maintain a tolerance to nonpathogenic commensal bacterial strains. bacterial dna is recognized by toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9). the aim of this study was to investigate tlr9 expression and localization in colonic epithelial cells under basal conditions and in response to bacterial dna. ht-29 cells were exposed to dna from various strains of commensal and pathogenic microbes. tlr9 mrna expression was determined by real-time reverse transcription-pcr, and interleukin-8 (il-8) secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. localization of tlr9 was determined by flow cytometry in ht-29 cells and by immunofluorescence in ht-29 cells and mouse colonic tissue. immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that there was intracellular and surface expression of tlr9 in ht-29 cells under basal conditions. exposure of cells to dna from pathogenic strains of salmonella and escherichia coli resulted in a significant increase in tlr9 mrna expression. salmonella enterica serovar dublin dna increased surface tlr9 protein and il-8 secretion. there was no change in mrna levels or localization of tlr9 in response to bifidobacterium breve. chloroquine did not block il-8 secretion in response to s. enterica serovar dublin dna. tlr9 was expressed on the colonic apical surface  in wild-type mice but not in germfree mice. these results demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells recognize pathogenic bacterial dna and respond by increasing surface localization and expression of tlr9, suggesting that the epithelial inflammatory response to pathogenic dna is mediated at least in part by increased tlr9 expression.

TI  == increased resistance of mice to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection by synbiotic administration of bifidobacteria and transgalactosylated oligosaccharides.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of bifidobacteria in combination with transgalactosylated oligosaccharides (tos) against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt-2 in an opportunistic antibiotic-induced murine infection model in mice was examined. methods and results: b. breve (strain yakult) with natural resistance to streptomycin sulphate (sm, mic: > 4 mg ml(-1)), when given daily at a dose of 108 cfu/mouse orally under sm treatment was constantly excreted at 10(10) cfu g(-1) faeces so long as sm was administered, even at 2 weeks after discontinuing administration of b. breve. explosive intestinal growth and subsequent extra-intestinal translocation of orally infected lt-2 under sm treatment were inhibited by b. breve colonization, and this anti-infectious activity was strengthened by synbiotic administration of tos with b. breve. comparison of anti-salmonella activity among several bifidobacterium strains with natural resistance to sm revealed that strains such as b. bifidum atcc 15696 and  b. catenulatum atcc 27539t conferred no activity, even when they reached high population levels similar those of effective strains such as strain yakult and b. pseudocatenulatum dsm 20439. both the increase in the concentration of organic acids and the lowered ph in the intestine due to bifidobacterial colonization correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, the crude cecal extract of b. breve-colonized mice exerted growth-inhibitory activity against lt-2 in vitro, whereas that of the ineffective b. bifidum-colonized cecum showed much lower activity. conclusions: intestinal colonization by bifidobacteria given exogenously together with tos during antibiotic treatment prevents the antibiotic-induced disruption of colonization resistance to oral infection with s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and the metabolic activity needed to produce organic acids and lower the intestinal ph is important in the anti-infectious activity of synbiotics against enteric infection with salmonella. significance and impact of the study: these results indicate that certain bifidobacteria together with prebiotics may be used for the prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections with antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
