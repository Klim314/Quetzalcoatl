TI  == coaggregation and biofilm growth of granulicatella spp. with fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: members of fastidious granulicatella and aggregatibacter genera belong to normal oral flora bacteria that can cause serious infections, such as infective endocarditis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has long been implicated in aggressive periodontitis, whereas dna-based methods only recently showed an association between granulicatella spp. and dental diseases. as bacterial coaggregation is a key phenomenon in the development of oral and nonoral multispecies bacterial communities it would be of interest knowing coaggregation pattern of granulicatella species with a. actinomycetemcomitans in  comparison with the multipotent coaggregator fusobacterium nucleatum. the aim was to investigate coaggregation and biofilm formation of granulicatella elegans and  granulicatella adiacens with a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum strains. results: f. nucleatum exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher autoaggregation than all other test species, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans sa269 and g. elegans. a. actinomycetemcomitans cu1060 and g. adiacens did not autoaggregate. g. elegans with f. nucleatum exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher coaggregation than most others, but failed to grow as biofilm together or separately. with f. nucleatum as partner, a. actinomycetemcomitans strains sa269, a rough-colony wild-type strain, and cu1060, a spontaneous smooth-colony laboratory variant, and g. adiacens were the next in coaggregation efficiency. these dual species combinations also were able to grow as biofilms. while both g. elegans and g. adiacens coaggregated with a. actinomycetemcomitans strain sa269,  but not with cu1060, they grew as biofilms with both a. actinomycetemcomitans strains. conclusions: g. elegans failed to form biofilm with f. nucleatum despite the strongest coaggregation with it. the ability of granulicatella spp. to coaggregate and/or form biofilms with f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains suggests that granulicatella spp. have the potential to integrate into dental plaque biofilms.

TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == comparison of maldi-tof ms and vitek 2 system for laboratory diagnosis of granulicatella and abiotrophia species causing invasive infections.
AB  == granulicatella and abiotrophia spp. were known as nutritionally variant streptococci (nvs). such strains have caused major diagnostic difficulties due to fastidious culturing and unspecific colony morphology. the present study is aimed at comparing the performance of laboratory available diagnostic methods for nvs isolates and determining the antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates. fourteen clinical invasive isolates, consisting of 10 granulicatella adiacens, 1  granulicatella elegans, and 3 abiotrophia defectiva were in parallel analyzed by  2 matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) systems, i.e., bruker ms and vitek ms, as well as vitek 2 for the  species determination. 16s rrna gene sequencing was applied as a reference method. the vitek ms gave correct identification for all 14 isolates. the bruker  ms could correctly identify 8/10 g. adiacens, 0/1 g. elegans, and 3/3 a. defectiva isolates at the first analysis occasion, and all 14 isolates became identifiable after repeated tests. the vitek 2 system could identify 6/10 g. adiacens, 1/1 g. elegans, and 2/3 a. defectiva isolates at the species level. antimicrobial susceptibilities of 11 antibiotics were determined by etest. resistance against ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, rifampicin, and tetracycline were  observed in 4, 10, 4, and 1 isolates, respectively. in conclusion, maldi-tof ms is a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of nvs. phenotypic testing by vitek 2 is only partially effective for the accurate identification of such strains. the emergence of resistant nvs isolates indicates the necessity of monitoring antimicrobial susceptibilities of such uncommon pathogens.

TI  == use of groesl as a target for identification of abiotrophia, granulicatella, and  gemella species.
AB  == we determined the groesl sequences of three species of nutritionally variant streptococci (abiotrophia defectiva, granulicatella adiacens, and granulicatella  elegans) and three gemella species (gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, and gemella sanguinis). the nucleotide sequence similarities between the groes and groel genes of the above genera were 41.7 to 85.9% and 63.7 to 84.3%, respectively. the intraspecies similarities of groesl sequences for the isolates  of abiotrophia and granulicatella species were 94.4 to 97.8% for groes and 94.0 to 98.2% for groel. for ge. morbillorum and ge. sanguinis, all strains showed the same groesl spacer length (8 bp), and sequence identities within species were >97.8% for groes and >96.1% for groel. however, higher intraspecies heterogeneity was observed in ge. haemolysans. phylogenetic analysis of groel sequences separated the 6 isolates of ge. haemolysans into two subgroups. among these isolates, three isolates with the same groesl spacer region length (45 bp) clustered together but were distant from the atcc reference strain (with a spacer length of 8 bp). the remaining three isolates, with a spacer length of 50 or 8 bp, clustered together. although 16s rrna gene sequence analysis did not provide  enough discrimination for the 6 ge. haemolysans isolates, rpob gene sequence analysis supported the subgrouping. based on the obtained groesl sequences, we developed a multiplex pcr that enables simple, rapid, and accurate identification of abiotrophia, granulicatella, and gemella at the genus level. this assay would  be helpful for identifying these fastidious and slow-growing organisms in clinical laboratories.

TI  == helcococcus ovis, an emerging pathogen in bovine valvular endocarditis.
AB  == the initial isolation of helcococcus ovis from a valvular thrombus prompted us to investigate the prevalence of this bacterium in bovine valvular endocarditis. specimens from 55 affected hearts were examined by culture using columbia blood agar and cross streaking the inoculated plate with a staphylococcus aureus strain. as confirmed by 16s rrna gene sequencing, h. ovis was isolated with an unexpectedly high frequency of 33%, predominantly as heavy growth and pure culture. the majority of h. ovis isolates showed distinct satellitism around s. aureus and pyridoxal dependency, resembling "nutritionally variant streptococci"  (now assigned to the genera abiotrophia and granulicatella). using the api rapid  id 32 strep, api zym, and rosco diatabs systems, incongruent results were obtained for alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and leucine aminopeptidase activities. based on the satellitism/pyridoxal dependency; hemolysis on blood agar; the api rapid id 32 strep results for arginine dihydrolase, alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and pyroglutamic acid arylamidase activities; hippurate hydrolysis; and acidification of sucrose, a scheme for the identification of h. ovis and its differentiation from other members of the helcococcus genus and the pyridoxal-dependent species abiotrophia defectiva, granulicatella adiacens, and granulicatella elegans is proposed. by establishing specific fluorescence in situ hybridization, large h. ovis aggregates were specifically detected within the fibrinous exudate of the valvular thrombi. our results demonstrate for the first time that h. ovis represents an emerging pathogen in bovine valvular endocarditis that is frequently isolated if appropriate culture conditions are used.

TI  == characterization of the bacteriolytic activity of nutritionally variant streptococci.
AB  == the bacteriolytic activity of nutritionally variant streptococci (nvs), fastidious microaerophilic bacteria, which are members of the genera abiotrophia  and granulicatella, was characterized in a renaturating sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. bacteriolytic profiles appeared quite different for the three species of nvs examined. granulicatella adiacens or abiotrophia defectiva each presented at least seven lytic bands, four of which were in common, while the other three were species-specific, whereas granulicatella elegans showed six  bands, which were overlapping with the g. adiacens bands. four lytic bands were identified for enzymatic activity; d-alanyl-l-lysine hydrolase, endo-n-acetylglucosaminidase, endoacetylmuramidase, d-glutamyl-l-lysine hydrolase and acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase activities could be defined. the bacteriolytic enzymes were purified and characterized for the kinetics of production during growth, autolytic activity, temperature and ph stability.

TI  == granulicatella and abiotrophia species from human clinical specimens.
AB  == one hundred one isolates of nutritionally variant streptococci from 97 patients were phenotypically characterized and compared with the type strains of granulicatella adiacens (formerly abiotrophia adiacens) (atcc 49175(t)) abiotrophia defectiva (atcc 49176(t)), and granulicatella elegans (formerly abiotrophia elegans) (dsm 11693(t)). of the isolates, 55 and 43 resembled g. adiacens and a. defectiva, respectively, while 3 strains resembled g. elegans. phenotypic characteristics useful in differentiating between species within the genera granulicatella and abiotrophia (g. adiacens, g. elegans, granulicatella balaenopterae, and a. defectiva) were production of alpha- and beta-galactosidase; production of beta-glucuronidase; hippurate hydrolysis; arginine dihydrolase activity; and acid production from trehalose, sucrose, pullulan, and tagatose. from the reports submitted with the specimens, the clinical diagnosis was endocarditis in 58% of patients and septicemia or bacteremia in 26% of patients.

TI  == serological properties of abiotrophia and granulicatella species (nutritionally variant streptococci).
AB  == serological variations were examined among 12 type or reference strains and 91 oral isolates of vitamin b6-dependent abiotrophia and granulicatella spp. rabbits were immunized with whole cells of 12 selected strains and 10 typing antisera were obtained, which were unreactive with the lancefield group a to g antigen preparations. the reactivity of the antisera and autoclaved cell surface antigen  extracts was tested by double diffusion in agar gel and a capillary precipitin test. these typing antisera categorized all abiotrophia defectiva strains, all except one granulicatella elegans strain, three-quarters of the granulicatella adiacens, and half of the granulicatella paraadiacens into 8 serotypes and 2 subserotypes. the granulicatella balaenopterae type strain was unserotypable. all a. defectiva strains were serotype i, some of which were divided into subserotype i-1 and/or i-5. the g. adiacens strains generally belonged to serotype ii or iii, and the g. paraadiacens strains to serotype iv, v or vi. all g. adiacens or g. paraadiacens serotype ii strains were also subserotype i-5. the g. elegans strains were serotype vii or viii. these abiotrophia and granulicatella serotypes were undetectable among 33 strains of the other 11 species including the bacteriolytic enzyme-producing but vitamin b6-independent strains of streptococcus, enterococcus, dolosigranulum and aerococcus. the proposed serotyping system for abiotrophia and granulicatella spp. would be helpful in the identification and classification of these unique coccal isolates in ecological and epidemiological studies.

TI  == the genus abiotrophia (kawamura et al.) is not monophyletic: proposal of granulicatella gen. nov., granulicatella adiacens comb. nov., granulicatella elegans comb. nov. and granulicatella balaenopterae comb. nov.
AB  == the genus abiotrophia currently includes four species, abiotrophia defectiva, abiotrophia adiacens, abiotrophia balaenopterae and abiotrophia elegans. recent 16s rrna gene sequencing studies have demonstrated that the genus is not monophyletic and is in need of taxonomic revision. phylogenetically, the genus abiotrophia consists of two distinct lines, a. defectiva, the type species of the genus, and a robust group consisting of a. adiacens, a. balaenopterae and a. elegans. therefore, it is formally proposed that the genus abiotrophia should be  restricted to a. defectiva and that a. adiacens, a. balaenopterae and a. elegans  should be reclassified in a new genus, granulicatella, as granulicatella adiacens comb. nov., granulicatella balaenopterae comb. nov. and granulicatella elegans comb. nov.
