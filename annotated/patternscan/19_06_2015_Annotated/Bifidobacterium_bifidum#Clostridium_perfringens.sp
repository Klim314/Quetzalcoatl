TI  == effects of non-fermented and fermented soybean milk intake on faecal microbiota and faecal metabolites in humans.
AB  == the effects of non-fermented soybean milk (nfsm) and fermented soybean milk (fsm) intake on the faecal microbiota and metabolic activities in 10 healthy volunteers were investigated. soybean oligosaccharides, raffinose and stachyose were utilized by bifidobacteria except for bifidobacterium bifidum, but most strains of escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens could not use them. during the dietary administration of fsm, the number of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the faeces increased (p < 0.05), and clostridia decreased (p < 0.05). moreover, the concentrations of faecal sulphide were decreased (p < 0.01) in the intake of  fsm. during the dietary administration of nfsm, the number of bifidobacteria tended to increase. these results indicate that the consumption of soybean milk,  especially fsm, is related to improvement of the intestinal environment.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

TI  == selective growth-inhibiting effects of compounds identified in tabebuia impetiginosa inner bark on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin,  menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. these two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli at 100  microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the c-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.

TI  == growth responses of cassia obtusifolia toward human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == 1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone (1) was isolated from the seed of cassia obtusifolia through bioassay-guided fractionation. 1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone strongly inhibited the growth of clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli. structure-activity relationship revealed that 1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone (2) and  1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone (3) had strong growth-inhibition against c. perfringens. in growth-promoting activity, 1,2-, 1,4-, and 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinones exhibited strong growth-promoting activity to bifidobacterium bifidum.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == encapsulated bifidobacterium bifidum potentiates intestinal iga production.
AB  == we asked whether bifidobacterium bifidum regulates the synthesis of iga by mucosal lymphoid cells. b. bifidum alone, but not clostridium perfringens, significantly induced total iga and igm synthesis by both mesenteric lymph nodes  (mln) and peyer's patch (pp) cells. we, further, investigated the mucosal antibody production following peroral administration of b. bifidum to mice. ingested b. bifidum significantly increased the number of ig (igm, igg, and iga)  secreting cells in the culture of both mln and spleen cells. nonetheless, b. bifidum itself does not induce the own specific antibody responses, implying that b. bifidum does not provoke unnecessary immune reaction. subsequently, it was found that encapsulation of b. bifidum further augments the total iga production  in the culture of both mln and spleen cells. finally, we found that the immuno-stimulating activity of b. bifidum is due to its cellular components but not due to any actively secreting component(s) from bacteria.

TI  == selective responses of three ginkgo biloba leaf-derived constituents on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the selective responses of ginkgo biloba leaf-derived materials against six intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, and quercetin. the components of g. biloba leaves were characterized as kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside), kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6'  "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) by spectroscopic analysis. the growth  responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. at 2 mg/disk, kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside showed a clear inhibitory effect on escherichia coli. at 0.5 mg/disk, quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) showed a strong activity against c. perfringens, but weak activity was exhibited by kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) against c. perfringens and kaempferol  3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside against e. coli. no inhibition was observed from treatments conducted with bilobalide, ginkgolides a  and b, kaempferol, or quercetin. furthermore, these isolated compounds did not inhibit bifidobacterium bifidum, b. longum, b. adolescentis, or lactobacillus acidophilus.

TI  == adhesive property of bifidobacterium lactis lkm512 and predominant bacteria of intestinal microflora to human intestinal mucin.
AB  == the adhesive property to the intestinal mucin of bifidobacterium lactis lkm512, b. longum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus acidophilus were examined. adhesive rate of lkm512 to the mucin was significantly (p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001) stronger than the other strains from 2 to 100 time. though the adhesive property  of many strains was almost same to the mucin of 20-year-old and 50-year-old generations, in case of 4-month-old was different. adhesive inhibitory effect of  c. perfringens to the mucin by lkm512 was examined. under the condition that lkm512 was 108/ml and that c. perfringens was 106/ml, adhesion of c. perfringens  to the mucin was inhibited at 99.6%, when lkm512 adhered in advance. there was the strong inhibition of adhesion at 74.0%, when c. perfringens adhered to mucin  in advance. thus, lkm512 can inhibit the adhesion of harmful bacteria to the intestinal mucin, the possibility of using as a probiotic strain has to be verified.

TI  == selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from pulsatilla cernua root.
AB  == among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an  impregnated paper disk method. the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity  against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. weak  or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis,  b. longum, or l. acidophilus. cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.

TI  == cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
AB  == the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.

TI  == bifidobacterium bifidum exhibits a lipopolysaccharide-like mitogenic activity for murine b lymphocytes.
AB  == to determine the role of bifidobacteria in the systemic and mucosal antibody response, we examined the direct modulatory effect of bifidobacteria on the synthesis of antibodies by murine spleen b cells. whole spleen b cells were cultured with bifidobacterium bifidum or clostridium perfringens (welch's bacilli, negative control), and antibody synthesis was measured by elisa and enzyme-linked immunospot assay. the b. bifidum, but not c. perfringens, substantially increased total secretion of major immunoglobulin (ig) isotypes and the number of iga-secreting cells. in addition, b. bifidum increased proliferation of spleen cells by threefold, and c. perfringens had little to diminishing effect on the cells. these results indicate that b. bifidum increased ig synthesis through its mitogenic influence on b cells. further, b. bifidum induced spleen b cells to be reactive to transforming growth factor-beta 1 and interleukin-5 and resulted in increased surface iga expression (approximately threefold) and total iga production (> 20-fold) but not increased production of igm and igg2a isotypes. together, these studies indicate that b. bifidum can act  as a lipopolysaccharide-like polyclonal activator for b cells. furthermore, that  bifidobacteria enable b cells to respond to transforming growth factor-beta 1 and interleukin-5 for the iga production has important implications for the primary defense against pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == the intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  == bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. in infants delivered by caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. the first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which  remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. among them, staphylococcus,  enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from  the newborn faecal flora at birth. facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by bifidobacterium sp. clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a caesarean section. clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp. the impact of caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. in humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. formula feeding seems  to promote implantation and persistence of clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of c. difficile in newborns.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == modulation of clostridium perfringens intestinal colonization in infants delivered by caesarean section.
AB  == the colonization by clostridium perfringens was investigated in 19 infants delivered by caesarean section during the two first weeks of life. the pattern of c. perfringens colonization depended upon the feeding. breast feeding led to the  repression of c. perfringens, whereas bottle feeding allowed its maintenance. on  the contrary, bifidobacterium bifidum growth was favoured by breast feeding. however, in one breast-fed infant, b. bifidum was never isolated and c. perfringens decreased. breast feeding was able to directly modulate c. perfringens numbers. in fact, b. bifidum also had an effect, as demonstrated by the lower mean counts of c. perfringens, in bottle-fed infants carrying the bifidobacteria flora (p = 0.05). none of the bifidobacteria investigated in this  study led to the same decrease.

TI  == [h-nmr spectroscopy. specificity of microbial sialidases against complex substrates].
AB  == the specificities of one viral and five bacterial sialidases were investigated by 1h-nmr-spectroscopy with substrates or substrate mixtures containing two sialic acid residues of different linkage types. this technique allows - in contrast to  the methods used before - the simultaneous determination of the rates of hydrolysis of both neuac linkages in a single experiment. the substrate specificities of the enzymes are discussed on the basis of the relation of the rate constants k/k'. the data obtained are more exact and more informative than those of separate experiments as reported previously. among the enzymes investigated, i.e. sialidases of fowl plague virus (fpv = vkh), clostridium perfringens (cp), vibrio cholerae (vc), bifidobacterium bifidum var. pennsylvanicum (bbif), bifidobacterium lactentis (blac), and arthrobacter ureafaciens (au), the activity of the viral sialidase vkh shows the highest, the  activities of the bifidobacterium sialidases the lowest dependence on the nature  and on the linkage type of the different substrates. all sialidases preferentially cleave the neuac alpha 2-3-gal linkage with the exception of the enzyme of arthrobacter ureafaciens (au) which shows a higher affinity to alpha 2-6 linkages. however, this does not apply to the side-arm-linked neuac alpha 2-6 structure in neuac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-3 (neuac alpha 2-6)-glcnac beta 1-3gal beta 1-4glc (substrate b). this substrate in generally cleaved very slowly and is hardly affected by the viral enzyme. after the alpha 2-3 linkage, the alpha 2-8 bond in neuac alpha 2-8 neuac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-4glc(substrate a) is most susceptible for the sialidases vkh, cp and vc. an elongation of the carbohydrate  chain (substrate d) is accompanied by a reduction of the rate of cleavage for all enzymes. the experiments with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, fetuin, and with the glycopeptides obtained by proteolytic degradation of the latter, revealed the same specificity towards the alpha 2-3 and the alpha 2-6 linkages as the oligosaccharides. influenced by the chemical nature and the size of the substrate, neuac is released from the native alpha 1-acid glycoprotein more quickly than from the corresponding glycopeptide. all sialidases investigated so  far are strictly exo-enzymes as could be demonstrated by the cleavage of neuac alpha 2-8 neuac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-4glc (substrate a).

AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

TI  == considerations on the value of freeze-etching technique in studying the ultrastructure of some anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == samples from periodic cultures of clostridium perfringens, clostridium oedematiens, clostridium tetani and bifidobacterium bifidum grown in liquid nutrient media were studied after freeze-fracturing and etching without pretreatment by means of chemical agents including cryo-protectants. subunits in  the cell all of cl. tetani and differences in the distribution of globular particles in the plasma membrane of the investigated bacteria are revealed.
