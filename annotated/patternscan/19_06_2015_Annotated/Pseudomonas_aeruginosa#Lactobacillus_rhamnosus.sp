TI  == evaluation of synergistic interactions between cell-free supernatant of lactobacillus strains and amikacin and genetamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background: the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the treatment of infectious  diseases can increase the development of antibiotic resistance. therefore, there  is a big demand for new sources of antimicrobial agents and alternative treatments for reduction of antibiotic dosage required to decrease the associated side effects. objectives: in this study, the synergistic action of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cell-free supernatant (cfs) of probiotic (lactobacillus rahmnosus and l. casei) against pseudomonas aeruginosa ptcc 1430 was evaluated. materials and methods: a growth medium for culturing of probiotic bacteria was separated by centrifugation. the antimicrobial effects of cfs of probiotic bacteria were evaluated using the agar well diffusion assay. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were evaluated using the micro dilution method. finally, an interaction between cfs and amikacin or gentamicin against p. aeruginosa ptcc 1430 was examined through the checkerboard method and fractional inhibitory concentration (fic). furthermore, cfss from lactobacillus strains were analyzed by reversed phase hplc (rp-hplc) for antimicrobial compounds. results: the results showed a significant effect of  cfs on the growth of p. aeruginosa. the mic and mbc of cfs from l. casei were 62.5 microlml while the mic and mbc of cfs from l. rhamnosus were 62.5 mulml and  125 mulml, respectively. using the fic indices, synergistic interactions were observed in combination of cfs and antibiotics. fractional inhibitory concentration indices of cfs from l. casei and aminoglycoside antibiotics were 0.124 and 0.312 while fic indices of cfs from l. rhamnosus and aminoglycoside antibiotics were 0.124 and 0.56, respectively showing a synergism effect. the results of rp-hplc showed that cfs of lactobacillus strains contained acetic acid, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). conclusions: our findings indicate that probiotic bacterial strains of lactobacillus have a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of p. aeruginosa ptcc 1430. the antimicrobial potency of this combination can be useful for designing and developing alternative therapeutic strategies against p. aeruginosa infections.

TI  == improved in vitro assay for determining the mucin adherence of bacteria sensitive to triton x-100 treatment.
AB  == mucin-associated microbiota are in relatively close contact with the intestinal epithelium and may thus have a more pronounced effect on host health. we have previously developed a simple mucin agar assay to simulate initial mucus colonization by intestinal microbial communities. adherence of microbiota was estimated using flow cytometry after detachment with triton x-100. in this study, the effect of this detergent on the cultivability of both virulent and commensal  strains was investigated. mucin attachment of selected strains was evaluated using the mucin adhesion assay. bacteria were dislodged from the mucin surface by incubation with triton or from the whole mucin agar layer using a stomacher. mechanical extraction resulted in 1.24 +/- 0.42, 2.69 +/- 0.44, and 1.56 +/- 0.85 log cfu/ml higher plate counts of lactobacillus rhamnosus, bacillus cereus, and escherichia coli strains, respectively, than the chemical method. the sensitivity of bacteria to triton varied among microbial species and strains. among others, triton inhibited the growth of salmonella enterica lmg 10396 and pseudomonas aeruginosa lmg 8029 on laboratory media, although these bacteria maintained their viability during this treatment. only gram-positive strains, enterococcus hirae lmg 6399 and l. rhamnosus gg, were not affected by this detergent. therefore, the mechanical method is recommended for the extraction of mucin-adhered bacteria that are sensitive to triton, especially when followed by traditional cultivation techniques. however, this approach can also be recommended for strains that are not affected by this detergent, because it resulted in higher recovery of adhered l. rhamnosus gg compared to the chemical extraction.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg improves outcome in experimental pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia: potential role of regulatory t cells.
AB  == introduction: recent clinical trials show lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) administration in critical illness has the potential to reduce nosocomial infections and improve clinical outcome. however, the mechanism(s) of lgg-mediated benefit following illness and injury remain elusive. objective: the  aim of this study was to determine the effect of lgg treatment on survival and lung injury in a mouse model of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced pneumonia. as increased t regulatory (treg) cell numbers have been shown to improve outcome in  experimental pneumonia, we examined the potential role of treg cells in probiotic-mediated benefit. methods: fvb/n mice were subjected to intratracheal injection of either p. aeruginosa or saline and received lgg or vehicle immediately before procedure. t regulatory cell responses in the lung were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and flow cytometry. results: mice treated with lgg had significantly improved 7-day survival (p < 0.01) compared with saline-treated control pneumonia mice (55% lgg vs. 14% control). the survival advantage was associated with reduced bacterial counts in  bronchoalveolar lavage and with decreased markers of the systemic inflammatory response and improved lung pathology in the probiotic group. probiotic treatment  influenced immune response in the lungs of mice with pneumonia as demonstrated by increased levels of treg cell marker foxp3. conclusions: these data demonstrate that early administration of lgg improves outcome following p. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia. an effect of lgg on treg cells may play a role in this protection.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  == the objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  lactobacillus spp. (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus bulgaricus and lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. four types of beads, containing entrapped (e), surface and entrapped (es), surface (s) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (c(es)) were prepared and physically characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization,  freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant enterococcus faecalis, vim-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing pseudomonas aeruginosa and ctx-m-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. alginate beads in which lactobacilli  proliferated to the beads surface (es and c(es)) differed significantly from the  other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (es) resulted  in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. the viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.

TI  == stretching polysaccharides on live cells using single molecule force spectroscopy.
AB  == the knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying the adhesive and mechanical properties of cell surface-associated molecules is a key to understanding their functions. in this context, single-molecule force spectroscopy (smfs) has recently offered new opportunities for probing the adhesion and mechanics of polysaccharides and proteins on live cells. here we present a protocol that we have used to analyze polysaccharide chains of different nature on the bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. we describe procedures (i) for functionalizing atomic force microscopy (afm) tips with pseudomonas aeruginosa-i or concanavalin a lectins, (ii) for stretching specific polysaccharide molecules on live bacteria using smfs with lectin tips and (iii) for mapping the localization, adhesion and  extension of individual polysaccharide chains. we also discuss data treatment, emphasizing how to gain insight into the elasticity of the stretched macromolecules using the extended freely jointed chain model. even though the presented protocol is for l. rhamnosus, it can be easily modified for other cell  types. for users having expertise in the field, the entire protocol can be completed in about 5 d.

TI  == oral probiotic and prevention of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in intensive care unit patients.
AB  == introduction: preventing carriage of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms from  the aerodigestive tract is an infection control strategy used to reduce the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units. however, antibiotic use in selective decontamination protocols is controversial. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oral administration of a probiotic, namely lactobacillus, on gastric and respiratory tract colonization/infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. our hypothesis was that an indigenous flora should exhibit a protective effect against secondary colonization. methods: we conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study between march 2003 and october 2004 in a 17-bed intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in clermont-ferrand, france. consecutive patients with a unit stay of longer than 48 hours were included, 106  in the placebo group and 102 in the probiotic group. through a nasogastric feeding tube, patients received either 109 colony-forming units unity forming colony of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus or placebo twice daily, from the third day after admission to discharge. digestive tract carriage of p. aeruginosa was monitored by cultures of gastric aspirates at admission, once a week thereafter and on discharge. in addition, bacteriological analyses of respiratory tract specimens were conducted to determine patient infectious status. results: the occurrence of p. aeruginosa respiratory colonization and/or infection was significantly delayed in the probiotic group, with a difference in median delay to acquisition of 11 days versus 50 days (p = 0.01), and a nonacquisition expectancy mean of 69 days versus 77 days (p = 0.01). the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to p. aeruginosa in the patients receiving the probiotic was less frequent, although not significantly reduced, in patients  in the probiotic group (2.9%) compared with those in the placebo group (7.5%). after multivariate cox proportional hazards modelling, the absence of probiotic treatment increased the risk for p. aeruginosa colonization in respiratory tract  (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.2, 95% confidence interval - 1.1 to 9.1). conclusion:  in this pilot study, oral administration of a probiotic delayed respiratory tract colonization/infection by p. aeruginosa. trial registration: the trial registration number for this study is nct00604110.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.
