TI  == is there interaction between gut microbial profile and cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease patients?
AB  == aim: to evaluate the gut microbial profile in chronic kidney disease (ckd) patients and evaluate the possible relationship with inflammation and cardiovascular risk. patients & methods: markers inflammation plasma and bacterial community profile (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) were analyzed. results: the average number of bands was not different in healthy individuals and ckd patients. the number of bands was negatively associated with  plasma levels of vcam-1 in patients. flavobacteriaceae bacterium and listeria monocytogenes were found in patients and lachnospiraceae bacterium and butyrivibrio crossotus in healthy individuals. conclusion: although ckd patients  did not present altered gut microbial profile, the sequencing of bands suggested  a different microbiota between groups. the result suggests a possible relationship between gut microbiota and cardiovascular risk in ckd patients.
