TI  == comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  == in this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (vb) and through cesarean section (cb) were investigated using culture-independent 16s rdna cloning and sequencing approach. the results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of vb infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart cb infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants  delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. the most abundant bacterial species present in vb infants were acinetobacter sp., bifidobacterium sp. and staphylococcus sp. however, cb infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with citrobacter sp., escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. the intestinal  microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of bifidobacteria species. an interesting finding of  our study was recovery of large number of acinetobacter sp. consisting of acinetobacter pittii (former acinetobacter genomic species 3), acinetobacter junii and acinetobacter baumannii in the vb infants clone library. among these, acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.

TI  == nosocomial infections and multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms in the pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  == nosocomial infections in pediatric intensive care units (picus) caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms are increasing. this review attempts to report on significant findings in the current literature related to nosocomial infections in picu settings with an international perspective. the types of nosocomial infections are addressed, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections and post-surgical wound infections. a review of emerging resistant bacterial pathogens includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative organisms, klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains and multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii. basic and enhanced infection control methods for the management and control of multidrug-resistant organisms are also summarized with  an emphasis on prevention.
