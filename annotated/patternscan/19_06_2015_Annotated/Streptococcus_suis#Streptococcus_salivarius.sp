TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (htp) family in streptococcus.
AB  == the histidine triad proteins (htps), also known as pht proteins in streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. although many studies have revealed the importance of htps in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. in this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. by further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. first, htp genes originated earlier than the streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the bovis, mutans and salivarius groups. second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp i and htp ii. although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in streptococcus  suis, htp ii members are distinct from htp i due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the c-terminus. finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. specifically, the regions outside the htp domains are under strong positive selection. this distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == emergence of a cell wall protease in the streptococcus thermophilus population.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is perceived as a recently emerged food bacterium that evolved from a commensal ancestor by loss and gain of functions. here, we provide data allowing a better understanding of this evolutionary scheme. a multilocus sequence typing approach that we developed showed that s. thermophilus diverges significantly from its potential ancestors of the salivarius group and displays a low level of allelic variability, confirming its likely recent emergence. an analysis of the origin and dissemination of the prts gene was carried out within  this evolutionary scheme. this gene encodes a protease that allows better growth  in milk by facilitating casein breakdown to supply amino acids. the s. thermophilus protease exhibits 95% identity to the animal streptococcus suis protein prts. genomic analysis showed that prts is part of an island flanked by two tandem insertion sequence elements and containing three other genes which present the best identities and synteny with the s. suis genome. these data indicate a potential origin for this "ecological" island in a species closely related to s. suis. the analysis of the distribution of the prts gene in s. thermophilus showed that the gene is infrequent in historical collections but frequent in recent industrial ones. moreover, this "ecological" island conferring an important metabolic trait for milk adaptation appears to have disseminated by  lateral transfer in the s. thermophilus population. taken together, these data support an evolutionary scheme of s. thermophilus where gene acquisition and selection by food producers are determining factors. the source and impact of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer on the physiology and safety of strains should be addressed.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == salk/salr, a two-component signal transduction system, is essential for full virulence of highly invasive streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  == background: streptococcus suis serotype 2 (s. suis 2, ss2) has evolved into a highly infectious entity, which caused the two recent large-scale outbreaks of human ss2 epidemic in china, and is characterized by a toxic shock-like syndrome. however, the molecular pathogenesis of this new emerging pathogen is still poorly understood. methodology/principal findings: 89k is a newly predicted pathogenicity island (pai) which is specific to chinese epidemic strains isolated from these two ss2 outbreaks. further bioinformatics analysis revealed a unique two-component signal transduction system (tcsts) located in the candidate 89k pai, which is orthologous to the salk/salr regulatory system of streptococcus salivarius. knockout of salkr eliminated the lethality of ss2 in experimental infection of piglets. functional complementation of salkr into the isogenic mutant deltasalkr restored its soaring pathogenicity. colonization experiments showed that the deltasalkr mutant could not colonize any susceptible tissue of piglets when administered alone. bactericidal assays demonstrated that resistance of the mutant to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn)-mediated killing was greatly decreased. expression microarray analysis exhibited a transcription profile alteration of 26 various genes down-regulated in the deltasalkr mutant. conclusions/significance: these findings suggest that salk/salr is requisite for  the full virulence of ethnic chinese isolates of highly pathogenic ss2, thus providing experimental evidence for the validity of this bioinformatically predicted pai.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pmv158 family.
AB  == twenty-two streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. fifteen s. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using dna homology. ten plasmids were classified within group a and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced s. thermophilus plasmids. three plasmids (group b) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups c and d). single-stranded dna was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups a, c, and d, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. the only plasmid of group c, named psmq172, was further characterized. this 4230-bp plasmid replicates in escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. comparisons with databases showed that psmq172 was related to pmv158 of streptococcus agalactiae and to pssu1 of streptococcus suis. these results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == surface location of hpr, a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococcus suis.
AB  == hpr is a low-molecular-mass phosphocarrier protein of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (pep): sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) found in the cytoplasm or associated with the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. treatment of streptococcus suis cells with a sorvall omnimixer, a technique used  to extract cell surface components, resulted in the extraction of a major protein with a molecular mass of 9 kda. several lines of evidence suggested that this protein was hpr: (i) the s. suis protein showed homology over the first 35 n-terminal amino acid residues with the hprs of streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mutans, including the signature sequence for the site of pep-dependent phosphorylation; (ii) it cross-reacted with the s. salivarius anti-hpr antibody preparation; (iii) it could be phosphorylated by enzyme i at the expense of pep, and by a membrane-associated kinase at the expense of atp; and (iv) it possessed phosphocarrier activity when used as a source of hpr in an  in vitro pts assay. the data suggested that a portion of the cellular hpr is associated with the external cell surface in s. suis, a result that was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy. the cellular hpr of s. suis consisted of two forms that could be distinguished by the presence or the absence of the n-terminal methionine. amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the cell-surface-associated hpr of s. suis lacked the n-terminal methionine residue.

TI  == intrageneric structure of streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rrna sequences.
AB  == the partial 16s rrna sequences of 24 streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. a comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. the clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. the pyogenic group was extended to include streptococcus agalactiae, s. parauberis, s. porcinus, and s. uberis. four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, and s. oralis. some species (e.g., s. suis and s. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.

TI  == cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  == in recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. in the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (omniserum). representatives of the following species were included: streptococcus bovis, s. equinus, s. intermedius, s. lactis, s. milleri, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. suis, and aerococcus viridans. serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. fifteen (12%) of the strains  gave positive reactions by all three methods. positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. altogether 84 (68%)  strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. these findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
