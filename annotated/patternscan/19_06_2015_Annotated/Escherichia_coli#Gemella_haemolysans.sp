TI  == horizontal transfer of the immunoglobulin a1 protease gene (iga) from streptococcus to gemella haemolysans.
AB  == bacterial iga1 proteases share the ability to cleave human iga1 at the hinge region. nature has developed this trait along at least five independent evolutionary lineages. to obtain further insight into the phylogeny and function  of iga1 proteases, the nucleotide sequence of the iga gene that encodes the iga1  protease was determined from two streptococcus mitis strains and one gemella haemolysans strain. heterologous expression in escherichia coli confirmed that the genes encode human iga1-cleaving activity. iga1 proteases from streptococcus  and g. haemolysans shared structural features, including a motif typical for zinc-dependent metalloproteases of clan ma(e) family m26 and an n-terminal signal sequence followed by an lpxtg cell-wall-anchor motif and two putative membrane-spanning domains. in addition, they all harboured a repeat region preceding the active site of the protease. in the streptococcal iga1 proteases, a g5 domain, which has been suggested to bind n-acetylglucosamine, was identified.  conservation of these structures in otherwise diverse proteases suggests that they are essential to the biological function of the enzyme. the phylogenetic distribution of homologous iga genes and conservation of gene order in the iga gene region in different streptococcus species, combined with the sequence homologies, strongly suggest that the iga gene is more ancient in streptococcus than in g. haemolysans, and therefore that the iga1 protease gene was transferred from streptococcus to g. haemolysans.

TI  == genetic relationships among neisseria species assessed by comparative enzyme electrophoresis.
AB  == the electrophoretic mobilities of 12 enzymes from 19 neisseria species (including 6 strains of n. perflava), gemella haemolysans, escherichia coli and branhamella  catarrhalis were characterized by polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. all strains and species tested exhibited qualitatively different zymogram patterns. species and strain relationships were quantified by pairwise comparisons of all 12 enzyme systems to obtain similarity indices; these data were subjected to numerical clustering methods to obtain groups and a phenogram. the electrophoretic classification compared favourably with those obtained by other criteria. in addition, the quantitative clustering data indicated that n. ovis and n. caviae are sufficiently different from the other neisseria species to warrant their separation into a distinct group. these two species also lacked the characteristic nadph-diaphorase zymogram pattern found in all the other neisseria species. intra-species similarity indices were generally greater than the inter-species index values. however, certain species such as n. meningitidis and  n. gonorrhoeae had similarity index values in the range of inter-strain index values.
