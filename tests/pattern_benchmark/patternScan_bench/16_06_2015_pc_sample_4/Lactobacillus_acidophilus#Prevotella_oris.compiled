TI  - Antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  - Self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt L-Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. A single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (Excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. One-Up BondF, Prompt L-Pop and Excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. The bonding agents of Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond and Imperva FL Bond were unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii and Actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  - Past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. The antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems Single Bond, Prime&Bond NT, and Excite were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus intermedius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella oris, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Clostridium ramosum with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Prime&Bond NT showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to Single Bond, whereas EX produced no inhibitory effect on Porphyromonas endodontalis, although the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to Streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. The variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.
