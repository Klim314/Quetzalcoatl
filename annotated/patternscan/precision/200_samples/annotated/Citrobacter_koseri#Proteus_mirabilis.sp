TI == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

TI == identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in lebanese patients.
AB == staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. we conducted a study of 32 lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. the presence or absence of s aureus enterotoxin a, b, c, and d (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. a total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. of these, only 3 (8.8%) were s aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin b). moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. our results could not confirm that s aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the lebanese group studied.

TI == chromosomally encoded blacmy-2 located on a novel sxt/r391-related integrating conjugative element in a proteus mirabilis clinical isolate.
AB == integrating conjugative elements (ices) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. although sxt/r391-related ices, originally demonstrated in vibrio cholerae o139 isolates, have become prevalent among v. cholerae isolates in asia, the prevalence of the ices among gram-negative bacteria other than vibrio spp. remains unknown. in addition, sxt/r391-related ices carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. here we carried out a genetic analysis of a cefoxitin-resistant proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, tum4660, which revealed the presence of a novel sxt/r391-related ice, icepmijpn1. icepmijpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of r391 and carried xis and int genes completely identical to those of r391, while an is10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(cmy-2) was integrated into the ice. a nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of isecp1 was located upstream of the bla(cmy-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(cmy-2) in earlier studies were also present. furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in icepmijpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in sxt(mo10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in p. mirabilis atcc 29906, respectively. icepmijpn1 was successfully transferred to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. these observations suggest that ices may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ices, including sxt/r391-related ices.

TI == increased serum iga and igm against lps of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of cfs and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB == there is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. the present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of iga and igm to lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei; pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsiella pneumoniae in cfs patients, patients with partial cfs and normal controls. we found that the prevalences and median values for serum iga against the lps of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with cfs than in normal volunteers and patients with partial cfs. serum iga levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the fibrofatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. the results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of cfs and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the lps of gram-negative enterobacteria. it is suggested that all patients with cfs should be checked by means of the iga panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.

TI == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI == fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar--a differential medium for enteric bacteria.
AB == fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar (febla), a new differential medium for enteric bacteria was developed and evaluated for its ability to grow and differentiate lactose fermenters (lf) from non-lactose fermenters (nlf) in comparison with macconkeys agar. performance of febla was at par with the latter. on febla medium, the contrast between lf and nlf colonies was pronounced and klebsiella pneumoniae produced more mucoid colonies than on macconkeys agar (hi media). unlike macconkeys agar, a 24 h culture of k. pneumoniae cells on febla were longer and thicker with abundant capsular material around the bacilli. escherichia coli produced long and thick cells but only after 48h. no change in cell morphology was evident with regard to salmonella typhi, s. paratyphi a, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter koseri and acinetobacter baumannii. performance of the medium was controlled using e. coli and s. flexneri. febla is simple, cost effective and may be a suitable alternative in the preliminary identification of enteric bacteria.

TI == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mic90 of mepm for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. mepm were active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (ipm) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (87.9%). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in proteus mirabilis. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.

TI == regional variation in the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates in the asia-pacific region (sentry 1998-2002).
AB == we examined the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter koseri, and salmonella spp. that were isolated as part of the sentry asia-pacific surveillance program between 1998 and 2002. during the study period, a total of 6,388 strains were gathered from 17 medical centers in 7 countries and examined for esbl production and hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme. high rates of confirmed esbl-producing isolates were found in k. pneumoniae strains from singapore (35.6%), followed by those from mainland china (30.7%), south africa (28.1%), and the philippines (21.9%), whereas the rates were less than 10% in japan and australia. esbl-producing e. coli strains were also prominent in mainland china (24.5%), hong kong (14.3%), and singapore (11.3%). esbl-producing k. oxytoca were common in the philippines (38.5%), singapore (33.3%), and china (30.0%). hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme was common in australia and japan. p. mirabilis strains from singapore produced esbl (17.9%) despite the low prevalence (0-8.1%) in other countries. few esbl-producing c. koseri and salmonella spp. strains were found in japan, singapore, taiwan, and south africa. although there was variation among countries in substrate preference, ceftazidime was more likely to detect presumptive esbl phenotype in k. pneumoniae and aztreonam more likely in e. coli, whereas ceftriaxone was the best substrate for the confirmation of esbl production. esbl-producing strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. imipenem retained activity against all esbl-producing strains. organisms expressing esbls are widely distributed in the asia-pacific region, although prevalence rates vary significantly.

TI == frequency and diversity of class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in hospitals of the auvergne, france: a 2 year prospective study.
AB == objectives: to evaluate the frequency and diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) produced by enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in one french region. methods: during 2001-2002, all the non-duplicate isolates of p. aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime and of enterobacteriaceae intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime and/or aminoglycosides with an aac(6') i phenotype were collected in nine hospitals of the area. esbl isoelectric points were determined, bla genes were amplified and sequenced and epidemic isolates were genotyped with eric2-pcr. results: esbls were observed in 297 enterobacteriaceae (0.8%). the most frequent were tem-3 like (n=152; 51.2%) and tem-24 (n=115; 38.7%). four new enzymes were observed, tem-112 (pi 5.4), tem-113 (pi 6.3), tem-114 (pi 5.9) and tem-126 (pi 5.4). other tems were tem-8, tem-12, tem-16, tem-19, tem-20, tem-21, tem-29 and tem-71. the other esbls were shv-4, shv-5 and shv-12, ctx-m-1, ctx-m-3, ctx-m-14 and ctx-m-15. in 37 p. aeruginosa (0.7%) only one esbl was observed, per-1. five epidemic strains were detected, serratia marcescens tem-3 and four observed in several hospitals, enterobacter aerogenes tem-24, citrobacter koseri tem-3, proteus mirabilis tem-3 and p. aeruginosa per-1. conclusion: esbl frequency was lower than in 1998, and ctx-m-type frequency higher (2.1% of esbls in 2001, 4.9% in 2002). this long-term survey detected new sporadic enzymes (tem-112, tem-113, tem-114 and tem-126) and interhospital epidemic strains while avoiding any overestimation of esbl frequency that may otherwise have occurred because of acute epidemics.

AB == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

AB == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI == [use of semi-solid diasalm medium for isolation of salmonella enteritidis].
AB == the diagnostic semi-solid salmonella agar (diasalm) was compared with two commercial semi-solid rappaport-vasiliadis media (msrv by oxoid and srva, basis by himedia) using 52 strains of salmonella and 10 strains of interfering gram-negative bacteria. the diagnostic potency for salmonellae was higher in diasalm than in msrv or srva. unlike the rappaport-vasiliadis media, diasalm contains a diagnostic system consisting of lactose, saccharose and bromocresol purple, allowing the differentiation of salmonellae from non-pathogenic gram-negative sugar-fermenting bacteria (tab. i). the semi-solid media were supplemented with 0.0015% nitrofurantoine to recover specifically salmonella enteritidis. eighty percent of strains of the latter serovar were resistant to this chemotherapeutic agent, while all the other serovars were sensitive to it. the use of discs soaked with the monovalent salmonella antiserum h:g,m increased the recovery rate in 95 percent of s. enteritidis strains. compared with the cultures from peptone water, the diameters of the migration zones formed by the positive cultures grown in m-broth were larger by 3 to 5 mm. pure cultures of salmonellae were isolated in 98% of cases from the borders of the migration zones when mixed cultures of salmonellae (a s. enteritidis isolate from a patient, density 10(3) to 1 or 2 cells per drop) and citrobacter koseri or edwardsiella tarda, or proteus mirabilis, or psedomonas aeruginosa (densities > or = 10(3) cells per drop) were inoculated onto diasalm (tab iii).

TI == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime in enterobacteriaceae.
AB == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime (ctx) in eight species of enterobacteriaceae was carried out. one strain of each species was examined. the strains represented their individual species as regards natural susceptibility to ampicillin (a) and carbenicillin (ca). cephalothinase activity of the parental strains and strains selected on the plates with the highest concentration that allowed growth was determined by an ultraviolet assay. the populations of the a-susceptible/ca-susceptible (a-s/ca-s) species, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to ctx. the a-resistant/ca-resistant (a-r/ca-r) species, klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri, were less homogeneous, but in all four mentioned species no increase in cephalothinase activity was observed between the parental strains and the strains selected in the population analysis. the four a-r/ca-s species, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, were heterogeneous. the frequency of ctx-r mutants was approx. 10(-6.5). the ic50 for ctx was 2(7.5)-2(8.5) times higher for the mutants than for the parental strains. the ctx resistance was maintained in subcultures of the strains. all four species had a very high increase in cephalothinase activity from parental strains to the strains selected in the population analysis. only the enzyme of proteus vulgaris was able to hydrolyze ctx.
