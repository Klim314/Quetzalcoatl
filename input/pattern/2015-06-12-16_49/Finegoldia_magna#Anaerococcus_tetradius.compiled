TI  - FAF and SufA: proteins of Finegoldia magna that modulate the antibacterial activity of histones.
AB  - Many bacterial pathogens have developed methods to overcome the defences of the host innate immune system. One such defence is the release of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Histones have been found to function as AMPs, in addition to their main biological function of packaging and organising DNA into nucleosomes. In this study, the Gram-positive anaerobic coccus Finegoldia magna was found to bind histones by Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis. F. magna, which is normally a commensal of the skin and mucous membranes, is also known to act as an opportunistic pathogen and has been isolated from various clinical infection sites. It was found to bind to histones extracted from human skin epidermis through its surface and extracellular adhesion protein FAF. Through FAF binding, F. magna was protected from histone bactericidal activity. Furthermore, the histones were found to be degraded by SufA, a subtilisin-like extracellular serine protease of F. magna. Hence, the results of the present study will give more insight into how F. magna persists both as a commensal organism at the basement membrane of the skin and as an opportunistic pathogen during infection.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - [V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy - new option in septic thoracic surgery].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy is an innovative process for treating chronic wounds that are not optimally accessible to a systemic antibiotic therapy or infected with multi-resistant pathogens. We report on our first experience and applications of V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy in the field of septic thoracic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: V. A. C. INSTILL therapy was used in 11 cases between 11/2009 and 01/2012. Three patients had sternum osteomyelitis (2 MRSA, 1 Finegoldia magna). In 3 patients chronic pleural empyema after lobectomy (1 Streptococcus viridans, 1 mixed infection with MRSA among others) and after pneumectomy (1 MRSA) were detected. In 2 cases there was an acute pleural empyema with extensive phlegmona in the region of the thoracic soft tissues (2 streptococci). In 1 patient a chronic pleural empyema with MRSA infection was treated. Septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint with joint destruction and extensive phlegmona in the region of the cervical soft tissues (1 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Staphylococcus aureus) was treated in 2 patients. In all cases instillation of the wound was performed with Lavasept 0.2 %. Swabs of the wound were taken before starting and after ending V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy as well as before wound closure. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 48.8 +/- 18.9 years. V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy was performed for 6.5 +/- 1.7 days. Instillation time amounted to 21.7 +/- 5.7 s. The duration of action was standardised at 18 min in all cases. In 2 cases (1 MESA, 1 finegoldia) the V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy was repeated. In 10 patients a sterile wound status was achieved before secondary wound closure. All wounds underwent secondary closure without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic osteomyelitis with MRSA infections as well as chronically infected residual cavities after empyema surgery and extensive phlegmona are possible indications for V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy in order to help eradicating the infection as quickly and as completely as possible.
TI  - In vivo VL-targeted microbial superantigen induced global shifts in the B cell repertoire.
AB  - To subvert host defenses, some microbial pathogens produce proteins that interact with conserved motifs in V regions of B cell Ag receptor shared by large sets of lymphocytes, which define the properties of a superantigen. Because the clonal composition of the lymphocyte pool is a major determinant of immune responsiveness, this study was undertaken to examine the in vivo effect on the host immune system of exposure to a B cell superantigen, protein L (PpL), a product of the common commensal bacterial species, Finegoldia magna, which is one of the most common pathogenic species among Gram-positive anaerobic cocci. Libraries of Vkappa L chain transcripts were generated from the spleens of control and PpL-exposed mice, and the expressed Vkappa rearrangements were characterized by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 120,855 sequencing reads could be assigned to a germline Vkappa gene, with all 20 known Vkappa subgroups represented. In control mice, we found a recurrent and consistent hierarchy of Vkappa gene usage, as well as patterns of preferential Vkappa-Jkappa pairing. PpL exposure induced significant targeted global shifts in repertoire with reduction of Vkappa that contain the superantigen binding motif in all exposed mice. We found significant targeted reductions in the expression of clonotypes encoded by 14 specific Vkappa genes with the predicted PpL binding motif. These rigorous surveys document the capacity of a microbial protein to modulate the composition of the expressed lymphocyte repertoire, which also has broad potential implications for host-microbiome and host-pathogen relationships.
TI  - Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus): an overlooked etiology for toxic shock syndrome?
AB  - Finegoldia magna is an anaerobic Gram positive coccus, previously classified as Peptostreoptococcus magnus. It is normal flora of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract, and can be isolated from skin and the oral cavity and is often regarded as a contaminant in cultures. As the most frequently isolated anaerobic coccus, it is implicated in a range of mono- and polymicrobial infections, including skin and skin structure, bone and joint (native and prosthetic joints), infective endocarditis (native and prosthetic valves), necrotizing pneumonia, mediastinitis and meningitis. Recently, whole genome sequencing furthered the understanding of the pathogenicity of this organism by elucidating both chromosomally encoded and mobile plasmid mediated virulence factors. Although no cases of toxic shock syndrome have been attributed to F. magna, we present a case of a fatal monomicrobial F. magna bacteremia and hypothesize that superantigen activity, mediated via Protein L binding the variable domain of the kappa light chains of IgG, resulted in the syndrome observed in our patient. Additionally, we suspect the overall significance of this pathogen is underestimated and with more sensitive detection methods, this organism will be identified more frequently in clinical cultures and associated with true infection.
TI  - The B-cell superantigen Finegoldia magna protein L causes pulmonary inflammation  by a mechanism dependent on MyD88 but not B cells or immunoglobulins.
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: To determine whether Finegoldia magna protein L (PL) causes lung inflammation and, if so, whether the response is dependent on its immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding B-cell superantigenic property. MATERIAL: Pulmonary inflammatory reactions were analyzed at various time points after intratracheal administration of PL to various strains of mice. RESULTS: PL caused peribronchial and perivascular inflammation that peaked at 18-24 h. Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) began to accumulate in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of PL-challenged mice by 4 h and accounted for >90% of leukocytes by 18-24 h. Inflammation was marked by the appearance of MIP-2, KC, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in the BALF with peak levels attained 4 h after PL administration. PL-induced pulmonary inflammation was associated with increased airway hyper-reactivity following inhalation of methacholine. The inflammatory reaction was unabated in mice lacking B cells and immunoglobulins. In contrast, PL-induced inflammation was abrogated in MyD88-deficient mice. PL-induced responses required alveolar macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that PL-induced lung inflammation is dependent on an innate MyD88-dependent pathway rather than the Ig-binding properties of this microbial B cell superantigen. We propose that this pulmonary inflammatory reaction is caused by the interaction of PL with a Toll-like receptor expressed on alveolar macrophages.
TI  - Necrotising pneumonia due to Finegoldia magna.
AB  
TI  - Postoperative mediastinitis due to Finegoldia magna with negative blood cultures.
AB  - We report a case of Finegoldia magna (formerly known as Peptostreptococcus magnus) mediastinitis following coronary artery bypass in a 50-year-old patient. Even if staphylococci remain the main causative organism of postoperative mediastinitis, the responsibility of anaerobic bacteria must be considered in cases of fever and sternal drainage with negative blood cultures.
TI  - Alternate arrangement of PpL B3 domain and SpA D domain creates synergistic double-site binding to VH3 and Vkappa regions of fab.
AB  - In our previous study, a kind of novel hybrid immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding proteins (IBPs) was obtained with the characteristic structure of alternately arranged Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) protein L (P. magnus protein L, PpL) B3 domain (B3) and Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) D domain (D). In this study, two representative molecules of these novel proteins, LD3 (B3-D-B3) and LD5 (B3-D-B3-D-B3) (LD3/5), showed substantially higher affinity for IgG-F(ab')2, IgM, and IgA than 4L (B3-B3-B3-B3) or SpA, which were also demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance detection. Further, LD5 showed much stronger binding to single-chain Fv (scFv) KM38 (V(H)3-V(kappa)I) than to KM41 (V(H)1-V(kappa)III) or KM36 (V(H)3-V(kappa)III). Competitive inhibition studies showed that 4L alone or in combination with SpA (4L + SpA) was a weaker inhibitor than LD3/5 in inhibiting LD3/5's binding to IgG-F(ab')2, IgM, or IgA. The computer modeling suggested that the B3-D arrangement in LD3/5 could simultaneously bind to V(H)3 and V(kappa). Thus, our results indicated for the first time that alternate arrangement of B3 and D domains creates synergistic double-site binding to V(H)3 and V(kappa) regions of fragment of antigen binding. The different competitive inhibition pattern of binding of LD5 to scFv KM38 by 4L + SpA suggested strict use of antibody conformation for this simultaneous double-site binding. The demonstration of this novel binding property would promote to achieve the designed hybrid IBPs for useful immunological applications.
TI  - A case of necrotizing fasciitis due to Streptococcus agalactiae, Arcanobacterium  haemolyticum, and Finegoldia magna in a dog-bitten patient with diabetes.
AB  - We report a case of necrotizing fasciitis involving Streptococcus agalactiae, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, and Finegoldia magna in a 36-yr-old female diabetic patient, which started after a minor dog bite to the toe of the patient. This case suggested that a trivial infection after a minor dog bite in an immunocompromised patient such as diabetes patient could result in a significant complication such as necrotizing fasciitis. The life-threatening infection was cured by timely above-the-knee amputation, as well as penicillin G and clindamycin therapy.
TI  - [Lumbar pyomyositis caused by Finegoldia magna (Peptostreptococcus magnus) in a patient with hepatitis C virus infection].
AB  
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Finegoldia magna, an anaerobic opportunistic pathogen.
AB  - Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus), a member of the Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC), is a commensal bacterium colonizing human skin and mucous membranes. Moreover, it is also recognized as an opportunistic pathogen responsible for various infectious diseases. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of F. magna ATCC 29328. The genome consists of a 1,797,577 bp circular chromosome and an 189,163 bp plasmid (pPEP1). The metabolic maps constructed based on the genome information confirmed that most F. magna strains cannot ferment most sugars, except fructose, and have various aminopeptidase activities. Three homologs of albumin-binding protein, a known virulence factor useful for antiphagocytosis, are encoded on the chromosome, and one albumin-binding protein homolog is encoded on the plasmid. A unique feature of the genome is that F. magna encodes many sortase genes, of which substrates may be involved in bacterial pathogenesis, such as antiphagocytosis and adherence to the host cell. The plasmid pPEP1 encodes seven sortase and seven substrate genes, whereas the chromosome encodes four sortase and 19 substrate genes. These plasmid-encoded sortases may play important roles in the pathogenesis of F. magna by enriching the variety of cell wall anchored surface proteins.
TI  - European surveillance study on antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) are a heterogeneous group of microorganisms  frequently isolated from local and systemic infections. In this study, the antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical strains isolated in 10 European countries were investigated. After identification of 299 GPAC to species level, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole, vancomycin and linezolid were determined by the agar dilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The majority of isolates were identified as Finegoldia magna and Parvimonas micra (formerly Peptostreptococcus micros), isolated from skin and soft tissue infections. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem, metronidazole, vancomycin and linezolid. Twenty-one isolates (7%) were resistant to penicillin (n=13) and/or to clindamycin (n=12). Four isolates were resistant to both agents. The majority of resistant isolates were identified as F. magna and originated from blood, abscesses and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Development of 16S rRNA-based probes for the identification of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  - Fluorescent probes targeted at 16S rRNA were designed for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus stomatis (Pana134), Parvimonas micra (Pamic1435), Finegoldia magna (Fmag1250), Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (Pnasa1254), Peptoniphilus ivorii (Pnivo731), Peptoniphilus harei (Pnhar1466), Anaerococcus vaginalis (Avag1280) and Anaerococcus lactolyticus (Alac1438), based on the 16S rRNA sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. These strains were also used for validation of the probes. Application of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) could be identified with this set of probes. The 16S rRNAs of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. Most of these isolates were GPAC that were not targeted by the probes. No clinical isolates of Pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. Near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. Of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. The Fmag1250, Pamic1435, Pnhar1466, Pana134, Pnasa1254 and Pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. The Avag1280 and Alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. However, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for the majority of clinical isolates.
TI  - Crystal structure of a bacterial albumin-binding domain at 1.4 A resolution.
AB  - The albumin-binding domain, or GA module, of the peptostreptococcal albumin-binding protein expressed in pathogenic strains of Finegoldia magna is believed to be responsible for the virulence and increased growth rate of these strains. Here we present the 1.4A crystal structure of this domain, and compare it with the crystal structure of the GA-albumin complex. An analysis of protein-protein interactions in the two crystals, and the presence of multimeric GA species in solution, indicate the GA module is "sticky", and is capable of forming contacts with a range of protein surfaces. This might lead to interactions with different host proteins.
TI  - Human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. Inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. Against two azithromycin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (MIC=0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. All three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of Hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin MIC=4.0 microg/ml). Both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (Finegoldia [Peptostreptococcus] magna Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella bivia, and Prevotella melaninogenica). Moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both Prevotella species. In this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of H. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. These findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated  from diabetic foot infections.
AB  - Against 443 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from diabetic foot infections, ceftobiprole MICs (microg/ml) at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited were as follows: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 1; methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, 0.5; Anaerococcus prevotii, 0.125; Finegoldia magna, 0.5; Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, 1; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 4; Escherichia coli and Enterobacter species, 0.125; Klebsiella species, 2; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 8.
TI  - In vitro activity of oritavancin (LY333328), vancomycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against Clostridium perfringens, Propionibacterium acnes, and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Using an agar dilution method, we determined the in vitro activity of oritavancin, vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 114 unique clinical isolates of Gram-positive anaerobes. MIC(90)s (microg/mL) for oritavancin were as follows: Clostridium perfringens 1.0, Propionibacterium acnes 0.25, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius 0.25, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 0.5, Finegoldia magna 0.25, Micromonas. micros 0.25, and Anaerococcus prevotii 0.25. On a weight basis, oritavancin is slightly more active than vancomycin against the strains tested. The oritavancin MICs are comparable to those previously reported against staphylococci and enterococci. Oritavancin shows excellent potential for treatment of infections containing Gram-positive anaerobes such as these.
TI  - Anaerobic microbiology in 198 cases of pleural empyema: a Bulgarian study.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of anaerobic bacteria in 198 patients with pleural empyema and the susceptibility of isolates to eight antibacterial agents. Isolates were identified by the Crystal anaerobes identification system, API System rapid ID 32 A and/or routine methods. Susceptibility was tested by Sceptor MIC system for anaerobic bacteria and limited agar dilution method. Anaerobic bacteria were found in 74.2% of the patients and included 247 strains within 21 genera. The predominant anaerobes were Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (52 isolates), Fusobacterium (51), microaerophilic streptococci (24), Prevotella (19) and Bacteroides species (11). Common species/groups were Fusobacterium nucleatum (in 27.2% of specimens yielding anaerobes), Micromonas micros (8.2%), Finegoldia magna (7.5%), Bacteroides fragilis group (6.8%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6.1%) and F. necrophorum (5.4%). No resistance to chloramphenicol and ampicillin/sulbactam was detected. The susceptibility rates of Gram-negative anaerobic isolates to penicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and tetracycline were 63.8%, 90.2%, 87.8%, 58.6%, 98.8% and 71%, and those of Gram-positive anaerobes were 79.2%, 100%, 84.3%, 68.4%, 41.9% and 75%, respectively. The wide diversity of isolated anaerobic genera and species and the susceptibility patterns of the isolates emphasize the role of the anaerobic microbiology in cases of pleural empyema.
TI  - [Two cases of Bartholin's gland abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and  Haemophilus influenzae].
AB  - Most of Bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. However, we have encountered two very interesting cases of Bartholin's gland abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. In the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (CFDN), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered. The treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. Microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated S. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). After an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. In the second case, after an incision and drainage of Bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (AMPC), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. The treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. However, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. Microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of Haemophilus influenzae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated H. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR). After performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, CFTM-PI, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. In addition, the analysis of these two cases using PK/PD theory revealed that the time above MIC reached 100% with administration of CFTM-PI 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. There are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. In addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on PK/PD theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.
TI  - Use of bioinformatics and PCR in the search for ABC transporter homology among various bacteria.
AB  - Bioinformatics databases and search tools are utilised to produce polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for the amplification of an ABC transporter gene from the clinically important anaerobe Finegoldia magna. On sequencing, a 450 base pair amplicon showed homology with the amino acid transporter of Enterococcus faecalis. Little sequence data is available for F. magna and the newly isolated DNA could be a useful tool in the identification of this organism in clinical specimens.
TI  - Crystal structure and biological implications of a bacterial albumin binding module in complex with human serum albumin.
AB  - Many bactericide species express surface proteins that interact with human serum  albumin (HSA). Protein PAB from the anaerobic bacterium Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) represents one of these proteins. Protein PAB contains a domain of 53 amino acid residues known as the GA module. GA homologs are also found in protein G of group C and G streptococci. Here we report the crystal structure of HSA in complex with the GA module of protein PAB. The model of the complex was refined to a resolution of 2.7 A and reveals a novel binding epitope located in domain II of the albumin molecule. The GA module is composed of a left-handed three-helix bundle, and residues from the second helix and the loops surrounding it were found to be involved in HSA binding. Furthermore, the presence of HSA-bound fatty acids seems to influence HSA-GA complex formation. F. magna has a much more restricted host specificity compared with C and G streptococci, which is also reflected in the binding of different animal albumins by proteins PAB and G. The structure of the HSA-GA complex offers a molecular explanation to this unusually clear example of bacterial adaptation.
TI  - Nitroimidazole resistance genes (nimB) in anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (previously Peptostreptococcus spp.).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate metronidazole resistance and the prevalence of nitroimidazole (nim) genes in clinically isolated anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. METHODS: Metronidazole susceptibility was determined in 99 strains of anaerobic Gram-positive cocci and PCR amplification for the nim gene carried out on 61 strains (metronidazole MIC > or =0.5 mg/L). RESULTS: The nimB gene was detected in 34% (21/61) of the strains. These included two highly resistant Finegoldia magna strains (MICs >128 mg/L). The nimB gene was, however, also demonstrated in 90% (19/21) of susceptible strains. CONCLUSIONS: Although the nimB gene may be implicated in the high-level metronidazole resistance in 2 F. magna strains, the alarmingly high prevalence of the nimB gene in anaerobic Gram-positive cocci cannot be directly associated with resistance and the possibility of a silent nimB gene should be considered.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the four rRNA operons in Finegoldia magna ATCC29328.
AB  - There are four rRNA operons rrnA, rrnB, rrnC and rrnD on the genome of Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) ATCC29328, which, in contrast to those of Clostridia, are dispersed around the chromosome. Using a BAC library we determined the nucleotide sequences and structures of all four operons, including their flanking regions, and performed comparative analyses. We identified putative boxA sequences in the operons, which should be required for rRNA transcription antitermination, as well as their respective tandem promoters, AT-rich UP elements in the upstream region and Rho-independent terminators in the downstream region. The mosaic features of the operons were revealed. Multiple tRNAs were identified in the downstream region of two operons, 18 in rrnC and 11 in rrnD. They were presumed to form transcription units together with rRNAs. rrnA and rrnB had repeat units with Rho-independent terminators instead of tRNAs in the downstream region. rrnB and rrnC were the most similar in rrn upstream promoter region. Focusing on the sequence variations of rRNA genes, rrnB alone was heterogeneous. In light of previous reports, we also assessed the correlation between intercistronic rRNA sequence differences and distances between the operons, but no positive correlation was seen in this strain.
TI  - Phospholipid analogue profiles of Peptostreptococcus, Micromonas, and Finegoldia  species analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
AB  - Species of Peptostreptococcus cause a variety of infections, primarily abscesses  of soft tissues, joints, and mucous membranes. The aim of this study was to compare the phospholipid analogue profiles of Peptostreptococcus species, represented by P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. lacrimalis, and P. prevotii; Micromonas micros (P. micros) and Finegoldia magna (P. magnus). After anaerobic growth on blood-FAA, lipids extracted by chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v) were purified, then analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) in negative ion mode. The major peaks with mass to charge (m/z) 719, 721, and 749, corresponded to phosphatidylglycerol analogues, namely PG (32:1), PG (32:0), and PG (34:0), which have been found previously in Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Staphylococcus spp. Other major peaks observed, with m/z 619, 647, 665, 675, 677, 687, 691, 693, 701, 703, 707, 733, and 746 have also been reported in one or more of these three species. However, other major peaks found here in Peptostreptococcus, Micromonas, and Finegoldia have not been described elsewhere; these are 501, 514, 515, 618, 659, 673, 676, 688, 690, 692, 694, 700, 706, 715, 718, 722, and 750. We conclude that Peptostreptococcus, Micromonas, and Finegoldia isolates are chemically unique.
TI  - Bacterial artificial chromosome library of Finegoldia magna ATCC 29328 for genetic mapping and comparative genomics.
AB  - We constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of Finegoldia magna ATCC 29328 DNA to facilitate further genome analysis of F. magna. The BAC library contained 385 clones with an average insert size of 55 kb, representing a 10.1-fold genomic coverage. Repeated DNA hybridization using primer sets designed on the basis of BAC-end sequences yielded nine contigs covering 95% of the chromosome and two contigs covering 98% of the plasmid. The contigs were localized on the physical map of F. magna ATCC 29328 DNA. A total of 121 BAC-end sequences revealed 103 unique genes, which had not been previously reported for F. magna. The homolog ORF of albumin-binding protein (urPAB), one of the known virulence factors from F. magna, was sequenced and localized on the physical map. Homology analysis of 121 BAC-end sequences revealed that F. magna is most closely related to clostridia, particularly Clostridium tetani. This close relationship is consistent with the recent classification of peptostreptococci based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis.

TI  - Endocarditis caused by Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus): diagnosis depends on the blood culture system used.
AB  - We present a patient with prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus). Blood cultures in the BacT/ALERT and BACTEC 9240 system were negative. We therefore tested different blood culture systems: F. magna grew in the SEPTI-CHEK BHI-S and in the ISOLATOR, but not in the BacT/ALERT system.
TI  - Rapid identification of Gram-positive anaerobic coccal species originally classified in the genus Peptostreptococcus by multiplex PCR assays using genus- and species-specific primers.
AB  - Here, a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex PCR assay for identifying 14 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) species originally classified in the genus Peptostreptococcus (Anaerococcus hydrogenalis, Anaerococcus lactolyticus, Anaerococcus octavius, Anaerococcus prevotii, Anaerococcus tetradius, Anaerococcus vaginalis, Finegoldia magna, Micromonas micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Peptoniphilus harei, Peptoniphilus indolicus, Peptoniphilus ivorii and Peptoniphilus lacrimalis) is reported. Fourteen type strains representing 14 GPAC species were first identified to the genus level by multiplex PCR (multiplex PCR-G). Since three of these genera (Finegoldia, Micromonas and Peptostreptococcus) contain only a single species, F. magna, M. micros and P. anaerobius, respectively, these organisms were identified to the species level directly by using the multiplex PCR-G. Then six species of the genus Anaerococcus (A. hydrogenalis, A. lactolyticus, A. octavius, A. prevotii, A. vaginalis and A. tetradius) were further identified to the species level using multiplex PCR assays (multiplex PCR-Ia and multiplex PCR-Ib). Similarly, five species of the genus Peptoniphilus (Pn. asaccharolyticus, Pn. harei, Pn. indolicus, Pn. ivorii and Pn. lacrimalis) were identified to the species level using multiplex PCR-IIa and multiplex PCR-IIb. The established two-step multiplex PCR identification scheme was applied to the identification of 190 clinical isolates of GPAC species that had been identified previously to the species level by 16S rRNA sequencing and phenotypic tests. The identification obtained from multiplex PCR assays showed 100 % agreement with 16S rDNA sequencing identification, but only 65 % (123/190) agreement with the identification obtained by phenotypic tests. The multiplex PCR scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of GPAC species. It will permit a more accurate assessment of the role of various GPAC species in infection and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of L-cladinose and a C(11)-C(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. We evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. METHODS: In the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against 180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), Finegoldia magna (n = 20), Bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and Prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin A, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. In the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by B. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). RESULTS: In the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of S. agalactiae, E. faecalis, N. gonorrhoeae, P. anaerobius, F. magna, B. fragilis and P. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. Telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. In the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.
TI  - Physical and genetic map of the Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) ATCC 29328 genome.
AB  - A physical and genetic map of Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) ATCC 29328 chromosome was constructed. The order of rare cleavage restriction fragments was determined by double digestion with the restriction enzymes I-CeuI, SgrAI, ApaI and PmeI, cross-hybridization and ApaI-linking clones. The size of the circular chromosome of F. magna was estimated to be 1.9 Mb. This strain also had a 200-kb megaplasmid. The chromosome contained four rrn operons, and the orientation of two rrn operons was opposite to the others. Fragment analysis of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337(T) chromosome suggested that its size was much smaller than that of F. magna ATCC 29328.
