TI  == [bacterial infection as a cause of infertility in humans].
AB  == microorganisms which are present in the human urogenital tract may be involved in the development of inflammatory changes negatively affecting the genitals in both men and women. pathological conditions due to inflammatory alterations may result in complete loss of fertility. infections of the urogenital tract are responsible for 15% of all cases of infertility in couples. negative impact on the human reproduction is mainly caused by direct damage to the genital tract mucosa by metabolic products of microorganisms or by induction of pro-inflammatory responses of the body. another mechanism is indirect impact of microorganisms on  the genital function. moreover, the effect of bacteria on spermatogenesis and semen quality is important in men. infections mainly caused by chlamydia trachomatis or neisseria gonorrhoeae represent the greatest risk in terms of permanent consequences for human reproduction. as for other sexually transmitted  disorders, such as infections caused by gardnerella vaginalis, urogenital mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas, the link between infection and infertility has been intensively researched.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis inhibits superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-induced  interleukin-8 from human vaginal epithelial cells through tetramic acids.
AB  == the vaginal mucosa can be colonized by many bacteria including commensal organisms and potential pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus. some strains of s. aureus produce the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, which can penetrate the vaginal epithelium to cause toxic shock syndrome. we have observed  that a female was mono-colonized with enterococcus faecalis vaginally as tested in aerobic culture, even upon repeated culture for six months, suggesting this organism was negatively influencing colonization by other bacteria. in recent studies, we demonstrated an "outside-in" mechanism of cytokine signaling and consequent inflammation that facilitates the ability of potential pathogens to initiate infection from mucosal surfaces. thus, we hypothesized that this strain  of e. faecalis may make anti-inflammatory factors which block disease progression of more pathogenic organisms. e. faecalis mn1 inhibited interleukin-8 production  from human vaginal epithelial cells in response to the vaginal pathogens candida  albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. we further demonstrated that this organism secretes two tetramic acid compounds which appear responsible for inhibition of interleukin-8  production, as well as inhibition of t cell proliferation due to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. microbicides that include anti-inflammatory molecules, such as  these tetramic acid compounds naturally produced by e. faecalis mn1, may be useful in prevention of diseases that develop from vaginal infections.
