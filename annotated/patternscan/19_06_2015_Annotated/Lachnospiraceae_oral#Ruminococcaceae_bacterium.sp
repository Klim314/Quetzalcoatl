TI  == effect of oral administration of metronidazole or prednisolone on fecal microbiota in dogs.
AB  == gastrointestinal microbiota have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various gastrointestinal disorders in dogs, including acute diarrhea and chronic enteropathy. metronidazole and prednisolone are commonly prescribed for the treatment of these diseases; however, their effects on gastrointestinal microbiota have not been investigated. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of these drugs on the gastrointestinal microbiota of dogs. metronidazole was administered twice daily at 12.5 mg/kg to a group of five healthy dogs, and prednisolone at 1.0 mg/kg daily to a second group of five healthy dogs for 14 days. fecal samples were collected before and after administration (day 0 and 14), and 14 and 28 days after cessation (day 28 and 42). dna was extracted, and the bacterial diversity and composition of each sample were determined based on 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequences using next-generation sequencing (illumina miseq). in the group administered metronidazole, bacterial diversity indices significantly decreased at day 14, and recovered after the cessation. principal coordinates analysis and hierarchical dendrogram construction based on unweighted and weighted unifrac distance matrices revealed that bacterial composition was also significantly altered by metronidazole at day 14 compared with the other time points. the proportions of bacteroidaceae, clostridiaceae, fusobacteriaceae, lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, turicibacteraceae, and veillonellaceae decreased, while bifidobacteriaceae, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcaceae, and streptococcaceae increased at day 14 and returned to their initial proportions by day 42. conversely, no effect of prednisolone was observed on either the bacterial diversity or composition. reducing pathogenic bacteria such as fusobacteria and increasing beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium through the administration of metronidazole may be beneficial for promoting gastrointestinal health; however, further investigations into the effects on diseased dogs are needed.

TI  == metabolomics analysis identifies intestinal microbiota-derived biomarkers of colonization resistance in clindamycin-treated mice.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota protect the host against enteric pathogens  through a defense mechanism termed colonization resistance. antibiotics excreted  into the intestinal tract may disrupt colonization resistance and alter normal metabolic functions of the microbiota. we used a mouse model to test the hypothesis that alterations in levels of bacterial metabolites in fecal specimens could provide useful biomarkers indicating disrupted or intact colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment. methods: to assess in vivo colonization resistance, mice were challenged with oral vancomycin-resistant enterococcus or clostridium difficile spores at varying time points after treatment with the lincosamide antibiotic clindamycin. for concurrent groups of antibiotic-treated mice, stool samples were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess changes in the microbiota and using non-targeted metabolic profiling. to assess whether the findings were applicable to another antibiotic class that suppresses intestinal anaerobes, similar experiments were conducted with piperacillin/tazobactam. results: colonization resistance began to recover within 5 days and was intact by 12 days after clindamycin treatment, coinciding with the recovery bacteria from the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, both part of the phylum firmicutes. clindamycin treatment caused marked changes in metabolites present in fecal specimens. of 484 compounds analyzed, 146 (30%) exhibited a significant increase or decrease in concentration during clindamycin  treatment followed by recovery to baseline that coincided with restoration of in  vivo colonization resistance. identified as potential biomarkers of colonization  resistance, these compounds included intermediates in carbohydrate or protein metabolism that increased (pentitols, gamma-glutamyl amino acids and inositol metabolites) or decreased (pentoses, dipeptides) with clindamycin treatment. piperacillin/tazobactam treatment caused similar alterations in the intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolites. conclusions: recovery of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment coincided with restoration of several fecal bacterial metabolites. these metabolites could provide useful biomarkers indicating intact or disrupted colonization resistance during and after antibiotic treatment.
