TI  == antibiotic-resistant heterotrophic plate count bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria in aquifers of the mooi river, north west province, south africa.
AB  == groundwater in the mooi river catchment is prone to mining, agricultural, municipal and septic tank pollution. in this study physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were determined using appropriate methods. bacterial isolates were identified by 16s rrna sequencing (heterotrophic plate count (hpc)  bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria (arb)) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (escherichia coli). antibiotic resistance tests were also performed. physico-chemical parameters were generally within target water quality ranges for drinking water. hpc bacteria ranged between 10(5) and 10(7) colony-forming units  (cfu)/ml. e. coli were enumerated from trimpark, school and cemetery. the blaauwbank borehole was negative for faecal streptococci. pseudomonas spp. were most abundant in the bulk water. opportunistic pathogens isolated included pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, alcaligenes, flavobacterium, bacillus cereus and mycobacterium spp. varying patterns of antibiotic resistance  were observed. most hpc bacterial isolates were resistant to cephalothin and/or amoxicillin and a few were resistant to erythromycin and streptomycin. pseudomonas spp. was also the most abundant arb. other arbs included alcaligenes  faecalis, ochrobactrum sp. and achromobacter sp. arbs were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and/or amoxicillin compared to hpcs.  the presence of e. coli and arb in these groundwater sources indicates potential  human health risks. these risks should be further investigated and quantified, and groundwater should be treated before use.

TI  == native soil bacteria isolates in mexico exhibit a promising antagonistic effect against fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici.
AB  == sinaloa state accounts for 23% of mexico's tomato production. one constraint on this important crop is the fusarium crown and root rot, caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, which has been reported to reduce crop yield by up to 50%. in this study, we set out to identify bacterial populations which could be used to control this disease through natural antagonism. five tomato rhizospheric soil samples were collected, dried for 1-week, and homogenized. sub-samples were used to prepare an aqueous solution used to isolate microorganisms in pure cultures. organisms were purified and grown separately, and used to generate a collection of 705 bacterial isolates. thirty-four percent  from this bank (254 strains) was screened against forl, finding 27 bacteria displaying in vitro forl growth inhibition levels from 5% to 60%. these isolates  belonged to the genus bacillus and their 16sr dna sequences showed that they are  closely related to seven species and they were putatively designated as: b. subtilis, b. cereus, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. licheniformis, b. thuringiensis, b. megaterium, and b. pumilus. one isolate belonged to the genus acinetobacter. two  b. subtilis isolates (144 and 151) and one b. cereus isolate (171) showed the best antagonistic potential against fcrrt when evaluated on seedlings. plate and  activity assays indicate that these isolates include a diverse repertoire of functional antagonistic traits that might explain their ability to control fcrrt. moreover, bacteria showed partial hemolytic activity, and future research will be directed at ensuring that their application will be not harmful for humans and effective against forl in greenhouse or field conditions.

TI  == potential application of the nisin z preparation of lactococcus lactis w8 in preservation of milk.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == intergeneric coaggregation of non-flocculating acinetobacter spp. isolates with other sludge-constituting bacteria.
AB  == the ability of non-flocculating acinetobacter spp. isolates (a. johnsonii s35 and a. junii s33) to coaggregate with other sludge-constituting bacteria obtained from a sewage sludge sample was assessed by a spectrophotometric assay. a. johnsonii s35 showed significant coaggregation (aggregation index (ai)=70 to 99%) with 7 strains, bacillus cereus, blastomonas natatoria, mycobacterium sp., thermomonas brevis, and enterobacteriaceae family, identified by sequencing of 16s rrna genes. a. junii s33 coaggregated with 4 strains, which were also coaggregating partners of a. johnsonii s35, as indicated by ai values of 59-93%.  the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon (math) assay showed that both a. johnsonii  s35 and a. junii s33 possess a hydrophobic character as indicated by their relative cell surface hydrophobicity (rcsh), 88 and 61%, respectively. a good correlation was observed between the degree of coaggregation of the acinetobacter spp. isolates and the rcsh of their partner strains. the cells of an a. johnsonii s35 spontaneous mutant and a. johnsonii iam1517, which had a hydrophilic cell surface, did not coaggregate with the other examined isolates. these results demonstrated that hydrophobic interaction plays an important role in the intergeneric coaggregation of acinetobacter spp. isolates with other sludge-constituting bacteria.

TI  == characterization of contamination in and toxicities of a shipyard area in hong kong.
AB  == this is the first integrated study on the contaminant characterization and toxicities of a shipyard area. this site in hong kong contained 3.6-33.4 mg kg(-1) dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and 5-79 g kg(-1) oil and grease. other pollutants exceeding the dutch intervention values were total polyaromatic hydrocarbons, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and metals cu, pb and zn. these pollutants persisted partially owing to the poor fertility with <125 mg n kg(-1)  and <530 mg p kg(-1) typical of coastal soil. sediments collected within 100 m also showed contamination exceeding the china and hong kong intervention levels.  the shipyard soil killed two bacteria pseudomonas stutzeri and acinetobacter sp.  isolated from a clean coastal soil, inhibited germination of three exogenous plants triticum aestivum, brassica chinense and lolium perenne, and inhibited proliferation of three indigenous bacteria: methylobacterium sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus. thus, ex situ remediation was needed.

TI  == characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.

TI  == diversity of biosurfactant producing microorganisms isolated from soils contaminated with diesel oil.
AB  == biosurfactant production is a desirable property of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (hdm). we characterized biosurfactant producing microbial populations from a long beach soil, california (usa) and a hong kong soil (china), contaminated with diesel oil. a total of 33 hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms were isolated from the soils. twelve isolates and three defined consortia were tested for biosurfactant production and emulsification activity. the highest reduction of surface tension was achieved with a consortium of l1, l2 and l3 isolates from a long beach soil (41.4mn m(-1)). isolate l1 (acinetobacter  junii) displayed the highest reduction of surface tension (46.5 mn m(-1)). the emulsifying capacity evaluated by the e24 emulsification index was highest in the culture of isolate l5 (74%). no substantial emulsification was achieved with the  cell-free extracts, indicating that the emulsifying activity was not extracellular. based on surface tension and the e24 index results, isolates f1, f2, f3, f4, l1, l2, l3 and l4 were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing as bacillus cereus, bacillus sphaericus, b. fusiformis, acinetobacter junii, a non-cultured bacterium, pseudomonas sp. and b. pumilus, respectively. cluster analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences of the bacterial isolates revealed 70% similarity amongst hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community present in both soils. five isolates (isolates f1, f2, f3, f4 and l4) belong to the firmicutes order, two isolates (l1 and l3) belong to the proteobacteria order and one isolate (l2) is an actinomyces sp. simpson's index (1 - d) and the shannon-weaver index (h) revealed more diversity of hdm in the hong kong soil, while evenness (e) and the equitability (j) data indicated that there was not a dominant population. bacterial isolates displaying substantial potential for production of biosurfactants can be applied in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons.

TI  == dust-borne bacteria in animal sheds, schools and children's day care centres.
AB  == a total of 316 bacterial strains, including psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles, were isolated and identified from indoor dusts in schools, children's day care centres and animal sheds. several species which had not previously been reported from indoor environments were found: sphingomonas, brevibacterium, nocardiopsis, deinococcus and rhodococcus/gordona. a new psychrophilic actinomycete genus was also found in animal sheds, representing a new undescribed peptidoglycan type and an unusual whole-cell fatty acid composition. the indoor dusts of animal sheds contained mainly the gram-negative  genera pseudomonas, pantoea, flavobacterium and xanthomonas early in the indoor feeding season, but changed to a composition dominated by bacillus, micrococcus and mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes towards the end of the season. the  dust contained, and air-borne bacterial flora in schools and day care centres were dominated by, gram-positive bacilli and actinomycetes, notably bacillus cereus, brevibacillus brevis, b. licheniformis, b. subtilis and species of arthrobacter, corynebacterium, rhodococcus/gordona, nocardiopsis sp., deinococcus, staphylococcus and micrococcus. indoor air and dust contained klebsiella oxytoca, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, ac. lwoffi, bacillus cereus and  nocardiopsis dassonvillei with the status of hazard group ii. indoor dusts of animal sheds contained eight different 3-hydroxy fatty acids, the 2-hydroxy fatty acid 14:0 and two 10-methyl fatty acids, whereas in dusts from schools and day care centres, these were below the detection level (< 3.5 ng mg-1). the 3-and 2-hydroxy fatty acids could be assigned to one or more of the dust-contained cultivable strains, but 10-methyl c16:0 was not present in any of the strains isolated. the dusts from schools and children's day care centres contained 0.2-0.3 ng of endotoxin mg-1 and 0.5-1.4 ng of beta-d-glucan mg-1, whereas the dusts from animal sheds contained more 0.3-41 ng mg-1 and 8-35 ng mg-1, respectively.
