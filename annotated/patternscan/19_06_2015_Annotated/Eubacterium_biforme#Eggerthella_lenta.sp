TI  == rapid detection of human fecal eubacterium species and related genera by nested pcr method.
AB  == pcr procedures based on 16s rdna gene sequence specific for seven eubacterium spp. and eggerthella lenta that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed, and used for direct detection of these species in seven human feces samples. three species of eggerthella lenta, eubacterium rectale, and eubacterium eligens were detected from seven fecal samples. eubacterium biforme was detected  from six samples. it was reported that e. rectale, e. eligens, and e. biforme were difficult to detect by traditional culture method, but the nested pcr method is available for the detection of these species. this result shows that the nested pcr method utilizing a universal primer pair, followed by amplification with species-specific primers, would allow rapid detection of eubacterium species in human feces.
