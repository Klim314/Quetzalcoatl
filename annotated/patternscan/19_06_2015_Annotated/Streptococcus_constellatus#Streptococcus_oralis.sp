TI  == development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == background: dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. the principal method of prevention  is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. in-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. the aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the calgary biofilm device (cbd) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. the specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. results: pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. a mean of 320 and 250 otus were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm  samples, respectively. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. in addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (amova). there were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (amova, p < 0.002). pcoa revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (amova, p < 0.001). veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant otus detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst prevotella oralis, v. parvula and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. conclusions: diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the cbd. biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. this model could be used to screen  both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == erythromycin and penicillin resistance mechanisms among viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and erythromycin-penicillin resistance mechanisms of viridans streptococci (vgs) isolates from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases. fifty vgs blood culture isolates were screened for their antibiotic susceptibilities against penicillin g, erythromycin and tetracycline by e-test. clindamycin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin  susceptibility were performed by broth microdilution method. erythromycin and penicillin resistance genotypes, ermb and mefa/e, pbp1a, pbp2b and pbp2x are amplified using pcr method. the clinical isolates included streptococcus mitis (n. 19), s.oralis (n. 13), s.sanguinis, s.parasanguinis (n. 6, each), s.salivarius, s.vestibularis (n. 2, each), s.constellatus, s.sobrinus (n. 1, each). the percentage resistance against erythromycin and penicillin was 36% and  30%, respectively. the genotypic carriage rate of erythromycin resistance genes were: 56% ermb, 28% mefe, 8% ermb+mefe. penicillin-resistant isolates carried pbp2b (33.3%) and pbp2x (20%) genes. twenty-four vgs isolates were recovered from patients with cancer. s.mitis and s.oralis predominated among patients with cancer who had erythromycin and penicillin resistance isolates. the importance of classical antimicrobial agents like penicillin and erythromycin warrants the continuous surveillance of invasive vgs isolates and can guide better treatment options especially in patients with underlying diseases.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == oral streptococcal strains isolated from odontogenic infections and their susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify at species level and to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of oral streptococcal strains isolated from 100 pus samples collected from romanian patients with different odontogenic infections. the isolates were identified at species level using the rapid id 32 strep system  and their susceptibility was testing by the etest, against: penicillin g, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. for the investigation of  erythromycin resistance phenotype the disk diffusion test was used. the isolates  belonged to several species, with streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis predominating. reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was found only among the isolates belonging to s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups. resistance to erythromycin was detected among all species, except for: s. constellatus, s. intermedius and s. gordonii, and the m phenotype was established, while resistance to tetracycline was detected within all species but s. gordonii. in contrast, clindamycin was fully active. as most odontogenic infections are mixed  infections, often involving strictly anaerobic bacteria, which are frequently beta-lactamase producers, the association of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, like amoxiclav, is recommended when the antimicrobial treatment is necessary.

TI  == tigecycline (gar-936) activity against streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci by sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna spacer region.
AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == groesl sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the full-length sequences of the groesl genes (also known as cpn10/60) of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordonii, and  streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groesl genes of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius were determined. the lengths of the groes genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groel determined for  4 species (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. the intergenic region (spacer) between the groes and groel genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. the variation of the groes sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groel sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). phylogenetic analysis of the groes and groel genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of  the 16s rrna gene. the intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. the groesl sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.

TI  == identification of viridans streptococcal species causing bacterial meningitis in  adults in taiwan.
AB  == in order to determine the species responsible for viridans-group streptococcal meningitis in adults in taiwan, seven cases of culture-proven meningitis due to these organisms were studied. the cases were all identified at the chang gung memorial hospital-kaohsiung over a period of 3 years, and they accounted for 9% (7/78) of all cases of culture-proven bacterial meningitis occurring in adults during this period. of the seven viridans streptococci isolates recovered, streptococcus constellatus accounted for four, streptococcus anginosus for two, and streptococcus oralis for one. thus, it appears that streptococci of the milleri group are the most common species causing bacterial meningitis in adults  in taiwan. the tendency for these organisms to cause invasive central nervous system infections in adults should not be overlooked when these species are recovered from cerebrospinal fluid specimens.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

AB  == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric  species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (ii). effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

TI  == in vitro exchange of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci and genomic organization of the pare-parc region in s. mitis.
AB  == transfer of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci was explored by transformation in vitro. one-step fq-resistant parc mutants were selected, and resistance could be transferred from dna from s. oralis, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. constellatus to s. pneumoniae, with frequencies of 10(-3) to <10(-7) in correlation with the homologies of their quinolone resistance determining region sequences (95%, 91%,  85%, and 81%, respectively). reciprocal transfers of mutated parc from dna from s. pneumoniae to s. mitis and s. oralis were also observed. simultaneous transfer of mutated parc and gyra genes from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae yielded high-level-resistant pneumococcal transformants in one step at low frequencies. the pare-parc region of the type strain s. mitis 103335t had >90% homology with that of s. pneumoniae. the efficient interspecific transfer of quinolone resistance determinants in vitro leads us to anticipate their dissemination in the clinical setting.

TI  == effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

TI  == speciation of presumptive viridans streptococci from early onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == twenty isolates resembling viridans streptococci, 16 from blood and four from gastric aspirates, from 17 cases of early onset neonatal sepsis were identified by the api20 strep, rapid id 32 strep and conventional tests plus hydrolysis of methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates. nineteen of the isolates were identified as species of viridans streptococci and one as a leuconostoc sp. ten of the isolates were streptococcus oralis, three s. mitis biotype 1, two s. mitis biotype 2 and one each of s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius and s. intermedius. the rapid id 32 strep and conventional plus methylumbelliferyl tests gave the same species identity for 17 of the isolates. s. intermedius was identified by the rapid id 32 strep as s. constellatus and s. salivarius as s. equinus, with s. salivarius at lower probability. the api20 strep failed to identify s. vestibularis and identified s. salivarius as s. defectivus. the absence of certain critical tests, including urea hydrolysis, does not allow the  api20 strep to identify all the currently recognised species of viridans steptococci. the species distribution was unexpected and the incidence of s. oralis and other viridans streptococci in vaginal swabs from prenatal patients is being investigated further.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == utilization of sialic acid by viridans streptococci.
AB  == the importance of viridans streptococci as agents of serious extra-oral diseases, including endocarditis, is now recognized. we have tested the hypothesis that the ability to utilize sialic acid as a nutrient source may play a role in the proliferation of these organisms. the type strains of the 15 presently recognized species of viridans streptococci and two clinical isolates-s. oralis (ar3), isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis, and s. intermedius (uns35),  a brain abscess isolate-were studied for their ability to utilize sialic acid. only s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. mitis ("oralis group") s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus ("milleri group"), and s. defectivus ("nutritionally variant group") were able to use sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic  acid) efficiently as a sole carbon source. formate, acetate, and ethanol were produced as the major metabolic end-products of sialic acid metabolism, while corresponding glucose-grown cultures produced lactate as the major metabolic end-product. utilization of sialic acid was independent of the production of sialidase. cell-free extracts of sialic acid-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of n-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (npl; the first enzyme in the intracellular catabolism of sialic acid) and n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (glcnac-6-p) deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate (glcn-6-p) deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of n-acetylglucosamine). these  activities were repressed by growth in the presence of glucose. the intracellular fate of sialic acid, after cleavage by npl into n-acetylmannosamine (mannac) and  pyruvate, is uncertain, but the elevated levels of glcnac-6-p deacetylase and glcn-6-p deaminase in sialic acid-grown cells suggest that phosphorylation and isomerization are possible steps in the metabolism of mannac to generate an intermediate common to the pathway of n-acetylglucosamine metabolism. the species of viridans streptococci that have the ability to utilize sialic acid are those most commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, and this ability is likely to  play a role in the persistence and survival of these infecting organisms in vivo.

AB  == over a 4-year-period, 104 isolates belonging to the viridans streptococci were recovered from the blood and identified to the species according to beighton and  co-workers. streptococcus oralis was the species most frequently recovered from patients in the hematology unit [29 of 39 (74%)]. streptococcus mitis ranked second [seven of 39 (18%)]. both species were associated with oromucositis. isolates presently identified as s. oralis are mainly those previously identified as s. mitis or streptococcus sanguis ii. streptococcus milleri was most frequently isolated in the patients from the general hospital population [28 of 65 (43%) isolates]: streptococcus anginosus (n = 20), streptococcus constellatus  (n = 4), and streptococcus intermedius (n = 4). in 14 episodes from the general hospital population, clinical significance was judged questionable. from this part of the laboratory, clinical significance could not be predicted from the number of blood cultures grown, nor from the delay of growth detection. the rapid id 32 strep system agreed well with the identifications according to the scheme of beighton et al., whereas the api 20 strep system did not.

TI  == degradative enzymes of oral streptococci.
AB  == members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg) and streptococcus milleri group  (smg) were screened for their ability to produce glycosidase, arylamidase (peptidase), protease, dextranase and glycosyltransferase activities. species within each group produced unique patterns of activity. the most commonly produced glycosidases were beta-d-glucosidase, beta-d-galactosidase, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase and the least commonly produced glycosidase activity was beta-fucosidase with streptococcus intermedius (smg) being the only species capable of producing the activity. for arylamidase activity, the most commonly produced type was lysine-arylamidase. glycosidase and arylamidase activities were localized to particular sub-cellular fractions. alpha-galactosidase was found only in culture  supernatant fluids whereas n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase was found in all fractions; the culture supernatant, cell wall, cell membrane and cytoplasm. no arylamidase activity was seen in culture supernatants. phe-arg-arylamidase was found only in cytoplasmic fractions whereas val-pro-argarylamidase was found in cell walls, cell membranes and cytoplasmic fraction. protease activity was measured as the degradation of bovine serum albumin (bsa) and casein. casein was  degraded by a number of strains whereas no species/strains were able to degrade bsa. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus (smg), streptococcus mitior and streptococcus defectivus (ssg) were the only species that produced hyaluronidase and no species produced chondroitin sulphatase. the groups were also examined for their abilities to produce glycosyltransferase and dextranase.  strep. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis produced glucosyltransferase and, with the exception of the latter species, fructosyltransferase. no species within the smg was capable of producing either glycosyltransferase.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.

TI  == a scheme for the identification of viridans streptococci.
AB  == a collection of strains representing all the currently recognised species of oral or viridans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, s. parasanguis, s. gordonii, s.  oralis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. vestibularis, s. anginosus, s. constellatus,  s. intermedius, s. mutans and s. sobrinus) were tested for the production of a range of glycosidase activities with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates, and for reactions in a range of conventional fermentation and hydrolytic tests. the resulting biochemical scheme, consisting of 14 tests, enabled the differentiation of all these species and distinguished three biotypes within s. sanguis. the scheme reported here represents an improvement over currently available schemes for the identification of viridans streptococci.

TI  == sialidase activity of the "streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s.  gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.
