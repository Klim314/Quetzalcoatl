TI  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are part of a large family of pore-forming proteins that include the human proteins perforin and the complement membrane attack complex. the activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. an overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of cdcs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. the way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (macpf) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. in this chapter i aim to provide an overview  of our understanding of the interaction between cdcs and other members of what is now called the macpf/cdc superfamily, with their target membranes. cdcs (also in  the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four gram-positive bacterial genera (clostridium, listeria, bacillus and streptococcus). well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. listeriolysin from l. monocytogenes  is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. perfringolysin from c. perfringens (fig. 1a) has become perhaps the most studied cdc4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). streptolysin from s. pyogenes is another intensely studied cdc and has been applied widely in  experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for s. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. however, cdcs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria arcanobacterium pyogenes and gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. the homology with the macpf family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic macpf/cdc fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (fig. 1a and d). without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. the glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that cdcs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. while not all macpf domains are involved in pore formation-for example, c6 and c8beta--they are all apparently involved in action  on membranes. the dramatic refolding undergone by cdcs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the macpf/cdc domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (fig. 1a-c). it is obviously the basic assumption that  where noncdc members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 even where a member of the macpf/cdc superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. however, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another macpf/cdc family member or members from the same specific system. complement acts by a combination of the c5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting c9 to form a lesion, which may be a  complete ring of c9 associated with the c5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.

TI  == ionic factors regulating the interaction of gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin with  red blood cells.
AB  == we have studied the hemolytic properties of an exotoxin released by gardnerella vaginalis (gvh). we found that hemolysis induced by gvh is modulated by the composition of the isotonic buffer in which the red cells are suspended. in particular, low ph enhances its lytic activity, whereas low ionic strength and divalent cations diminish it. the inhibitory effects of reduced salt concentration and divalent cations occur despite normal binding of the toxin to the cells. this suggests that some post-binding step is impaired. the toxin is also able to damage cholesterol-containing lipid vesicles, and even on these model membranes it is more active at low ph. from this point of view, gvh has some similarity to clostridium perfringens theta-toxin, a membrane-damaging toxin belonging to the family of 'thiol-activated' cytolysins produced by gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == pore-forming and haemolytic properties of the gardnerella vaginalis cytolysin.
AB  == the pleomorphic bacterium gardnerella vaginalis releases in the culture broth a haemolytic exotoxin (gvh) which is probably a virulence determinant of this unique bacterium, implicated in gynaecological and urological disorders. this 59  kda cytolysin was purified to homogeneity in just one chromatographic step directly from the culture supernatant, a final specific activity up to 1.9 x 10(6) hu mg-1 being obtained. the toxin-induced lesion on human erythrocytes results from the formation of a pore whose radius is approximately 2.4 nm. the damage is inhibited by osmotic protectants and shows a sigmoidal dose-response profile suggesting an aggregation process of haemolysin molecules on the target membrane to create the functional lesion. the extent and the kinetics of haemolysis are strongly dependent on temperature and an activation energy of 64.0 kj mol-1 has been derived. lipid membranes can be very efficient inhibitors of gvh-haemolysis, being able to bind the toxin quite avidly. the inhibitory effect  requires the presence of cholesterol and it is stronger when cholesterol is mixed with negatively charged phospholipids rather than with zwitterionic phospholipids, suggesting that a negative surface potential increases the affinity of the toxin for the lipid bilayer. the functional properties of gvh have been compared with those of clostridium perfringens thetatoxin (pfo) and escherichia coli haemolysin (hlya), which are representative of widespread haemolysins produced by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. the toxin shares several features with the family of the so-called 'sulphydryl-activated' cytolysins produced by gram-positive bacteria, although gvh does not truly belong to this family, being deactivated by beta-mercaptoethanol and being antigenically distinct from them. we report here for the first time the detection in the vaginal fluid of infected women of a specific iga response against the toxin.

TI  == in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria as cause of infections in female genital organs.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria constitute a substantial component of the normal vaginal flora and of the outer cervical canal. consequently, one would expect infections emanating from the vaginal flora to be caused to a substantial degree by anaerobic bacteria. the anaerobes may contribute in colpitis, but their role is difficult to prove in this situation, since sampling only yields normal flora components. one clue that anaerobes may contribute to colpitis is the circumstance that the flora under those conditions differ from the normal situations. another is the circumstance that metronidazole, which only inhibits anaerobes, does reduce symptoms e.g. of colpitis in the presence of the microaerophilic gardnerella vaginalis, which is resistant to metronidazole (but sensitive to the metabolite hydroxymetronidazole). in the us, pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is to a substantial degree apparently caused by anaerobic bacteria. our experience in scandinavia indicates that anaerobes are of neglible importance in this condition, since we rarely isolate anaerobes in spite of adequate sampling, transport and processing of specimens. we mostly find anaerobes in post-operative pid when the vaginal wall has been passed, or as a complication of pregnancy (puerperal fever, early rupture of membranes, abortion), and in connection with intrauterine devices. the role of anaerobes in bartholinitis is established. pid may be associated with appendicitis or colonic diverticulosis. anaerobes are regularly isolated from abscesses developing in the pelvic organs.  this also applies to tuboovarial and vulvovaginal abscesses. the most important anaerobic bacteria in infections of the female genital organs are bacteroides fragilis and other species of the fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus and related  species, other bacteroides, peptococci and peptostreptococci. clostridium perfringens rarely cause infections of female genital organs, although such conditions have a dramatic course.
