TI  - Energies of activation and uncoupled growth in Streptococcus faecalis and Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Growing cultures of Streptococcus faecalis at temperatures above 30 C have activation energies for both rates of growth and glycolysis of 10.3 kcal mole(-1), and a constant growth yield; when growth takes place below this temperature, the growth yield decreases and the activation energy for growth increases to 21.1 kcal mole(-1), but the activation energy for glycolysis is unchanged. The adenosine triphosphate pool in the organisms behaves differently above and below 30 C, suggesting that the energetic coupling between anabolism and catabolism is less effective below 30 C. Washed suspensions of S. faecalis have repressed glycolytic activity and an activation energy for glycolysis of 15.6 kcal mole(-1) over the whole temperature range studied. Growing cultures of Zymomonas mobilis below 33 C have a constant growth yield of 8.3 g (dry weight) of organisms per mole of glucose degraded, and activation energies for both glycolysis and growth of 11.1 kcal mole(-1); above this temperature, the growth yield falls, the activation energy for growth changes to -6.9 kcal mole(-1), but the activation energy for glycolysis is unchanged, so that the coupling between anabolism and catabolism is less effective above 33 C. The findings support the view that energy turnover in these bacteria is not well regulated.
