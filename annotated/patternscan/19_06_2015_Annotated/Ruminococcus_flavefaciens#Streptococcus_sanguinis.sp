TI  == heterologous expression of an endoglucanase gene (enda) from the ruminal anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 in streptococcus bovis and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the heterologous expression of a cloned endoglucanase gene (enda) from the ruminal bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 was demonstrated in the streptococcus species s. bovis jb1 and s. sanguis dl1. the enda gene was introduced into s. bovis and s. sanguis using the escherichia coli/streptococcus  shuttle vector pva838. expression of the gene was detected by clearing zones around the recombinant colonies on agar plates containing carboxymethylcellulose  stained with congo red. s. bovis jb1 containing the enda gene was capable of utilizing cellotetraose at a faster rate than the parent strain. this is the first demonstration that streptococcus species can express a gene from a ruminococcus flavefaciens strain.
