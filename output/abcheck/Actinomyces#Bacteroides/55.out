in vitro antianaerobic activity of dx-619, a new des-fluoro(6) quinolone.
the in vitro activity of dx-619, a new des-f(6) quinolone, against anaerobic bacteria was evaluated.
dx-619 showed potent activity against bacteroides, prevotella, fusobacterium, micromonas, actinomyces, and clostridium spp., with mic(50)s/mic(90)s of </=0.03 to 0.25/</=0.03 to 1 microg/ml, respectively.
dx-619 was also active against imipenem-resistant bacteroides spp., with mic(50)s/mic(90)s of 0.25/1 microg/ml, respectively.
