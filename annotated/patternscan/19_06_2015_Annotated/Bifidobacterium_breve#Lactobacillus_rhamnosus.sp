TI  == pyrosequencing analysis reveals changes in intestinal microbiota of healthy adults who received a daily dose of immunomodulatory probiotic strains.
AB  == the colon microbiota plays a crucial role in human gastrointestinal health. current attempts to manipulate the colon microbiota composition are aimed at finding remedies for various diseases. we have recently described the immunomodulatory effects of three probiotic strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-4036, lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4034, and bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035). the goal of the present study was to analyze the compositions of the fecal microbiota of healthy adults who received one of these strains using high-throughput 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing. bacteroides was the most abundant genus in the groups that received l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036 or l. paracasei cncm i-4034. the shannon indices were significantly increased in these  two groups. our results also revealed a significant increase in the lactobacillus genus after the intervention with l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036. the initially different colon microbiota became homogeneous in the subjects who received l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036. while some orders that were initially present disappeared  after the administration of l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036, other orders, such as sphingobacteriales, nitrospirales, desulfobacterales, thiotrichales, and synergistetes, were detected after the intervention. in summary, our results show that the intake of these three bacterial strains induced changes in the colon microbiota.

TI  == preparative scale purification of fucosyl-n-acetylglucosamine disaccharides and their evaluation as potential prebiotics and antiadhesins.
AB  == fucosyl-n-acetylglucosamine disaccharides are important core structures that form part of human mucosal and milk glyco-complexes. we have previously shown that alfb and alfc alpha-l-fucosidases from lactobacillus casei are able to synthesize fucosyl-alpha-1,3--n-acetylglucosamine (fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac) and fucosyl-alpha-1,6-n-acetylglucosamine (fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac), respectively, in transglycosylation reactions. here, these reactions were performed in a semipreparative scale, and the produced disaccharides were purified. the maximum  yields obtained of fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac and fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac were 4.2 and 9.3 g/l, respectively. the purified fucosyl-disaccharides were then analyzed for their prebiotic effect in vitro using strains from the lactobacillus casei/paracasei/rhamnosus group and from bifidobacterium species. the results revealed that 6 out of 11 l. casei strains and 2 out of 6 l. rhamnosus strains tested were able to ferment fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac, and l. casei bl87 and l. rhamnosus bl327 strains were also able to ferment fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac. dna hybridization experiments suggested that the metabolism of fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac in those strains relies in an alpha-l-fucosidase homologous to alfb. bifidobacterium breve and bibidobacterium pseudocatenolatum species also metabolized fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac. notably, l-fucose was excreted from all the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains fermenting fucosyl-disaccharides, except from strains l. rhamnosus bl358 and bl377, indicating that in these latest strains, l-fucose was catabolized. the fucosyl-disaccharides were also tested for their inhibitory  potential of pathogen adhesion to human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial (ht29) cell line. enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) strains isolated from infantile gastroenteritis were used, and the results showed that both fucosyl-disaccharides inhibited adhesion to different extents of certain epec strains to ht29 cells in tissue culture.

TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4034, bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 and lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-4036 on hepatic steatosis in zucker rats.
AB  == we have previously described the safety and immunomodulatory effects of lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4034, bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 and lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-4036 in healthy volunteers. the scope of this work was to evaluate the effects of these probiotic strains on the hepatic steatosis of obese rats. we used the zucker rat as a genetic model of obesity. zucker-lepr(fa/fa) rats received one of three probiotic strains, a mixture of l.  paracasei cncm i-4034 and b. breve cncm i-4035, or a placebo for 30 days. an additional group of zucker-lean+/fa rats received a placebo for 30 days. no alterations in intestinal histology, in the epithelial, lamina propria, muscular  layers of the ileal or colonic mucosa, or the submucosae, were observed in any of the experimental groups. triacylglycerol content decreased in the liver of zucker-lepr(fa/fa) rats that were fed l. rhamnosus, b. breve, or the mixture of b. breve and l. paracasei. likewise, the area corresponding to neutral lipids was significantly smaller in the liver of all four groups of zucker-lepr(fa/fa) rats  that received probiotics than in rats fed the placebo. zucker-lepr(fa/fa) rats exhibited significantly greater serum lps levels than zucker-lean+/fa rats upon administration of placebo for 30 days. in contrast, all four groups of obese zucker-lepr(fa/fa) rats that received lab strains exhibited serum lps concentrations similar to those of zucker-lean+/fa rats. serum tnf-alpha levels decreased in the zucker-lepr(fa/fa) rats that received b. breve, l. rhamnosus, or the mixture, whereas l. paracasei feeding decreased il-6 levels in the serum of zucker-lepr(fa/fa) rats. in conclusion, the probiotic strains reduced hepatic steatosis in part by lowering serum lps, and had an anti-inflammatory effect in obese zucker rats.

TI  == bifidobacterium breve attenuates murine dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis and increases regulatory t cell responses.
AB  == while some probiotics have shown beneficial effects on preventing or treating colitis development, others have shown no effects. in this study, we have assessed the immunomodulating effects of two probiotic strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus) and bifidobacterium breve (b. breve) on t cell polarization in vitro, using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), and in vivo, using murine dextran sodium sulfate (dss) colitis model. with respect to the latter, the mrna expression of t cell subset-associated transcription factors and cytokines in the colon was measured and the t helper type (th) 17 and regulatory t cell (treg) subsets were determined in the peyer's patches. both l.  rhamnosus and b. breve incubations in vitro reduced th17 and increased th2 cell subsets in human pbmcs. in addition, b. breve incubation was also able to reduce  th1 and increase treg cell subsets in contrast to l. rhamnosus. in vivo intervention with b. breve, but not l. rhamnosus, significantly attenuated the severity of dss-induced colitis. in dss-treated c57bl/6 mice, intervention with b. breve increased the expression of mrna encoding for th2- and treg-associated cytokines in the distal colon. in addition, intervention with b. breve led to increases of treg and decreases of th17 cell subsets in peyer's patches of dss-treated mice. b. breve modulates t cell polarization towards th2 and treg cell-associated responses in vitro and in vivo. in vivo b. breve intervention ameliorates dss-induced colitis symptoms and this protective effect may mediated  by its effects on the t-cell composition.

TI  == bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus rhamnosus treatment is as effective as budesonide at reducing inflammation in a murine model for chronic asthma.
AB  == background: asthma is estimated to affect as many as 300 million people worldwide and its incidence and prevalence are rapidly increasing throughout the world, especially in children and within developing countries. recently, there has been  a growing interest in the use of potentially beneficial bacteria for allergic diseases. this study is aimed at exploring the therapeutic effects of long-term treatment with two different beneficial bacterial strains (bifidobacterium breve  m-16 v and lactobacillus rhamnosus nutres1) and a glucocorticoid (budesonide), as a reference treatment, on inflammatory response in a murine model for chronic allergic asthma. methods: to mimic the chronic disease in asthmatic patients, we  used the murine ovalbumin-induced asthma model combined with prolonged allergen exposure. airway function; pulmonary airway inflammation; airway remodelling, mrna expression of pattern recognition receptors, th-specific cytokines and transcription factors in lung tissue; mast cell degranulation; in vitro t cell activation; and expression of foxp3 in blood th cells were examined. results: lactobacillus rhamnosus reduced lung resistance to a similar extent as budesonide treatment in chronically asthmatic mice. pulmonary airway inflammation, mast cell degranulation, t cell activation and airway remodelling were suppressed by all treatments. beneficial bacteria and budesonide differentially modulated the expression of toll-like receptors (tlrs), nod-like receptors (nlrs), cytokines and t cell transcription factors. bifidobacterium breve induced regulatory t cell responses in the airways by increasing il10 and foxp3 transcription in lung tissue as well as systemic by augmenting the mean fluorescence intensity of foxp3 in blood cd4+ t cells. conclusion: these findings show that bifidobacterium breve m-16 v and lactobacillus rhamnosus nutres1 have strong anti-inflammatory properties that are comparable to budesonide and therefore may be beneficial in the treatment of chronic asthma.

TI  == extracellular vesicles modulate host-microbe responses by altering tlr2 activity  and phagocytosis.
AB  == oral delivery of gram positive bacteria, often derived from the genera lactobacillus or bifidobacterium, can modulate immune function. although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, immunomodulatory effects may be elicited through the direct interaction of these bacteria with the intestinal epithelium or resident dendritic cell (dc) populations. we analyzed the immune activation properties of lactobacilli and bifidobacterium species and made the surprising observation that cellular responses in vitro were differentially influenced by the presence of serum, specifically the extracellular vesicle (ev) fraction. in contrast to the tested lactobacilli species, tested bifidobacterium species induce tlr2/6 activity which is inhibited by the presence of evs. using specific  tlr ligands, evs were found to enhance cellular tlr2/1 and tlr4 responses while tlr2/6 responses were suppressed. no effect could be observed on cellular tlr5 responses. we determined that evs play a role in bacterial aggregation, suggesting that evs interact with bacterial surfaces. evs were found to slightly  enhance dc phagocytosis of bifidobacterium breve whereas phagocytosis of lactobacillus rhamnosus was virtually absent upon serum ev depletion. dc uptake of a non-microbial substance (dextran) was not affected by the different serum fractions suggesting that evs do not interfere with dc phagocytic capacity but rather modify the dc-microbe interaction. depending on the microbe, combined effects of evs on tlr activity and phagocytosis result in a differential proinflammatory dc cytokine release. overall, these data suggest that evs play a  yet unrecognized role in host-microbe responses, not by interfering in recipient  cellular responses but via attachment to, or scavenging of, microbe-associated molecular patterns. evs can be found in any tissue or bodily fluid, therefore insights into ev-microbe interactions are important in understanding the mechanism of action of potential probiotics and gut immune homeostasis.

TI  == cohort study of probiotics in a north american neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine whether routine probiotic administration to very preterm  infants would reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) without adverse consequences. study design: since the end of july 2011, we have administered a probiotic mixture to all admitted infants of <32 weeks' gestation. we give 0.5 g of a mixture of 4 bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium breve, bifidum, infantis, and longum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus ha-111 [corrected] (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units) per day, starting with the first feed, until the infant reaches 34 weeks. we compared complications among infants admitted during the first 17 months of routine use with those admitted during the previous 17 months. results: two hundred ninety-four infants received probiotics, and 317 infants formed the comparison group. introduction of probiotics was associated with a reduction in nec (from 9.8% to 5.4%, p < .02), a nonsignificant decrease in death (9.8% to 6.8%), and a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or nec (from 17% to 10.5%, p < .05). after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, and sex, the improvements remained significant (or for nec, 0.51; 95% ci, 0.26-0.98; or for death or nec, 0.56; 95% ci, 0.33-0.93). there was no effect of probiotics on health care-associated infection. discussion: a product that is readily available in north america, that has excellent quality control, and that contains strains similar to those that have been shown effective in randomized controlled trials substantially reduced the frequency of nec in our neonatal intensive care unit.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria against clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) has become a significant threat to public health. although broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is the primary treatment option for cdi, its use has evident limitations. probiotics have been proved to be effective in the treatment of cdi and are a promising therapeutic option for cdi. in this study, 4 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), namely, lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr5), lactococcuslactis (sl3), bifidobacterium breve (br3), and bifidobacterium lactis (bl3) were evaluated for their anti-c. difficile activity. co-culture incubation of c. difficile (10(6) and 10(10) cfu/ml) with each strain of lab indicated that sl3 possessed the highest antimicrobial activity over a 24-hr period. the cell-free supernatants of the 4 lab strains exhibited mic50 values between 0.424 mg/ml (sl3) and 1.318 (br3) mg/ml. these results may provide a basis for alternative therapies for the treatment of c. difficile-associated gut disorders.

TI  == safety and immunomodulatory effects of three probiotic strains isolated from the  feces of breast-fed infants in healthy adults: setoprob study.
AB  == we previously described the isolation and characterization of three probiotic strains from the feces of exclusively breast-fed newborn infants: lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4034, bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 and lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-4036. these strains were shown to adhere to intestinal mucus in  vitro, to be sensitive to antibiotics and to resist biliary salts and low ph. in  the present study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 100 healthy volunteers in three spanish cities was carried out to evaluate the tolerance, safety, gut colonization and immunomodulatory effects of  these three probiotics. volunteers underwent a 15-day washout period, after which they were randomly divided into 5 groups that received daily a placebo, a capsule containing one of the 3 strains or a capsule containing a mixture of two strains  for 30 days. the intervention was followed by another 15-day washout period. patients did not consume fermented milk for the entire duration of the study. gastrointestinal symptoms, defecation frequency and stool consistency were not altered by probiotic intake. no relevant changes in blood and serum, as well as no adverse events occurred during or after treatment. probiotic administration slightly modified bacterial populations in the volunteers' feces. intestinal persistence occurred in volunteers who received l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036. administration of b. breve cncm i-4035 resulted in a significant increase in fecal secretory iga content. il-4 and il-10 increased, whereas il-12 decreased in the serum of volunteers treated with any of the three strains. these results demonstrate that the consumption of these three bacterial strains was safe and exerted varying degrees of immunomodulatory effects. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct01479543.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: we are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. objective: this study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. methods: this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. the multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) cfu), l. casei (7 x 10(9) cfu), l. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), l. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) cfu), bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) cfu), b. longum (7 x 10(9) cfu), streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (gsh). results: between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in fpg (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group  and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. we observed a significant increase in homa-ir (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). mean changes in serum hs-crp were significantly different between the two  groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group,  p = 0.02). probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma gsh  levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). conclusion:  in conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in fpg and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-crp and an increase in plasma total gsh.

TI  == competitive inhibition of three novel bacteria isolated from faeces of breast milk-fed infants against selected enteropathogens.
AB  == numerous in vitro and in vivo studies conducted using different probiotic micro-organisms have demonstrated their ability to interfere with the growth and  virulence of a variety of enteropathogens. the reported beneficial effects of the use of probiotics to complement antibiotic therapy or prevent diarrhoea or gastrointestinal infection in infants have increased in recent years. in the present study, we demonstrated the capacity of supernatants obtained from three novel probiotics (lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4034, bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 and lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-4036) isolated from the faeces of breastfed infants to inhibit the growth of enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic (epec) bacteria, such as escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella. to assess their potential antimicrobial activity, the 17 and 24 h cell-free supernatants broth concentrates (10x) having 1, 2 or 4 % of the three probiotics were incubated with epec bacteria strains. after 17 h of co-culture, the supernatants  were able to inhibit the growth of e. coli, salmonella and shigella up to 40, 55  and 81 %, respectively. however, the inhibitory capacity of some supernatants was maintained or completely lost when the supernatants (ph 3.0) were neutralised (ph 6.5). overall, these results demonstrated that l. paracasei cncm i-4034, b. breve cncm i-4035 and l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036 produce compounds that exhibited strain-specific inhibition of enterobacteria and have the potential to be used as probiotics in functional foods.

TI  == isolation, identification and characterisation of three novel probiotic strains (lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4034, bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 and lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-4036) from the faeces of exclusively breast-fed infants.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to isolate, identify and characterise novel strains of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria with probiotic properties from the faeces of exclusively breast-fed infants. of the 4680 isolated colonies, 758  exhibited resistance to low ph and tolerance to high concentrations of bile salts; of these, only forty-two exhibited a strong ability to adhere to enterocytes in vitro. the identities of the isolates were confirmed by 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) sequencing, which permitted the grouping of the forty-two bacteria into three different strains that showed more than 99 % sequence identity with lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium breve, respectively. the strain identification was confirmed by sequencing the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer regions. strains were assayed for enzymatic activity and carbohydrate utilisation, and they were deposited in the collection nationale de cultures de microorganismes (cncm) of the institute pasteur and named l. paracasei cncm i-4034, b. breve cncm i-4035 and l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036. the strains were susceptible to antibiotics and did not produce undesirable metabolites, and their safety was assessed by acute ingestion in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed balb/c mouse models. the three novel strains inhibited in vitro the meningitis aetiological agent listeria monocytogenes and human rotavirus infections. b. breve cncm i-4035 led to a higher iga concentration in faeces and plasma of mice. overall, these results suggest that l. paracasei cncm i-4034, b. breve cncm i-4035 and l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036 should be considered as probiotic strains, and their human health benefits should be further evaluated.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

AB  == background: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are often associated with health-promoting effects. these live microorganisms, defined as probiotics, are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurt and fermented milks, or as dietary supplements. escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. as a part of the normal gut microbiota, this microorganism colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans within a few hours after birth. all  e. coli strains can produce a wide variety of biogenic amines responsible for potentially harmful systemic intoxications. enterohemorrhagic e. coli serotype o157:h7 is a pathotype of diarrhoeagenic strains with a large virulence plasmid po157 able to produce 1 or more shiga toxins. methods: the overall aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of different strains of probiotics  on e. coli serotypes, including e. coli o157:h7 (cq9485). in particular, the antagonistic activity of 4 bifidobacterium strains (probiotical spa, italy) and 16 lactic acid bacteria, more specifically 14 lactobacillus spp. and 2 streptococcus spp., was assessed against selected e. coli biotypes (atcc 8739, atcc 10536, atcc 35218, and atcc 25922). the diarrhoeagenic serotype o157:h7 was  also tested. results: the experimental data collected demonstrated an in vitro significant inhibitory effect of 6 lactobacillus strains, namely l. rhamnosus lr04, l. rhamnosus lr06, l. plantarum lp01, l. plantarum lp02, l. pentosus lps01, and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01, and 2 bifidobacterium strains, b. breve br03 and b. breve b632. the inhibiting extent was slightly different among  these strains, with l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01 showing the highest activity on e. coli o157:h7. conclusions: most of the probiotics studied are able to antagonize the growth of the 5 strains of e. coli tested, including the o157:h7 biotype, well known for their characteristic to produce a wide variety of biogenic amines considered responsible for dangerous systemic intoxications.

TI  == characterization of a panela cheese with added probiotics and fava bean starch.
AB  == of 20 lactobacillus and 8 bifidobacterium species examined, only bifidobacterium  breve atcc 15700 was able to ferment starch from fava beans. bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg atcc 53103 were selected as probiotics for use in fresh-style panela cheese. two types of fresh cheese (with  and without 3% fava bean starch) were manufactured with 3 combinations of probiotics: l. rhamnosus gg only, b. breve only, or both l. rhamnosus gg and b. breve. during 4 wk of storage at 4 degrees c, the addition of fava bean starch to the cheese was not found to cause significant differences in the viability of either probiotic strain. however, the microstructure and texture of panela cheese were altered, resulting in a much softer product. a sensory panel showed that the presence of added fava bean starch in panela cheese was less desirable to consumers, whereas probiotic supplementation had no effect on perceived taste or  appearance. panela cheese could be a suitable food for inclusion of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == modulation of toll-like receptor ligands and candida albicans-induced cytokine responses by specific probiotics.
AB  == probiotics have been proposed as modulators of gut inflammation, especially in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). in order to be able to use them in these clinical conditions, their capacity to modulate immune responses towards other stimuli or microorganisms has to be thoroughly understood. in the present study,  three different potentially probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (numres 204), lactobacillus rhamnosus (numres1) and lactobacillus casei (dn-114 001), have been studied for their potential to modulate responses to stimulation with pure pattern-recognition receptor (prr) ligands or to the gut commensal fungus candida albicans. cytokine production induced by prr ligands or c. albicans was assessed in conditions of simultaneous stimulation or preincubation of primary immune cells with bifidobacterium or lactobacillus spp. results indicate that simultaneous stimulation leads to potentiation of il-1beta and il-6 production, while the tnfalpha and ifn-gamma production was inhibited. in settings of pre-incubation with these potentially probiotic strains, lower production of tnfalpha was observed in the presence of b. breve. moreover, c. albicans-induced  il-17 production was decreased after pre-incubation with both bifidobacterium or  lactobacillus probiotic strains. whereas c. albicans induced cytokines are dampened by the tested probiotic strains, tnfalpha and il-6 production by pure pattern-recognition receptor ligands are potentiated. interestingly, an important role of toll-like receptor 9 signalling that involves jnk kinase in the modulatory effects of these probiotic strains has been identified. in conclusion, specific probiotic strains exhibit cross-tolerance effects towards other inflammatory stimuli, especially c. albicans, which might have beneficial effects on gut inflammation.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: the clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is still controversial. aims: we aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on ibs symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with  diarrhea-dominant ibs (d-ibs). methods: fifty patients with d-ibs were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 cfu) groups. treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. the primary outcome was adequate relief (ar) of overall ibs symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. a responder was defined as a patient who experienced ar for at least half of the 10-week study period. secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and ibs quality of life. the fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: the proportion of ar was consistently higher in  the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (p<0.05). the proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, p=0.01). stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but ibs quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after  treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, p=0.005). conclusions: the probiotic mixture was effective in providing ar of overall ibs symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in d-ibs patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. the therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the  stabilization of intestinal microbiota.

TI  == human bocavirus in the nasopharynx of otitis-prone children.
AB  == objectives: human bocavirus (hbov) is frequently identified in children with respiratory tract infections, and its role in acute otitis media (aom) has been suggested. the disease associations for the closely related bocaviruses hbov2-4 remain unknown. increasing evidence shows that probiotics may reduce the risk of  aom of viral origin. objectives of the study was to examine the prevalence and persistence of bocaviruses in consecutive nasopharyngeal samples (nps) of otitis-prone children, and whether an association exists between hbov and the child's characteristics, respiratory symptoms, and aom pathogens, and whether probiotics reduce the occurrence of hbov. methods: in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 6-month intervention study, 269 otitis-prone children (aged 9 months to 5.6 years), consumed daily either one capsule of probiotics (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii js) or placebo. after a clinical examination and nps collected at three-time points, the presence and persistence  of hbov1-4 dna in nps was determined by rt-qpcr at the baseline, after 3, and 6 months. results: a high load (>10,000 copies/ml) of hbov dna was detected in 26 (17.1%) of 152 children, and 16 (10.5%) showed a prolonged presence of hbov for at least 3 months. none had dna of hbov2-4. higher number of siblings associated  with increased hbov prevalence (p=0.029). prevalence or persistence of hbov was not significantly associated with other characteristics, respiratory symptoms, or aom pathogens. probiotic intervention significantly reduced the number of hbov dna-positive samples (probiotic vs. placebo: 6.4% vs. 19.0%, or=0.25, ci 95%=0.07-0.94, p=0.039). conclusions: hbov, but not hbov2-4, dna occurs often in  the nasopharynx of otitis-prone children, and may persist for 3-6 months. probiotic treatment possibly reduced the presence of hbov.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == a probiotic mixture including galactooligosaccharides decreases fecal beta-glucosidase activity but does not affect serum enterolactone concentration in men during a two-week intervention.
AB  == a high serum concentration of enterolactone, an enterolignan produced by colonic  microbiota from precursors in cereals, vegetables, and fruits, is associated with reduced risk of acute coronary events. probiotics and prebiotics modify colonic metabolism and may affect the serum enterolactone concentration. the effects of a probiotic mixture alone and with galactooligosaccharides (gos) on serum enterolactone concentration and fecal metabolism were investigated in 18 healthy  men. participants received 3 interventions, each for 2 wk: 1) probiotics [lactobacillus rhamnosus strains gg (lgg) and lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js, and bifidobacterium breve bb99, for a total amount of 2 x 10(10) cfu/d]; 2) probiotics and gos 3.8 g/d; 3) probiotics, gos, and rye bread (minimum 120 g/d). serum enterolactone and fecal dry weight, enzyme activities, ph, scfa, lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria, propionibacteria, and the strains lgg and lc705 were determined. the serum enterolactone concentration  (nmol/l) tended to be decreased from baseline [mean (95% ci) 18.6 (10.8-26.4)] by probiotics alone [15.2 (7.8-22.7); p = 0.095], was not significantly affected by  probiotics with gos [21.5 (13.2-29.8)], and was increased by probiotics with gos  and rye bread [24.6 (15.4-33.7); p < 0.05]. probiotics alone did not affect fecal beta-glucosidase activity and bifidobacteria, but probiotics with gos decreased beta-glucosidase activity and increased bifidobacteria compared with baseline (p  < 0.05) and with probiotics alone (p < 0.01). in conclusion, this probiotic mixture with or without gos does not significantly affect serum enterolactone concentration. because probiotics with gos decreased fecal beta-glucosidase activity but not serum enterolactone, the reduced fecal beta-glucosidase, within  the range of activities measured, does not seem to limit the formation of enterolactone.

TI  == differential toll-like receptor recognition and induction of cytokine profile by  bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus strains of probiotics.
AB  == the use of probiotics as a food supplement has gained tremendous interest in the  last few years as beneficial effects were reported in gut homeostasis and nutrient absorption but also in immunocompromised patients, supporting protection from colonization or infection with pathogenic bacteria or fungi. as a treatment  approach for inflammatory bowel diseases, a suitable probiotic strain would ideally be one with a low immunogenic potential. insight into the immunogenicities and types of t-cell responses induced by potentially probiotic strains allows a more rational selection of a particular strain. in the present study, the bacterial strains bifidobacterium breve (numres 204), lactobacillus rhamnosus (numres1), and lactobacillus casei (dn-114 001) were compared concerning their capacity to induce inflammatory responses in terms of cytokine production by human and mouse primary immune cells. it was demonstrated that the  b. breve strain induced lower levels of the proinflammatory cytokine gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) than the tested l. rhamnosus and l. casei strains. both b. breve and lactobacilli induced cytokines in a toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9)-dependent manner, while the lower inflammatory profile of b. breve was due to inhibitory effects of tlr2. no role for tlr4, nod2, and c-type lectin receptors was apparent. in conclusion, tlr signaling is involved in the differentiation of inflammatory responses between probiotic strains used as food  supplements.

TI  == the effect of rice fibre fractions on the growth of co-cultures of probiotics.
AB  == the fermentation of rice dietary fibre was measured by the cell yield, ph, optical density specific growth rate and biomass using nine co-cultures of four probiotics at 0, 6, 24 and 48 h incubation. the results from the fermentation of  the soluble, insoluble and total dietary fibre (sdf, idf, and tdf) of two rice varieties were compared. overall there was no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the fermentation of the six different rice fibre fractions. however, co-cultures showed a preference for glucose as a fermentation substrate rather than the fibre fractions. bifidobacteria species produced a higher cell count than the lactobacillus species after 24 and 48 h of fermentation (p < 0.05). there was evidence of synergistic activity with increased growth observed when lactobacilli and bifidobacterium were grown together. growth was limited by the ph reaching 4.2-4.45. specific growth rates of the co-cultures varied for different culture combinations. combinations of the same species produced less biomass than combinations of mixed species. bifidobacterium breve + bifidobacterium longum + lactobacillus rhamnosus was the most efficient. these findings showed that synergism between microorganisms in co-cultures affected the degree of fermentation of dietary fibre.

TI  == effect of a multispecies probiotic supplement on quantity of irritable bowel syndrome-related intestinal microbial phylotypes.
AB  == background: probiotics can alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), possibly by stabilizing the intestinal microbiota. our aim was to determine whether ibs-associated bacterial alterations were reduced during multispecies probiotic intervention consisting of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l.  rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99. the intervention has previously been shown to successfully alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms of ibs. methods: the faecal microbiotas of 42 ibs subjects participating in a placebo-controlled double-blind multispecies probiotic intervention were analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). eight bacterial targets within the gastrointestinal microbiota with a putative ibs association were measured. results: a phylotype with 94% similarity to ruminococcus torques remained abundant in the placebo group, but was decreased in the probiotic group during the intervention (p = 0.02 at 6 months). in addition, the clostridial phylotype,  clostridium thermosuccinogenes 85%, was stably elevated during the intervention (p = 0.00 and p = 0.02 at 3 and 6 months, respectively). the bacterial alterations detected were in accordance with previously discovered alleviation of symptoms. conclusions: the probiotic supplement was thus shown to exert specific  alterations in the ibs-associated microbiota towards the bacterial 16s rdna phylotype quantities described previously for subjects free of ibs. these changes may have value as non-invasive biomarkers in probiotic intervention studies.

TI  == a bifidobacterium probiotic strain and its soluble factors alleviate chloride secretion by human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == previous studies indicate that certain probiotic bacterial strains or their soluble products can alleviate proinflammatory cytokine secretion by intestinal epithelial cells (iec), but their impact on epithelial chloride (cl(-)) secretion remains elusive. to further decipher the mechanisms of the cross-talk between bacteria/soluble factors and epithelial cells, we analyzed the capacity of the probiotic strain bifidobacterium breve c50 (bb c50), its conditioned medium, and  other commensal gram (+) bacteria to modulate epithelial cl(-) secretion. the effect of bb c50 on carbachol- (cch) or forskolin (fsk)-induced cl(-) secretion was measured in an iec line in ussing chambers. the mechanisms involved in the regulation of cl(-) secretion were assessed by measuring intracellular ca(2+) concentration, phosphatase activity, protein kinase (pk) c and pka activation, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) expression. cch- or fsk-induced cl(-) secretion [short-circuit current (isc): 151 +/- 28 and 98 +/- 14 microa/cm(2), respectively] was inhibited dose-dependently by bb c50 (isc  33 +/- 12 and 49 +/- 7 microa/cm(2) at multiplicity of infection 100; p < 0.02).  fsk-induced cl(-) secretion was also inhibited by lactobacillus rhamnosus 10893.  no other inhibitory effect was recorded with the other gram (+) bacteria tested.  the inhibitory effect of bb c50 on cch-induced cl(-) secretion targeted a step downstream of epithelial ca(2+) mobilization and was associated with decreased pkc activity. thus, bb c50 and secreted soluble factors, by inhibiting phosphorylation processes, may promote intestinal homeostasis by controlling cl(-) secretion.

AB  == background/aim: evidence demonstrating an important role of the intestinal microbiota in the incidence of allergic disorders has led to the concept of using probiotics as possible antiallergic therapy. this study aimed to select a bacterial strain with the best antiallergic treatment effects from a panel of 6 bacterial strains in a mouse model of ovalbumin(ova)-allergic asthma. methods: ova-sensitized balb/c mice were orally administered the bacterial strains bifidobacterium breve m-16v, b. infantis numres251, b. animalis numres252 and numres253, lactobacillus plantarum numres8 and l. rhamnosus numres6. after challenge by ova inhalation in the lungs, the response to methacholine was measured. pulmonary inflammation was assessed by analyzing bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for the presence of eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes and for interleukin 4, interleukin 5, interleukin 10 and interferon-gamma. ova-specific ige, igg1 and igg2a were measured in serum. next, the effect on acute allergic skin reaction was measured after treatment with b. breve m-16v and l. plantarum numres8. results: of the panel of 6 strains, b. breve m-16v and l. plantarum numres8 inhibited (1) the response to methacholine, (2) reduced the number of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, (3) reduced both ova-specific ige and (4) ova-specific igg1, whereas the other strains did not affect all these parameters simultaneously. b. breve m-16v but not l. plantarum numres8 reduced interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interleukin 10. furthermore, b.  breve m-16v but not l. plantarum numres8 reduced acute allergic skin reactions to ova. conclusion: b. breve m-16v was identified as the most potent antiallergic strain.

TI  == top-down systems biology integration of conditional prebiotic modulated transgenomic interactions in a humanized microbiome mouse model.
AB  == gut microbiome-host metabolic interactions affect human health and can be modified by probiotic and prebiotic supplementation. here, we have assessed the effects of consumption of a combination of probiotics (lactobacillus paracasei or l. rhamnosus) and two galactosyl-oligosaccharide prebiotics on the symbiotic microbiome-mammalian supersystem using integrative metabolic profiling and modeling of multiple compartments in germ-free mice inoculated with a model of human baby microbiota. we have shown specific impacts of two prebiotics on the microbial populations of hbm mice when co-administered with two probiotics. we observed an increase in the populations of bifidobacterium longum and b. breve, and a reduction in clostridium perfringens, which were more marked when combining prebiotics with l. rhamnosus. in turn, these microbial effects were associated with modulation of a range of host metabolic pathways observed via changes in lipid profiles, gluconeogenesis, and amino-acid and methylamine metabolism associated to fermentation of carbohydrates by different bacterial strains. these results provide evidence for the potential use of prebiotics for beneficially modifying the gut microbial balance as well as host energy and lipid homeostasis.

TI  == effects of multispecies probiotic combination on helicobacter pylori infection in vitro.
AB  == probiotic bacteria alleviate many gastrointestinal symptoms, but the current trend of combining bacteria for additional benefit may make their effects more complex. we characterize four probiotics and their combination in terms of pathogen adhesion, barrier function, cell death, and inflammatory response in helicobacter pylori-infected epithelial cells. h. pylori-infected caco-2 cells were pretreated with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, bifidobacterium breve bb99, or all four organisms in combination. we evaluated the adhesion of h. pylori by in situ immunofluorescence; epithelial barrier function by measurement of transepithelial resistance; apoptosis by measurement of caspase 3 activation; cell membrane leakage by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release; and inflammation by measurement of interleukin-8 (il-8), il-10, prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), and leukotriene b(4) (ltb(4)) release. all probiotics inhibited h. pylori adhesion. l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, and the combination inhibited h. pylori-induced cell membrane leakage. l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and the combination initially improved epithelial barrier function but increased the h. pylori-induced barrier  deterioration after incubation for 24 to 42 h. l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js inhibited h. pylori-induced il-8 release, whereas l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and b. breve bb99 suppressed pge(2) release. none of these anti-inflammatory effects persisted when the probiotics were used in combination. the combination thus increased the levels of il-8, pge(2), and ltb(4) released from h. pylori-infected epithelial cells. the proinflammatory actions of the individual components dominated the anti-inflammatory effects when the probiotic bacteria were used in combination. our results stress that the therapeutic response can be optimized if probiotic strains are characterized before they are used in combination.

TI  == fecal microflora of greek healthy neonates.
AB  == this study aimed to explore, in our geographical region, the development of intestinal microflora and the colonization patterns of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria during the first three months of life and to investigate the effect of the mode of delivery. fecal specimens from 82 healthy, full-term infants were collected prospectively 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery and subcultured on nonselective and selective media. identification of isolates was performed by microbiological and molecular methods. for the delivery effect, two  groups of vaginally or caesarean-delivered exclusively breast-fed infants were studied. despite the early high total counts of aerobes and anaerobes, colonization of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria was overall limited until 3 months of age. furthermore, caesarean-delivered infants were less often colonized with lactobacilli at day 4 (4% vs. 59%, p = 0.000) and with bifidobacteria at day 4 (0% vs. 23%, p = 0.015) and 30 (0% vs. 35%, p = 0.042) compared to vaginally delivered ones. no bacterial populations differences were detected to compare colonized infants. identification results indicated the predominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus paracasei species in neonatal gut microflora up to the first month of life and diversity of lactobacillus species in vaginally delivered, colonized newborns, at fourth day.  furthermore, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium breve were the most frequently detected bifidobacterium species in vaginally delivered, breast-fed infants. in conclusion our study revealed a restricted colonization pattern of lactic acid bacteria in greek infants and a delay in the development of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium spp. microbiota after caesarean section. further analysis of potential consequences of these findings is required.

TI  == effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == background: a multispecies probiotic has shown beneficial effects in irritable bowel syndrome. in addition, certain other probiotics have demonstrated advantageous effects, but the mechanisms behind this are poorly understood. aim:  to investigate the mode of action of a multispecies probiotic consisting of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99 by monitoring its effects on intestinal microbiota and markers of microbial activity. methods: a total of 55 irritable bowel syndrome patients participated in this placebo-controlled double-blind trial. subjects received either multispecies probiotic or placebo supplementation daily during a 6-month period. the composition of intestinal microbiota was analysed with real-time polymerase chain reaction, short-chain fatty acids with gas chromatography and enzymes with spectrophotometer. results: each supplemented probiotic strain was detected in faecal samples. intestinal microbiota remained stable during the trial, except for bifidobacterium spp., which increased in the placebo group and decreased in the probiotic group (p = 0.028). no changes in short-chain fatty acids occurred.  a decrease in ss-glucuronidase activity was detected in 67% of the subjects in the probiotic group vs. 38% in the placebo group (p = 0.06). conclusions: factors other than the microbial groups and metabolites studied herein seem responsible for the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms by the multispecies probiotic.

AB  == background & aims: to examine whether probiotics would reduce the occurrence or duration of acute otitis media (aom), or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. methods: during this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week intervention, 309 otitis-prone children (10 months-6 years) consumed either one probiotic capsule (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii js) (n=155) or placebo (n=154) daily. clinical examinations were carried out and nasopharyngeal samples taken three times. parents recorded the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (uri) in a diary. results: probiotic treatment did not reduce the occurrence (probiotic vs. placebo: 72% vs. 65%, or=1.48, 95% ci 0.87-2.52, p=n.s.) or the recurrence ( three) of aom episodes (18% vs. 17%, or=1.04, 95% ci 0.55-1.96, p=n.s.). the median duration of aom episodes was 5.6 (iqr 3.5-9.4) vs. 6.0 (iqr 4.0-10.5) days, respectively (p= n.s.). there was a tendency showing a reduction in the occurrence of recurrent (4 to 6) respiratory infections in the probiotic group (or for 4 uris: 0.56, 95%ci 0.31-0.99, p=0.046; or for 6 uris: 0.59, 95% ci 0.34 to 1.03, p=n.s.). probiotics did not affect the carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae, but increased the prevalence of moraxella catarrhalis (or=1.79, 95% ci 1.06-3.00, p=0.028). conclusions: probiotics did not prevent the occurrence of aom or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children.  a tendency showing a reduction in recurrent respiratory infections must be confirmed in further studies.

TI  == effects of anti-helicobacter pylori treatment and probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the aims of this study were (i) to evaluate the effect of recommended antimicrobial treatment of helicobacter pylori infection, consisting of clarithromycin, amoxicillin and lansoprazole, on intestinal microbiota and (ii) to determine the ability of a probiotic combination containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99 to prevent treatment-induced alterations in the intestinal microbiota. faecal samples were obtained from 39 h. pylori-infected patients randomised into two treatment groups. in addition, 19 h. pylori-negative volunteers were included in the study as a control group. samples were collected  before, during and after treatment and microbiota were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and culture. the quantities of the predominant bacterial groups were altered significantly in both groups and disturbances were seen even  9 weeks after treatment was complete. probiotics slightly counteracted the effects of anti-h. pylori treatment, seen as significantly less alterations in the total numbers of aerobes and lactobacilli/enterococci. at baseline, the composition of the microbiota between h. pylori-positive versus h. pylori-negative control individuals differed with regard to clostridia and the total number of anaerobes. the recommended treatment for h. pylori infection induces long-term disturbances in the intestinal microbiota. the probiotic combination appeared to result in only minor changes in the microbiota.

TI  == clinical studies on alleviating the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is one of the most common diagnoses in gastroenterology, but current therapies are inefficient. recent clinical trials suggest beneficial effects of certain probiotics in ibs. because of the heterogeneity of ibs a probiotic combination may be more efficient than a single  strain. we screened for optimal strains, and developed a multispecies probiotic combination consisting of l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, p. freudenreichii  ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99. the clinical efficacy of the probiotic combination was evaluated in ibs patients in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled six-month intervention. during six months the subjects received daily either probiotic supplementation or placebo. ibs symptoms were followed by symptom diaries. the probiotic supplementation demonstrated significant value in reducing ibs symptoms. at the end of the study period the total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + rumbling) had reduced with 42% in probiotic group versus 6% for instance anti-inflammatory effects, balancing of the microbiota or motility-related effects induced by the probiotic. the probiotic activity may be enhanced by synergistic effects of the combination that each strain alone would not hold. in conclusion, we found a probiotic combination of lgg and three other strains to be effective in alleviating ibs symptoms.

TI  == protection mechanism of probiotic combination against human pathogens: in vitro adhesion to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == in this study we evaluated the ability of commercial strains (l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and p. freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js) in combination with b.  breve 99 or b. lactis bb12 to inhibit, displace and compete with model pathogens  in order to test their influence on the adhesion of selected pathogens to immobilized human intestinal mucus. our results demonstrate that specific probiotic combinations are able to enhance the inhibition percentages of pathogens adhesion to intestinal mucus when compared to individual strains. this  suggests that combinations of probiotic strains are useful and more effective in  inhibition of pathogen adhesion than individual strains. such combinations should be assessed in clinical studies in subjects where the intestinal microbiota aberrancies have been identified.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == effect of maternal consumption of lactobacillus gg on transfer and establishment  of fecal bifidobacterial microbiota in neonates.
AB  == background: establishment of the gut microbiota at birth provides a substantial source of microbial stimuli for the maturation of the immune system. deviations in this process precede the development of specific diseases providing the rationale for the use of probiotics to counteract them. objective: this study was designed to characterize both the mother-infant bifidobacteria transfer at birth  and the development of bifidobacteria microbiota during the first weeks of life in infants whose mothers received lactobacillus rhamnosus gg or placebo. methods: species-specific pcr was used to assess the fecal bifidobacterial composition of  mothers before and after delivery and in infants at 5 days and 3 weeks of age. results: bifidobacterium longum was the species most commonly found in the mothers. bifidobacterium catenulatum was the most prevalent group in infants at 5 days of age and b. longum the predominant species at 3 weeks. at 5 days of age, infants whose mothers received l. rhamnosus gg showed a significantly higher occurrence of b. breve and lower of b. adolescentis than those from the placebo group. in addition, l. rhamnosus gg consumption increased the bifidobacterial diversity in infants and reduced the bifidobacterium microbiota similarity between mother and infant. conclusions: these results indicate that specific changes in the transfer and initial establishment of bifidobacteria in neonates take place as consequence of the consumption of l. rhamnosus gg by the mothers.

TI  == effects of specific lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal permeability to macromolecules and the inflammatory condition.
AB  == non-live probiotic bacteria and their fermentation products can be used in milk-based formula intended for healthy infants. the effects of a milk formula fermented with bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus and heated/dehydrated to inactivate the micro-organisms have been reported over the last few years to decrease the intestinal permeability to macromolecules in experimental animals in vivo and more recently to down-regulate inflammatory condition in vitro. feeding guinea-pigs with such dehydrated fermented milk reinforced the intestinal barrier resistance to food proteins (hrp, beta-lactoglobulin). in addition, the products secreted by bacteria were capable  of inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced tnf-alpha secretion by human peripheral mononuclear blood cells. the active secretion products were resistant  to digestive enzymes and their anti-inflammatory properties were preserved after  transepithelial transport across the filter-grown intestinal epithelial cell line, especially in inflammatory conditions. the binding of lps to monocytes as well as nfkappab nuclear translocation leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription were inhibited by bacteria-culture supernatants. conclusion: b. breve and s. thermophilus used as non-live micro-organisms in fermented infant formula seem to induce a reduction in macromolecular absorption and release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect, which persists after intestinal transport. thus, specific lactic acid bacteria and their metabolites seem to affect positively the intestinal function.

TI  == a probiotic mixture alleviates symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome patients: a controlled 6-month intervention.
AB  == background: irritable bowel syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder of unknown aetiology. the effect of probiotics in this syndrome remains unclear. aim: to investigate whether a probiotic mixture containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, bifidobacterium breve bb99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii  ssp. shermanii js is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.  methods: a total of 103 patients fulfilling the rome i or ii criteria took part in this 6-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. the patients  received a probiotic capsule or a placebo capsule daily. gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were recorded. results: at the end the total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + borborygmi) was 7.7 (95% ci: -13.9 to -1.6) points lower in the probiotic group (p = 0.015). this represents a median reduction of 42% in the symptom score of the probiotic group compared with 6% in the placebo group. in individual symptoms, borborygmi was milder in the probiotic group (p = 0.008), and for the rest of the symptoms there was a non-significant trend. conclusions: the results indicate that this probiotic mixture is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. considering the high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and the lack of effective therapies, even a slight reduction in symptoms could have positive public health consequences.

TI  == probiotic supplementation improves tolerance to helicobacter pylori eradication therapy--a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized pilot study.
AB  == background: h. pylori is the major cause of chronic gastritis, and a risk factor  for peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. aim: to investigate the effect of probiotic  supplementation on the tolerance and efficacy of h. pylori eradication treatment  in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. methods: a total of 338  volunteers were screened for h. pylori infection. the eligibility criteria were met by 47 subjects whose h. pylori infection was verified at the outset and re-evaluated after the treatment by the 13c-urea breath test and by enzyme immunoassay serology. the subjects were randomized to receive probiotic therapy (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosuslc705, bifidobacterium breve bb99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js) or a placebo during h. pylori eradication and for 3 weeks following the treatment, and recorded their daily symptoms in a standardized diary. results: when the frequencies of new or aggravated symptoms were evaluated, no significant differences were found between the two groups for individual symptoms. however, the probiotic group showed less  treatment-related symptoms as measured by the total symptom score change (p = 0.038) throughout the h. pylori eradication therapy in contrast to the placebo group. the h. pylori eradication rate was non-significantly higher in the group receiving probiotic therapy (91% vs. 79%, p = 0.42). in this group the recovery of probiotic bacteria in the faeces increased significantly (p < 0.001). conclusions: in this pilot study, probiotic supplementation did not diminish significantly the frequency of new or aggravated symptoms during h. pylori eradication. however, our data suggest an improved tolerance to the eradication treatment when total symptom severity was taken into account. furthermore, the results show that probiotic bacteria are able to survive in the gastrointestinal  tract despite the intensive antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
