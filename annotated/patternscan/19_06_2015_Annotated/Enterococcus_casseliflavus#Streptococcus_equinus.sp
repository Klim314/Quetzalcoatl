TI  == source of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese.
AB  == enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the  intestines of insects and birds. the source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is  unknown. in the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) was used to type 646 enterococcus strains which were isolated from a cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. nine different pfge patterns, three of enterococcus casseliflavus, five of enterococcus faecalis, and one of enterococcus durans, were found. the same three clones, one of e. faecalis and two of e. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. the two e. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. it is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as enterococcus faecium and streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk  or the cheese.

TI  == on the microbiological profile of traditional portuguese sourdough.
AB  == traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. to this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. more than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via biomerieux api galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. the dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequently isolated yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida pelliculosa. the most frequently isolated lab were (heterofermentative) leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) lactobacillus spp.; l. brevis, l. curvatus, and l. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the lactobacillus genera; lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; enterococcus casseliflavus, e. durans, and e. faecium for enterococci; and streptococcus constellantus and s. equinus for streptococci.

TI  == characterization of bacteriocins from enterococcus faecium with activity against  listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == laboratory cultures and environmental isolates of bacteria were screened for antagonism towards listeria monocytogenes using an agar spot test. seven of the 163 strains that were tested, one streptococcus bovis, one enterococcus casseliflavus, two e. avium and three e. faecium, consistently displayed antilisterial activity. cell-free, ph-neutralized supernatants prepared from the  three e. faecium strains (jbl1061, jbl1083 and jbl1351) exhibited strong antilisterial activity against l. monocytogenes, and were subjected to more detailed analyses. the antagonistic factors produced by these three strains were  sensitive to chloroform and several proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat (121 degrees c, 20 min), and stable over a wide ph range (3.0-10.0). moreover, they were listericidal without causing cell lysis. these data suggest that a bacteriocin(s) is involved in the inhibition of l. monocytogenes by e. faecium jbl1061, jbl1083 and jbl1351.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == the distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups d and n.
AB  == the isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups d and n were investigated. streptococcus faecalis, s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in s. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and s. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of s. cremoris, s. cremoris subsp. alactosus, s. lactis and s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. strains of s. avium, s. bovis, s. durans, s. equinus, s. faecium, s. raffinolactis and s. suis contained neither menaquinones  nor ubiquinones. the isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.

TI  == distribution of group d streptococci in rivers and streams.
AB  == a study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated  waters. media used to characterize and speciate group d streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (fc) and faecal streptococci (fs) in river water samples, the fc/fs ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. high concentrations of fc and fs from sediment samples  gave more credible fc/fs ratios. the actual distribution of group d streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. high concentrations of all division ii species (s. faecium, s. faecium var. casseliflavus, and s. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with s. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. low concentrations of division i  group d streptococci (s. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division iii group d streptococci (s. bovis and s. equinus) was made.
