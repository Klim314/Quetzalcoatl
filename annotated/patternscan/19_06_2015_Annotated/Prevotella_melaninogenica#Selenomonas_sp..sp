TI  == the bacteriology of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == plaque samples from 22 ulcerated sites in eight patients with anug were cultured  using quantitative anaerobic procedures and were examined microscopically. the partial characterization of the predominant cultivable flora revealed a constant  flora comprised of a limited number of bacterial types and a variable flora composed of a heterogeneous array of bacterial types. this constant flora would appear to be pathognomonic of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (anug) and  included the various treponema and selenomonas sp., which comprised about 32 and  6%, respectively, of the microscopic count; b. melaninogenicus ssp. intermedius and fusobacterium sp., which averaged 24 and 3%, respectively, of the viable count. one week of metronidazole treatment caused a prompt resolution of clinical symptoms, which coincided with a significant reduction in the plaque proportions  of the treponema sp., b. melaninogenicus ssp., intermedius and fusobacterium sp.  for at least 2 to 3 months following treatment. thus, the same anaerobic species  which were numerically associated with the anug lesion were also selectively reduced in the plaque flora following resolution of the infection. this supports  a role for the above species in the ulcerative stage of the lesion but does not demonstrate that these specific anaerobes initiated the infection. although not confirmed by the data, it was proposed that these particular anaerobic species gained ascendency in the plaque as a result of being selected through the availability of host-derived nutrients in individuals who had undergone certain physiological and psychological stresses.
