TI  == production and application of new monoclonal antibodies specific for a fecal helicobacter pylori antigen.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to establish monoclonal antibodies that could be used to produce a diagnostic test composed of one kind of monoclonal antibody recognizing a fecal helicobacter pylori antigen. the need to develop such a test  arose from disadvantages of the diagnostic test that uses a polyclonal antibody or plural kinds of monoclonal antibodies, such as the lower specificity for h. pylori antigen and the difficulty of reproduction with consistent quality. mice were immunized with sonicated cells of the coccoid form of h. pylori, and fecal samples from h. pylori-positive subjects were screened by a direct sandwich enzyme immunoassay (eia) for antibody production from 32 hybridoma clones. the three stable clones produced antibodies (21g2, 41a5, and 82b9) that reacted with  the same soluble antigen. gel filtration chromatography showed that the molecular masses of the cellular antigen and the fecal antigen were the same, 260 kda. the  antigen was labile in response to sodium dodecyl sulfate and heat treatments. a single-step direct sandwich eia using a single monoclonal antibody, 21g2, was developed. the eia could detect the antigen in 41 h. pylori clinical isolates and in fecal samples from seven h. pylori-positive subjects. several kinds of helicobacter species (helicobacter felis, helicobacter hepaticus, helicobacter mustelae, and helicobacter cinaedi) except h. pylori, major bacteria in feces (campylobacter jejuni, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and escherichia coli), and fecal samples from six h. pylori-negative subjects showed negative results. these results indicate that the new monoclonal antibodies and the new specific eia would be useful as a noninvasive method of diagnosis of h. pylori infection.

TI  == [detection of pyrazinamidase activity for differentiation of campylobacter, arcobacter, and helicobacter spp. by using a high-performance liquid chromatography method].
AB  == a high-performance liquid chromatography method was investigated for the detection pyrazinamidase activity by campylobacter, arcobacter, and helicobacter  spp. pyrazine carboxilic acid, one of the end products of pyrazinamide hydrolysis by microorganisms, was detected by using a high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). a loopful of organism colonies was emulsified in 0.5 ml of a 0.5% pyrazinamide solution. the suspens on was incubated in a 37 degrees c water bath  for 18-20 hr. after centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by hplc. this hplc method does not require microaerobic incubation and was easy to interpret for strains with weak enzymatic activity. by this method, we tested 111 clinical  isolates, type and reference strains of campylobacter spp., arcobacter spp., and  helicobacter spp. , c. jejuni, c. jejuni subsp. doylei, c. coli, c. upsaliensis,  c. lari, c. lari (urease+), c. helveticus, c. hyolei, c. sputorum subsp. fecalis, c. gracilis, c. concisus, c. curvus were positive for pyrazinamidase. c. fetus subsp. fetus, c. hyointestinalis, c. sputorum subsp. sputorum, c. sputorum subsp. bubulus, c. mucosalis, a. butzleri, a. skirrowii, a. cryaerophilus, h. pylori, h. cinaedi, h. fennelliae, h. mustelae, h. felis, h. muridarum, h. canis, h. nemestrinae, h. pamentensis, h. pullourum were negative.

TI  == direct analysis and identification of helicobacter and campylobacter species by maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter fetus, and campylobacter coli were compared with helicobacter pylori and helicobacter mustelae by direct analysis of individual cultured colonies in 50% methanol-water with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (maldi-tof ms). h. pylori  and campylobacter species from blood agar culture produced unique, complex spectra with over 25 different ions in mass/charge (m/z) range from 2,000 to 62,000. a biomarker for h. pylori was centered around m/z 58,268, and h. mustelae was distinguished from h. pylori by its ions at m/z 49,608 and 57,231. campylobacters could be distinguished from helicobacters by their lack of ions around m/z 58,000 and 61,000 as well as distinguishing biomarkers of lower m/z: 10,074 and 25,478 for c. coli; m/z 10,285 and 12,901 for c. jejuni; m/z 10,726 and 11,289 for c. fetus. maldi-tof ms is a rapid and direct method for detection  of these potentially pathogenic bacteria from culture.

TI  == fumarate hydration test for differentiation of campylobacter and helicobacter species.
AB  == a total of 65 campylobacter and helicobacter strains comprising 15 species were tested for fumarate hydration by using a rapid high-performance liquid chromatographic (hplc) method. all strains of c. jejuni, c. coli, c. jejuni subsp. doylei, c. fetus, c. hyointestinalis, c. lari, "c. lari variant", c. upsaliensis, h. fennelliae and h. pylori hydrated fumarate, whereas no strains of c. sputorum (all three biovars), h. cinaedi or h. mustelae did. l-malic acid was  detected in the supernatant of the cultures of all strains that hydrated fumarate, but not in the culture supernatant of any of the strains that failed to hydrate fumarate. these findings show that all campylobacter and helicobacter strains that hydrated fumarate were able to form l-malic acid from fumarate. hplc determination of organic acid is a rapid method that requires no chemical treatment before analysis. because it is reproducible, the hplc fumarate hydration test should be useful as conventional method for identification of campylobacter and helicobacter spp.

TI  == urease-mediated destruction of bacteria is specific for helicobacter urease and results in total cellular disruption.
AB  == the survival of helicobacter mustelae, proteus mirobilis, escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni in the presence of urea and citrate at ph 6.0 was examined.  h. mustelae, which has urease activity similar to h. pylori, had a markedly reduced survival, median 2.5% (0-78%) (p < 0.001) when incubated under these conditions. only 7% of the ammonia produced by h. mustelae urease activity was recovered from the buffer, a similar percentage to that previously reported with  h. pylori. none of the other organisms, all of which had lower urease activity, had impaired survival under these conditions. electron microscopical studies demonstrated extensive structural damage to h. pylori following exposure to urea  and citrate at ph 6.0. this structural damage to the organisms makes it unlikely  that the low recovery of ammonia was due to retention of ammonia within the bacteria and suggests that the ammonia may have been incorporated into glutamate  or other amino acids. incorporation of ammonia into these compounds would deplete the cell of the key metabolic intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate and could thus explain the mechanism of the urease-dependent destruction of the organism.

TI  == helicobacter acinonyx sp. nov., isolated from cheetahs with gastritis.
AB  == four strains of a novel helicobacter species were isolated from the stomachs of cheetahs (acinonyx jubilatus) with gastritis. these isolates were phenotypically  similar to helicobacter pylori. the isolates were gram-negative, spiral bacteria  which grew under microaerophilic conditions at 37 degrees c, but not at 25 or 42  degrees c, and produced urease, catalase, oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. the isolates did not ferment glucose, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose, amygdalin, or arabinose; hydrolyze hippurate or indoxyl acetate; or reduce nitrate. they did not produce h2s from triple sugar iron agar, and they did not grow in the presence of 1.0% glycine or 1.5% nacl. they were resistant to nalidixic acid and sensitive to cephalothin and metronidazole. cells were typically 0.3 by 2.0 microns and possessed tufts of two to five sheathed, monopolar flagella. the g+c content of strain 90-119 was 30 mol%. cluster analysis of densitometry scans of polyacrylamide protein gels revealed more than 70% similarity of the cheetah isolates to h. pylori, less than 60% similarity to helicobacter felis, and less than 50% similarity to helicobacter mustelae. complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for two of the cheetah isolates. phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the cheetah sequences to those of 19 reference strains, including h. pylori, h. felis (two strains), h. mustelae, helicobacter muridarum, "flexispira  rappini," wolinella succinogenes, campylobacter coli, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter curvus, campylobacter fetus, campylobacter hyointestinalis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter lari, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum subsp. bubulus, a campylobacter sp. (pig isolate), [bacteroides] gracilis, and [bacteroides] ureolyticus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == presence of methylated adenine in gatc sequences in chromosomal dnas from campylobacter species.
AB  == we digested chromosomal dnas from 12 campylobacter strains (c. jejuni, 4 strains; c. coli, 2 strains; c. fetus subsp. fetus, 2 strains; c. hyointestinalis, 2 strains; and c. upsaliensis, 2 strains) and from 4 helicobacter strains (h. pylori, 2 strains; and h. mustelae, 2 strains) with hindiii, ssti, bamhi, dpni, mboi, and sau3ai. restriction fragments were then separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose or 10% polyacrylamide gels. only dnas from three campylobacter species (c. jejuni, c. coli, and c. upsaliensis) were digested with dpni (an enzyme that  recognizes only methylated adenine in gatc sequences). we used mboi and sau3ai to confirm these findings.

TI  == inhibition of acid secretion from parietal cells by non-human-infecting helicobacter species: a factor in colonization of gastric mucosa?
AB  == helicobacter pylori has been shown to produce a protein that inhibits acid secretion from parietal cells. we have examined other non-human-infecting helicobacter species for this property by measuring the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine into rabbit parietal cells as an indirect assessment of acid secretion. helicobacter felis and an isolate from a rhesus monkey were shown to inhibit acid secretion. isolates of helicobacter mustelae gave variable responses. whole bacteria and cell-free sonicates impaired the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine. we also tested other bacteria, including escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, and campylobacter jejuni. as whole organisms, these control bacteria had little effect on acid secretion, but sonicates caused pronounced inhibition that was partially heat labile. pronase treatment of h. pylori destroyed its inhibitory effect. these results suggest that most helicobacter species, but not all isolates, are able to inhibit acid secretion from rabbit parietal cells. this property may be a factor in the establishment of long-term infection by these species.

TI  == isolation and biochemical and molecular analyses of a species-specific protein antigen from the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori.
AB  == a protein of mr 26,000 which was present in large quantities in extracts of cells of helicobacter pylori was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration and reversed-phase chromatography or anion-exchange chromatography. the protein appeared to be associated with the soluble fraction of the cell, and antibodies raised against the protein were reactive with whole-cell lysates of a variety of h. pylori strains in a simple immunodot blot assay. this reaction was species specific. protein sequence determination of the amino terminus and internal cyanogen bromide fragments and amino acid composition analysis were performed. an oligonucleotide derived from these data was used to clone a fragment encoding most of the coding sequence. expression in escherichia coli was dependent on vector promoters. the dna sequence of the fragment was determined. dna probes derived from the cloned fragment hybridized to genomic dna of all h. pylori strains tested, but not to dnas of helicobacter mustelae, wolinella succinogenes, various campylobacter species, and a panel of gram-negative enteric bacteria. the apparent uniqueness of this protein may be exploited for the development of species-specific diagnostics for this gastric pathogen.

TI  == evaluation of the indoxyl acetate hydrolysis test for rapid differentiation of campylobacter, helicobacter, and wolinella species.
AB  == a total of 410 well-defined campylobacter, helicobacter, and wolinella strains, comprising 26 named species, subspecies, and defined groups, were tested for indoxyl acetate hydrolysis by a disk method by using disks prepared at the centers for disease control, atlanta, ga. all c. coli (43 strains), c. cryaerophila (34 strains), c. fennelliae (5 strains), c. fennelliae-campylobacter-like organism 3 (2 strains), c. jejuni (66 strains), c.  jejuni subsp. doylei (3 strains), hippurate-negative c. jejuni-c. coli (15 strains), "c. upsaliensis" (39 strains), h. mustelae (5 strains), w. curva (1 strain), and w. recta (1 strain) hydrolyzed indoxyl acetate. four strains gave weak positive reactions, and the remaining 196 strains, which belonged to 15 species, subspecies, and defined groups, gave negative reactions. of the 410 study strains, 246 and 125 strains were tested for indoxyl acetate hydrolysis by  a disk method and a tube method, respectively, by using commercially produced disks. the disk method, regardless of source, required less time and interpretation than the tube method did. better differentiation between campylobacter spp. was obtained with the indoxyl acetate test than with the trimethylamine n-oxide test. the indoxyl acetate disk distinguished c. lari from  c. jejuni and c. coli, c. cinaedi from c. fennelliae, and h. pylori from h. mustelae and suggested that w. succinogenes could be differentiated from w. recta and w. curva. the indoxyl acetate disk method could be performed in 5 to 30 min,  was easy to read and interpret, and should be useful as a routine diagnostic test for identification of campylobacter spp.
