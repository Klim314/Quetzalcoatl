TI  == association of symptoms with gastrointestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == aim: to investigate the correlations between self-reported symptoms of irritable  bowel syndrome (ibs) and the gastrointestinal (gi) microbiota composition. methods: fecal samples were collected from a total of 44 subjects diagnosed with  ibs. their symptoms were monitored with a validated inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire adjusted for ibs patients. thirteen quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were applied to evaluate the gi microbiota composition. eubacteria and gi bacterial genera (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and veillonella), groups (clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale, desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and distinct bacterial phylotypes [closest 16s rdna  sequence resemblance to species bifidobacterium catenulatum, clostridium cocleatum, collinsella aerofaciens (c. aerofaciens), coprococcus eutactus (c. eutactus), ruminococcus torques and streptococcus bovis] with a suspected association with ibs were quantified. correlations between quantities or presence/absence data of selected bacterial groups or phylotypes and various ibs-related symptoms were investigated. results: associations were observed between subjects' self-reported symptoms and the presence or quantities of certain gi bacteria. a ruminococcus torques (r. torques)-like (94% similarity in  16s rrna gene sequence) phylotype was associated with severity of bowel symptoms. furthermore, among ibs subjects with r. torques 94% detected, the amounts of c. cocleatum 88%, c. aerofaciens-like and c. eutactus 97% phylotypes were significantly reduced. interesting observations were also made concerning the effect of a subject's weight on gi microbiota with regard to c. aerofaciens-like  phylotype, bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. conclusion: bacteria seemingly affecting the symptom scores are unlikely to be the underlying cause or cure of ibs, but they may serve as biomarkers of the condition.
