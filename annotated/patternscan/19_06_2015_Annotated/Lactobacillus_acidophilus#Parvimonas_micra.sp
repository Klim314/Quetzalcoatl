TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == methods for optimizing dna extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time pcr.
AB  == methods for the optimal extraction of genomic dna for real-time pcr enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and fusobacterium nucleatum. traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of dna content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time pcr approach. evidence was obtained that p. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded dna from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. this nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mm diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol  at 4 degrees c overnight. a final purification of the dna to remove any potential pcr inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of dna by real-time pcr and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.
