TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with normal  and altered glycated hemoglobin levels in two regions in brazil.
AB  == purpose: to study the aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with regard to the management of diabetes, assessed using glycated hemoglobin levels. methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted using conjunctival smears of diabetic patients from both sexes and with different ages, residing in two different brazilian cities (sorocaba and rio branco). a control group of non-diabetic patients was also included. the diabetic patients were considered to have controlled diabetes when their glycated hemoglobin level was </=7% and blood glucose level was </=126 mg/dl. patients with non-controlled diabetes were those with glycated hemoglobin levels >7% and blood glucose levels  >126 mg/dl. the samples obtained were inoculated in brain-heart infusion broth and in culture media for aerobic bacteria (blood and chocolate agars); bacterial  growth was evaluated in a microbiology laboratory. results: a total of 120 eyes of 120 patients were included in the present study. the percentage of cultures in which bacterial growth was observed was greater in diabetic patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.103). there was a greater trend toward bacterial growth in the conjunctiva of diabetic patients with altered fasting blood glucose. there was no difference in the frequency of bacterial growth on the conjunctiva between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. in sorocaba, conjunctival bacterial growth was similar to that observed in rio branco. the microorganism most frequently detected in the present study was staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. conclusion: there was no difference between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. the microorganisms found were similar to those found in studies investigating the conjunctival bacterial flora of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

TI  == preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  == the ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. a recombinantly produced cdh from myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mm or 2 mm cellobiose as substrate. biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by cdh when supplemented with 1mm cellobiose. the cdh/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. interestingly, cdh was also able to produce h(2)o(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exps) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. the h(2)o(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exps were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for cdh as well as destabilises the biofilm. furthermore, cdh suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. incorporation of the cdh/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore  makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.

TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == the influence of urinary ph on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the effects of ph on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including ph. because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (ph 4.5) to alkaline (ph 8) conditions and can be  easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of ph in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. materials and  methods: this in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) over the  range of ph 5-8. standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. one-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (p <.05). results: for 18 of the 24 agents, ph was shown to play a significant role  in overall inhibitory activity. although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed ph-dependent effects  against certain organisms. the fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline ph, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by ph. conclusion: clinicians should consider the urinary ph of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. future clinical investigations examining urinary ph and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe): a new antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant cyclic dipeptide from bacillus sp. n strain associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode.
AB  == a new microbial cyclic dipeptide (diketopiperazine), cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) was isolated for the first time from the ethyl acetate extract of fermented modified  nutrient broth of bacillus sp. n strain associated with rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode. antibacterial activity of the compound was determined  by minimum inhibitory concentration and agar disc diffusion method against medically important bacteria and the compound recorded significant antibacterial  against test bacteria. highest activity was recorded against staphylococcus epidermis (1 microg/ml) followed by proteus mirabilis (2 microg/ml). the activity of cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) against s. epidermis is better than chloramphenicol, the standard antibiotics. cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) recorded significant antitumor activity  against a549 cells (ic50 value: 10 mum) and this compound recorded no cytotoxicity against factor signaling normal fibroblast cells up to 100 mum. cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) induced significant morphological changes and dna fragmentation associated with apoptosis in a549 cells. acridine orange/ethidium bromide stained cells indicated apoptosis induction by cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe). flow cytometry analysis showed that the cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) did not induce cell cycle arrest. effector molecule of apoptosis such as caspase-3 was found activated in treated cells, suggesting apoptosis as the main mode of cell death. antioxidant activity was evaluated by free radical scavenging and reducing power activity, and the compound recorded significant antioxidant activity. the free radical scavenging activity of cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) is almost equal to that of butylated hydroxyanisole, the standard antioxidant agent. we also compared the biological activity of natural cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) with synthetic cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) and cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe). natural and synthetic cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) recorded similar pattern of activity. although synthetic cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe) recorded lower activity. but in the case of reducing power activity, synthetic cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe) recorded significant activity than natural and synthetic cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe). the results of the present study reveals that cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) is more bioactive than cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe). to the best of our  knowledge, this is the first time that cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) has been isolated from  microbial natural source and also the antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant  activity of cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) is also reported for the first time.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == antiadhesive activity of the biosurfactant pseudofactin ii secreted by the arctic bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens bd5.
AB  == background: pseudofactin ii is a recently identified biosurfactant secreted by pseudomonas fluorescens bd5, the strain obtained from freshwater from the arctic  archipelago of svalbard. pseudofactin ii is a novel compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth  amino acid in peptide moiety. the c-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of thr3. adhesion is the first stage of biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e.g. glass, polystyrene, silicone modifies its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. in this study the role and applications of pseudofactin ii as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives. results: pseudofactin ii lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis and two candida albicans strains. pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin ii inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36-90% and that of c. albicans by 92-99%. the same concentration of pseudofactin ii dislodged 26-70% of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. pseudofactin ii also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of e. faecalis, e. coli, e. hirae and c. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. the highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of s. epidermidis, partial (18-37%) inhibition of other bacteria and 8-9% inhibition of c. albicans growth. conclusion: pseudofactin ii showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. up to 99% prevention could be achieved by 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin ii. in addition, pseudofactin ii dispersed preformed biofilms. pseudofactin ii can be used as a disinfectant or surface coating agent against microbial colonization of different surfaces, e.g. implants or urethral catheters.

TI  == [the analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to fess method].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == n,n-dichlorotaurine: chemical and bactericidal properties.
AB  == the biogenous antimicrobial agent n-chlorotaurine (nct) converts by disproportionation to n,n-dichlorotaurine (ndct) at a rate proportional to acidity. this occurs at appreciable amounts already in weakly acidic biological systems. to understand the consequences of ndct formation, a thorough investigation of this undescribed compound was mandatory, which needed its synthesis. differently from nct, this was possible in the aqueous system using trichloroisocyanuric acid. while the free acid, cl(2)hnch(2)ch(2)so(3)h, was not  available in pure form, its sodium and potassium salts were analytically pure and showed melting points (decomposition) of 125-128 degrees c (potassium) and 162-164 degrees c (sodium). the sodium salt demonstrated unexpected long-term stability even at room temperature (8.4 % loss of activity within 4 months). the  aqueous solutions of both salts exhibited a weak acid reaction, and they were less stable than nct. with regard to chlorination of amines (transhalogenation),  ndct was, surprisingly, less efficacious than nct, which manifested itself by a lack of reactivity at ph < 7, for which a mechanistic explanation is given. compared on a molar scale, ndct was more bactericidal than nct against the gram-negative bacteria e. coli, p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis, while there was no difference concerning the gram-positive ones, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. the increase of bactericidal activity at acidic ph was the same as observed with  nct and is attributed to a higher susceptibility of bacteria in this environment. taken together, ndct seems not to be suited to substitute nct as a preparation fit for medical practice.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  == the reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. new derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such  as, o-glycidylketoxime (4) and o-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted n-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. the syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. all of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis atcc 14153 and candida albicans atcc 10231. among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-o-[2-hydroxy-3-(n-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against s. aureus atcc 6538. the compounds 2, 5b, 6b,  6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-o-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. none of the other compounds  exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.

TI  == bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  == blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in akwa ibom state and analyzed for the presence of salmonella species and other bacteria. of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. female subjects were more infected than males. the commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, salmonella paratyphi and salmonella typhi. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, k. aerogenes, s. faecalis, proteus mirabilis and p. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were s. aureus, e. coli, s. typhi, s. paratyphi, shigella sp, k. pneumoniae, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and vibrio cholerae 01. the isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. these antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. the results suggest the existence  of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. this is worrisome, since some of the s. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == enhanced biofilm-production in pathogens isolated from patients with rare metabolic disorders.
AB  == biofilm-producing bacteria were isolated from the urine of 19 patients with very  rare metabolic disorders including: hyperlactacidaemia (8 cases), sugar intolerance and gammopathy (1 case), cystinuria (2 cases), parkinson's disease (1 case), lipidaemia (2 cases), hyperaminoaciduria (1 case) and others (4 cases). a  total of 34 strains were collected, gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms were equally distributed among the slime-producing bacteria, with  a prevalence of staphylococcus epidermidis (30%) the most frequent microorganism  isolated together with escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis that accounted for  15% of this group of strains. a quantitative assay of the biofilm production revealed that in gram-positive pathogens it was three times greater than that observed in bacteria collected from patients not affected by metabolic diseases (p = 0.0001). in gram-negative strains the biofilm synthesis was 2.2 times higher than those detected in the same bacteria isolated in the absence of metabolic disorders (p = 0.0033). the results observed indicate that biofilm production is  enhanced in bacteria isolated from the urine of patients with metabolic disorders. it is suggested that unusual metabolites might facilitate pathogen production of biofilm found in the urine of these patients.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan was evaluated yearly for two years from june  2000 to march 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and flomoxef (fmox). in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002. in these surveillances spanning two years, the mic90s of cmz against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (mssa, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 73%-->87%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (other cns, 13%-->18%), escherichia coli (4%-->1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), morganella morganii (7%-->0%), providencia spp. (17%-->0%),  peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, s. epidermidis, other cns, and other bacteroides spp. tended to increase. in addition, the percent resistance of b. fragilis was 10%. it is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and superior to that of sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the  tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that  of fmox. against b. fragilis and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was  almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of  sbt/cpz and fmox. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before cmz was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity.

TI  == different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  == we examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (egcg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods. compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of egcg against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, and s. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher mics (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against gram-negative rods, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. and difference was observed between the binding abilities of egcg with viable s. aureus and with e. coli. the bactericidal activity of egcg for s. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide  or dextran. it was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of egcg. these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different  affinities of egcg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the  different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to egcg.

TI  == temporomandibular joint involvement in malignant external otitis.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to present 6 patients with malignant external otitis (meo) that resulted in temporomandibular joint (tmj) involvement  and to discuss the incidence, clinical presentation, and treatment modalities. study design: all patients diagnosed with meo between 1994 and 2002 were reviewed for cases in which the tmj was invaded by the infectious process. only patients in whom tmj involvement was documented radiographically and in whom the clinical  course was well documented were included in this study. results: meo was diagnosed in 42 patients over an 8-year period; tmj involvement was recorded in 6 patients (14%). the medical history revealed controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus  in 4 of the 6 patients. all patients reported early ear symptoms, mainly otalgia  and otorrhea. local signs included an ear canal filled with granulation material, edematous overlying skin, and sensitivity to palpation. cultures taken from the external ear were positive for either pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, aspergillus, or proteus mirabilis. tmj symptoms developed between 1  and 5 months after admission and included painful periauricular swelling and trismus. in 3 patients, healing was uneventful; 3 also died of the disease. conclusions: tmj involvement in meo is associated with a resistant disease process, often with several recurrences. prolonged administration of antibiotics  is the treatment of choice. surgical debridement of the tmj is necessary for the  positive identification of the pathogenic organism, in cases of abscess formation, or when osteomyelitic bone destruction of the condyle and glenoid fossa develop.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == bioactivity of secoiridoid glycosides from centaurium erythraea.
AB  == as part of our on-going search for bioactive compounds from scottish plants, two  secoiridoid glycosides, swertiamarin and sweroside, have been isolated from the aerial parts of centaurium erythraea rafn (family: gentianaceae) by reversed-phase preparative hplc coupled with a photo-diode-array detector. the structures of these compounds were elucidated unambiguously by uv, fabms and extensive 1d and 2d nmr spectroscopic analyses and also by comparing experimental data with literature data. antibacterial, free radical scavenging activities and  general toxicity of these glycosides have been assessed. both compounds inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli. while swertiamarin was also active against proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens, sweroside inhibited the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis. swertiamarin and sweroside exhibited significant general toxicity in brine shrimp lethality bioassay and the ld50 values were 8.0 microg/ml and 34 microg/ml, respectively, whereas that of the positive control podophyllotoxin, a  well known cytotoxic lignan, was 2.79 microg/ml. chemotaxonomic implications of these compounds in the family gentianaceae have also been discussed briefly.

TI  == comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). time killing curves against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae  were performed. serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. in the urine series,  levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs cfu/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on e. coli (both), p. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and p. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). in the bronchial mucosa series,  s. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and k. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. in conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.

TI  == [long-term cefadroxil prophylaxis in children with recurrent urinary tract infections].
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose, long-term cefadroxil prophylaxis in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in children. a prospective, randomized trial in 33 children (32 female, 1 male) aged 2-14 years (mean 8.1+/-2.8) was conducted. children with recurrent urinary tract infections were commenced to six-month prophylaxis with cefadroxil at the dosage of 12.5-15.0 mg/kg at bedtime administered every night (group i, n=15) or  alternate night (group ii, n=18). escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (90.9%), followed by proteus mirabilis (3.0%) and klebsiella oxytoca (3.0%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (3.0%). cefadroxil prophylaxis was  effective in 80% of patients in group i and in 78% patients in group ii. reinfection occurred in 3/15 (20%) patients in-group i and in 4/18 (22.2%) patients in-group ii (odds ratio--1.14; 95% confidence interval--0.16-8.3). the difference of reinfection rate between the groups was not significant (p=0.88). the rate of day- and night-time wetting in both groups before prophylaxis of urinary tract infections was high. it decreased significantly at the end of prophylactic treatment with cefadroxil (from 42.4% to 9.1% and from 39.4% to 6.1% respectively). mild adverse reaction (nausea) was observed in 1/33 patient. in conclusion our study shows that cefadroxil is an effective, well-tolerated and safe agent in the urinary tract infections prophylaxis. prophylaxis of recurrent  urinary tract infections in children with cefadroxil on alternate night regimen might reduce the cost of the treatment.

TI  == serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
AB  == background: controversy exists regarding the appropriate prophylactic dose of cefazolin for coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) because the effect of cpb on serum drug levels is poorly understood. current standards of prophylaxis are based primarily on empiric studies. few studies have attempted to quantify serum cefazolin levels in either cardiac or noncardiac surgeries. this study was conducted to measure and assess the adequacy of the intraoperative serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin  in cpb surgery. methods: this prospective study serially measured six intraoperative serum cefazolin levels in 10 subjects undergoing elective and urgent cabg surgery. we compared the serum levels with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90) for the most common organisms causing postoperative infection. results: serum-free cefazolin levels fluctuated considerably during the operation but remained above the mic90, for staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. the serum levels fell below the mic90 for enterobacter, serratia, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis. conclusions: serum cefazolin levels during cpb remained consistently above the mic for two of the three main organisms causing postoperative infection but were suboptimal for the remainder.  additional studies are needed to assess the intraoperative serum levels of single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis and to explore alternate dosing methods that minimize intraoperative fluctuations in serum cefazolin levels.

TI  == is there a need for postoperative surveillance after day case groin surgery in children?
AB  == there is increasing awareness of the value of day case paediatric surgery in fulfilling the needs of the community. is this cost effective, are there hidden complications and is there a need for routine follow-up? seven hundred and thirty-one children attending the red cross war memorial children's hospital day  surgery unit over a 32-month period, and undergoing 912 procedures confined to the inguinoscrotal region, were enrolled in the study. surgical procedures performed included inguinal herniotomy, orchidopexy and circumcision. of the 731  children, 159 consecutive children had their inguinal and perineal skin flora analysed preoperatively and in 59 of these children three skin swabs were taken from the groin area: before routine skin preparation for surgery, after the skin  preparation and on completion of the operation. staphylococcus epidermidis predominated as the normal skin flora (70%), followed by escherichia coli (19%) and proteus mirabilis (10%), while s. aureus was only found in 2.5% of cases. the efficacy of cleaning with 4% chlorhexidine and 2% povidone-iodine in 70% alcohol  is shown by virtual complete eradication of the organisms isolated from the preoperative skin cultures. in only 2 cases (3.4%) were organisms (s. aureus and  s. epidermidis respectively) isolated following skin preparation. cultures taken  at the end of operative procedures grew predominantly s. epidermidis (5 cases, 8.5%). children were discharged from the day unit once they had taken fluids and  had passed urine. the wounds were also checked for any evidence of bleeding. follow-up was done 2 weeks later by means of a visit to the day unit where the same surgeon assessed wound healing according to the southampton wound assessment scale. ninety-four per cent of the wounds had healed by primary intention; 4.5% had minor complications and 1.5% had septic complications. our trial confirms that wound sepsis is an infrequent but significant complication of day case groin surgery. routine follow-up by surgical day units of minor surgical cases is not warranted and will incur unnecessary cost. only 1.5% of postoperative cases will  require further medical attention and septic lesions in the lymphatic drainage area should be regarded as risk factors.

AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to  human subjects. methods: thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. the indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole  (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results: all the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by hplc. the level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. a mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. the level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. conclusion: the vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the mic(90) against proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterobacter spp.

TI  == chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of lantana  xenica.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria  micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.

TI  == assessment of peo/ptmo multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane blends as coating materials for urinary catheters: in vitro bacterial adhesion and encrustation behavior.
AB  == the effective long-term use of indwelling urinary catheters has often been hindered by catheter-associated infection and encrustation. in this study, the suitability of poly(ethylene oxide) (peo)-based multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane (spu) blends as coating materials for the commercial urinary catheters was assessed by measuring swellability, bacterial adhesion, and encrustation behavior. when exposed to pbs (ph 7.4), the blends absorbed a significant amount of water, which was proportional to the copolymer content. it  was demonstrated from bacterial adhesion tests that compared to bare spu, the blend surfaces could significantly reduce the adhesion of e. coli, p. mirabilis,  and s. epidermidis; the number of adherent bacteria correlated with the amount of copolymer additive. indicating that the swellability of the blends affected bacterial adhesion. of the bacteria studied, the greatest effect of the copolymer additive was observed in s. epidermidis adhesion, in which there was an 85% decrease compared to bare spu with a small amount of copolymer additive as low as 5% based on a dried blend. by using an artificial bladder model, allowing the catheter to be blocked by encrustation, it was revealed that the blend surfaces could effectively resist encrustation. the duration of patency was extended up to 20 +/- 3.1 h on the blend surface containing 10% of the copolymer additive, whereas the silicone-coated catheter, a control, required the least time for blockage, 7.8 +/- 3.1 h. the superior characteristics of the blends compared to other surfaces might be attributed to their peo-rich surfaces, produced by the migration of peo phase in the copolymer chain of the blends in an aqueous environment, and provide promising potential as a coating material on the urinary catheter for long-term catheterization.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == [can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant  bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). a microbiological diagnosis can be made  by examination of a urine sample, and in danish family practice the diagnosis of  uti is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. these methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. the aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria  by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. material and methods: urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent  to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. no prior instruction in testing procedure was given. as the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the department of microbiology, university of southern denmark, were used. results: significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. the corresponding figures for urine  culture were 95% and 96%. the morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified  correctly in terms of their motility. discussion: the results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

TI  == comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  == gemifloxacin (sb-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis) and gram-positive wound infection resulting from streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis or staphylococcus aureus. gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin,  grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. in the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (p < 0.01) compared with no treatment. no comparator agent  had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (p < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against e. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were  inferior (p < 0.01) against p. mirabilis infection. in the s. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (p <  0.01). results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (p > 0.05). gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (p < 0.01). no comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against s. pyogenes or s. aureus infections. these data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of  gram-negative urinary tract infection and gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == the facilitating effect of cigarette smoke on the colonization of instilled bacteria into the tracheal lumen in rats and the improving influence of supplementary vitamin e on this process.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate the direct influence of cigarette smoke on the bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract and the effect of supplementary vitamin e on the colonization of instilled bacteria into the trachea of rats that do not have the chronic airway pathology associated with smoking. methodology: thirty male wistar albino rats, weighing approximately 250 g, were used as experimental animals. a 0.1 ml bacterial suspension containing six bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenza, peptostreptococci spp.), isolated previously from pharynx  of rats, were instilled into the trachea of three groups of rat (10 control, 10 cigarette smoke-treated and 10 cigarette smoke- and vitamin e-supplemented rats). the smoke-treated rats were exposed to cigarette smoke for 3 days prior to and after intratracheal instillation. the third group of rats were given vitamin e supplements (100 mg/kg per day). tracheobronchial lavage samples of all rats were quantitatively cultured after 3 days from the instillation. results: the colony numbers of isolated bacteria were significantly higher in cigarette smoke-treated rats than in the control group and in the smoke- and vitamin e-supplemented rats  (p < 0.05). only s. aureus and s. epidermidis were isolated from vitamin e-supplemented rats, while instilled all six bacterial species were isolated from the other two groups. conclusions: it is concluded that smoking impairs the elimination of bacteria or facilitates colonization of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of rats. supplementary treatment with vitamin e reduces the effect of cigarette smoke; however, some bacteria may be resistant to this action of vitamin e.

TI  == in vitro viability of external eye microbial flora in hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose.
AB  == the aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (hpmc) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of  the external eye. pure reference strain cultures of candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. serial twofold dilutions of 2% hpmc, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution  (0.85% nacl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. one hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. after 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. after 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. c. albicans and p. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. p. acnes and p. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. s. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. s. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. the viability of p. aeruginosa in hpmc dilutions needs  to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of hpmc may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.

TI  == macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris.
AB  == a cdna encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant african snail achacina fulica ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rach) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kda. carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rach was composed  of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol n-acetylglucosamine residues. antimicrobial activity  using escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus showed that the rach had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. the rach showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rach inhibited the growth of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis in addition to e. coli and s. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus. the rach was also effective in preventing growth of vibrio anguillarum and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the results suggested that the rach had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  == background: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. methods: cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. in application mode i, patients received on the day  before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. in application mode ii, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees c. the hplc method was used for measuring the concentration. results: the highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. in this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). these mean concentration are all above the mic90 of gram-negative bacteria like proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. in some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. conclusions: the mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the mic90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == activities of ll-37, a cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptide of human neutrophils.
AB  == human neutrophils contain two structurally distinct types of antimicrobial peptides, beta-sheet defensins (hnp-1 to hnp-4) and the alpha-helical peptide ll-37. we used radial diffusion assays and an improved national committee for clinical laboratory standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of ll-37, hnp-1, and protegrin (pg-1). although generally less potent than pg-1, ll-37 showed considerable activity (mic, <10 microgram/ml) against pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mm nacl. certain organisms (methicillin-resistant s. aureus, proteus mirabilis, and candida albicans) were resistant to ll-37 in media that contained 100 mm nacl but were susceptible in low-salt media. burkholderia cepacia was resistant to ll-37,  pg-1, and hnp-1 in low- or high-salt media. ll-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of e. coli ml-35p. chromogenic limulus assays revealed that ll-37 bound to e. coli o111:b4 lipopolysaccharide (lps) with a high affinity and  that this binding showed positive cooperativity (hill coefficient = 2.02). circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that ll-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid a, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. the broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of ll-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hcap-18) may protect skin and other tissues  from bacterial intrusions and lps-induced toxicity. the potent activity of ll-37  against p. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis.

TI  == an infection inhibiting urinary catheter material.
AB  == catheter associated bacteriuria is a common infection in hospitals and nursing homes. an infection inhibiting catheter material for fabricating urinary catheters is being developed. the material consists of silicone rubber elastomer  compounded with chlorhexidene gluconate (chg) matrix. the antibiotic is released  in sustained fashion over at least 4 weeks. a method was established for adding chg to silicone rubber. to protect the chg, it is suspended in a water soluble wax that also modulates chg release from the elastomer. it was found that chg is  randomly dispersed in the elastomer and that the primary release mechanism is by  diffusion. the antibacterial activity of the material with a range of 0.1 to 5% chg by weight was examined using in vitro zone inhibition testing. the new material demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against three pathogens tested (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus epidermidis.). the release rate of chg was measured in vitro using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). with 5% chg loading, the antibiotic was released at a steady rate of approximately 8.4 mg/cm2/day for periods extending beyond 4 weeks. this new material for urinary catheters has the potential to provide protection against infection and surface colonization.

TI  == cerebrospinal fluid broth culture isolates: their significance for antibiotic treatment.
AB  == enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (csf). to assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151  consecutive csf bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. treatment decisions associated with individual csf specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with csf specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial  therapy based on the reporting of csf culture isolates. thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from  34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (candida tropicalis, proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second csf specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. thus, only a single isolate (3%; staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. in contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; cryptococcus neoformans, 10; streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). we conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from csf specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of csf broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during the period of june 1995 to may 1996. of  the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) showed the highest activities against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. vancomycin (vcm) and piperacillin (pipc) were also active with the  mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm showed the highest activities against s. aureus isolated from  patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml against both s. aureus and mrsa. arbekacin (abk) was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. the other except minocycline (mino) had very low activities with the mic90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis abk and mino showed the strongest activities against s. epidermidis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. vcm was also active with the mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. the mic90s of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml  in 1995. these results indicated that some resistances existed among s. epidermidis to cephems. 4. streptococcus agalactiae all drugs except gentamicin (gm) were active against s. agalactiae. abpc, cefmenoxime (cmx), ipm, erythromycin (em), clindamycin (cldm) and clarithromycin (cam) showed the highest activities. the mics for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. the mic90s of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. citrobacter freundii ipm showed the highest activity against c. freundii isolated from patients utis. its  mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. gm was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop) and amikacin (amk) were also active with the mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cmx, cpr and czop showed low activities with mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. enterobacter  cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. mino and tosufloxacin (tflx)  were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cpr and czop showed lower activities with the mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml  or above. 7. escherichia coli. most of the antimicrobial agents were active against e. coli. particularly cpr, czop and ipm showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. cmx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. penicillins were slightly active with mic90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml or below. carumonam (crmn) had the strongest activity against k. pneumoniae, the mics for all strains were equal to  or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of k. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. for example, the mic90s of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. proteus mirabilis p. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. cmx, ceftazidime (caz), cefixime (cfix), and crmn showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis isolated from patients with utis. mics of crmn for all

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. methods: two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different  administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. at  the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees c. antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. the  highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours  and 0800 hours, prior to operation. when applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). these mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. conclusion: of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. this fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial  management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against streptococcus pneumoniae or pseudomanas aeruginosa.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and fk037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  == fresh clinical isolates collected from november 1, 1992 through november 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including  fk037 and l-ofloxacin. among the 10 040 organisms tested were staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, n = 455), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), escherichia coli (n = 2326), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), proteus mirabilis (n = 445), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). both l-ofloxacin and fk037 inhibited 98% of s. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. fk037 was at least 4 times  more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against mrsa, inhibiting  79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. while the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.

TI  == variations in the fluorescence intensity of intact dapi-stained bacteria and their implications for rapid bacterial quantification.
AB  == as current techniques for the quantification of bacteria are laborious and often  imprecise, instrumental approaches such as sedimentation field-flow fractionation (sdfff) are attractive. in this technique, fluorogenic dyes specific for nucleic  acids are used to identify bacterial cells. bacterial biomass can be quantified directly with sdfff if the specific fluorescence of bacterial cells is constant.  the effect of different growth conditions on the specific fluorescence of one strain each of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus epidermidis stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was examined. specific fluorescence varied over a 500-fold range, from 0.22 to 103 arbitrary fluorescence units per cell. specific fluorescence was highest when cells were in log phase, and lowest when cells were in stationary phase. specific fluorescence decreased when cells harvested in log phase were starved for 7 d in  a carbon-free minimal medium, and increased rapidly (within 2 h) after cells were relieved from carbon limitation. such variations in specific fluorescence must be considered when using gross fluorescence as a direct indicator of bacterial numbers in the sdfff technique for quantifying bacterial biomass. moreover, they  have serious implications for the application of fluorescence techniques in other instrumental approaches for bacterial enumeration in environmental samples.

TI  == endophthalmitis in patients with retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification.
AB  == purpose: to review the treatment and outcomes of patients presenting with concurrent endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. methods: a retrospective chart review was conducted on patients presenting with culture-proven endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification between 1990 and 1994. results: five patients were identified with culture-proven endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. in all patients, coagulase-negative staphylococci were cultured from the vitreous fluid. one patient also had positive cultures for proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. the interval between cataract surgery and treatment ranged from 5 days to 6 months. echography was beneficial in showing retained lens fragments in five of five patients when media opacities obscured the view of the fundus. four patients had vitrectomy and removal of retained lens fragments during their initial treatment. the fifth patient was treated with intravitreal antibiotics alone and continued to have marked inflammation, eventually requiring vitrectomy for removal of the retained lens fragments. a final visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in four of the five patients. conclusions: patients may present with endophthalmitis in the setting of retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. in such cases, the preferred initial management may be pars plana vitrectomy, removal of retained lens fragments, and injection of intraocular antibiotics. in eyes with endophthalmitis and opaque media, echography is a useful screening modality.

TI  == evidence that orthotopic transposition following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation corrects overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == an overgrowth of pathogenic organisms occurs following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation. this study assessed whether the bacterial microflora return to normal following subsequent orthotopic transposition of the graft. after 14 days the heterotopic graft was placed into continuity following resection of 15 cm of the host midintestinal loop. quantitative and qualitative analyses of the intraluminal bacteria were performed studying the resected host intestine, the heterotopic graft at 14 days, and the graft 14 days after transposition. a group of normal rats were used as controls. an overgrowth of staphylococcus epidermidis evident in the heterotopic graft at 14 days returned to a more normal bacterial profile following orthotopic transposition. these findings suggest that early interposition of a small bowel graft into an orthotopic position may prevent an alteration in the small bowel ecology toward potentially pathogenic organisms capable of translocation.

TI  == development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  == wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. forty of 63 (64%)  infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis  (29%), enterococcus faecalis (17%), staphylococcus aureus (17%), escherichia coli (11%) and proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. only 7 of 42 (17%)  noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only s aureus, s epidermidis and corynebacterium species isolated. ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a  statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.

AB  == many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. it has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary ph, with consequent stone formation. unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g.  escherichia coli). it has been recently reported that e. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. this study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and micrococcus luteus. subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (p < 0.003) reduce the uk activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. the urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, m. luteus, was, however,  the exception (p = 0.1079). in contrast to s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and m. luteus (p < 0.0213), p. mirabilis and s. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase  activity (p < 0.4047). these results may explain why proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. according to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. these conditions may lead to renal stone formation. an increase in urinary ph resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. it is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double  role in renal stone formation.

TI  == [experimental study on the role of bacteria from urinary tract infections on the  bladder carcinogenesis].
AB  == the role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (uti) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological  factor in the development of bladder cancer. the bacterial strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with uti at the kyushu university hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mm) in a growth medium (ph 7.2) at 37 degrees c. of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microm no2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of e. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microm) could be detected. various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. the effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. the mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees c was assayed by the ames salmonella/microsome test (using ta100 or ta98 with s9-mix). the mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing s. marcescens or  p. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an xad-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mm) at ph 3 for 4 hrs. the potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. the mutagen formation at an optimal ph 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. it was noted that even at a physiological ph 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. the mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mm) at ph 6. mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. the levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach to evaluate administration dose of arbekacin. reevaluation of in vitro mic break points in the disk susceptibility test].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (abk) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the abk disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. in addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of abk. the 4 category system used in japan, and  the system proposed by the japanese society for antimicrobial chemotherapy were studied. in this study, mics were determined using the mueller-hinton agar containing 50 mg/l of ca and 25 mg/l of mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml.  mic90 values of abk against staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. those against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris,  enterobacter spp., and citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. mic90 values against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. the disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the showa disk manual. the inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with mics. results of abk disk susceptibility test with 30,  10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of mics (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, p < 0.01). in the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in mic values of abk proposed are (+ + +) mic < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) mic > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) mic > 50 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. with 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. in the break point classification system of japanese society for antimicrobial chemotherapy, the mic break point for abk proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. it appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with mic values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. a pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for abk (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of abk reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bark extracts of bridelia ferruginea (euphorbiaceae).
AB  == water and ethanol extracts of bridelia ferruginea were examined for phytochemical and antimicrobial properties. the extracts, which were tested at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, produced in vitro antimicrobial activities in assays against hospital strains of staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, streptococcus lactis, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes and klebsiella sp. the zones  of inhibition produced by the extracts in agar diffusion assays against the test  micro-organisms ranged from 4 to 20 mm, while the chloramphenicol antibiotic control produced zones that measured 15-36 mm. preliminary phytochemical analysis of the plant extracts showed the presence of phenols and tannins. sesquiterpenes, anthroquinones, and saponins were not detected in the extracts. the gram-negative bacteria appeared to be more susceptible (4-20 mm) to the antimicrobial effect of the extracts than the gram-positive organisms (4-18 mm).

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of a siderophore. 3. the activity of deferoxamine in vitro and its influence on the effect of antibiotics against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == the in vitro activity of deferoxamine (dfo) both per se and in combination with the reductant ascorbic acid (aa) was determined against 10 e. coli strains, 5 p.  mirabilis strains, and 10 coagulase-negative staphylococci. in terms of interaction, the influence of dfo on the activities of cephalothin and gentamicin was furthermore investigated against the same panel of strains employing a macrobroth dilution technique and killing-curve kinetics. the mics of cephalothin and gentamicin were lowered for one half of the strains. moreover, dfo prolonged  the generation times of logarithmic growth phase considerably, especially when the reductant aa was present. the interactions between dfo or dfo+aa and subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were established by the application of growth constants, and resulted in synergy for 15 out of 25 strains with cephalothin and 9 out of 25 strains with gentamicin.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == the effects of electric current on bacteria colonising intravenous catheters.
AB  == the effect of a direct electric current (10 microa) on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis was investigated. when the ends of negatively-charged intravascular catheters were placed in nutrient agar seeded with bacteria, circular zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed around the catheters. the zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organism under test. zones of inhibition were not produced around positively-charged catheters. bacteria colonising the surfaces of catheters were  similarly affected by the application of a 10 microa electric current. a negative electric current applied to colonised catheters for 4 to 24 h significantly reduced the number of adherent viable organisms as compared to controls. the results demonstrated that a constant electric current of low amperage might be used to reduce bacterial colonisation of intravascular catheters. this may offer  a novel means of protecting catheters and other prosthetic devices from associated sepsis in vivo.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase enzyme production in bacteria isolated from women with postpartum endometritis.
AB  == one hundred eighty-four postpartum patients with the diagnosis of endomyometritis underwent intrauterine culturing. beta-lactamase production was tested using nitrocephin-impregnated discs in 278 bacterial isolates from patients with postpartum endometritis. beta-lactamase production was found to be present in 149 of 278 (54%) isolates tested: 0 of 39 streptococcus faecalis (0%), 22 of 41 escherichia coli (54%), 66 of 68 bacteroides bivius (97%), 0 of 13 proteus mirabilis (0%) and 15 of 42 staphylococcus epidermidis (36%). anaerobes, as a group, had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production, 94 of 102 (93%), followed by gram negatives, 34 of 84 (40%), then gram positives, 21 of 91 (23%).  however, it was the beta-lactamase produced by the gram-negative bacteria that was most responsive to the addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor. the frequent isolation of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from patients with postpartum endometritis raises concern about the use of antibiotics not resistant to these enzymes. therefore, antibiotics combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor may have potential as single-agent therapy in obstetric and gynecologic infections.

TI  == continuing the search for bacterial urovirulence factors.
AB  == bacteria that commonly cause infections of the normal urinary tract (eg escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus) do so because they possess specific urovirulence factors. adhesions of various types (often fimbriae) seem to be the most important of these. in e. coli several other factors have been recognized, and sub-sets of defined uropathogenic clones exist. on the other hand, urovirulence determinants are less easy to distinguish in species such as s. epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae, that rarely cause such  infections, or are pathogenic only in the presence of some abnormality or deficiency in host defences.

TI  == quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in er(iii) solution by thin-film magnetopheresis.
AB  == magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, er, was evaluated. the magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. the optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mm nacl and 5 mm ercl(3) solution. three gram-positive bacteria,  staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. qualitative analysis consisted of gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. the  magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of e. coli down to the concentration of 10 cfu ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. on average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms  was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. the thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.

AB  == thirty ureteral stents, inserted for 5 to 128 days following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, were examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms. of these, 90% had adherent pathogens (44% mixed organisms) on the stents, 45% of which were present in low numbers (10(1)-10(2) per 1 cm3 section) and 55% were in small and  large microcolony biofilms (> 2 x 10(2)-10(7)). the organisms were recovered from the stents even though urine culture was only positive in 27% of patients. of the organisms isolated, 77% were gram positive cocci, 15% gram negative rods and 8% candida. no blockage of the stents occurred. all of the patients had received antimicrobial therapy post-insertion, and in 15 cases biofilms were found while on treatment. none of the patients received therapy for urinary tract infections  while the stent remained in place. in vitro experiments demonstrated the ability  of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis uropathogens to adhere and form biofilms on ureteral stents within 24 hours. clearly, bacterial biofilms do occur on ureteral stents and urinary culture may not detect their presence. the high recovery rate of gram positive organisms may indicate a preferential adhesion to the biomaterial surface. the findings also indicate that unlike biofilm formation on many other prosthetic implants, colonization with gram positive organisms on ureteral stents does not necessarily coincide with the development symptomatic infection.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of amikacin (amk) against 269 strains of various clinical isolates obtained in 1989 were determined and the reliability of the amk disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. in addition, clinical significance of various systems for the interpretation of the  disc tests was evaluated to determine more useful method in the evaluation of clinical efficacy of amk. included in the study were a 3 category system of nccls, a 4 category system used in japan, and the system proposed by the british  society for antimicrobial chemotherapy. in this study, mics were determined using the mueller-hinton agar containing 50 mg/l of ca and 25 mg/l of mg at an inoculum level of 10(3-4) cfu/ml. mic80 values of amk against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. those against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, enterobactor aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. were less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. mic values against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens  were both less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml. the disc susceptibility test  was carried out according to the instruction in the showa disc manual. inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with mic values. the results of amk disc susceptibility test obtained either with 30 micrograms discs or 10 micrograms discs were well correlated with mics, indicating that the disc method  was reliable in estimating approximate values of mics (r = -0.807 to -0.897, p less than 0.01 in both instances). in the 4 category classification system currently used in japan, the break points in mic values of amk proposed are (+3)  mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (+2) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, and (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with showa 30 micrograms discs and 30 micrograms discs prepared in this laboratory showed false positive results in 13% and 10.8% of the samples, and false negative results in 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. in the 3 category classification system of nccls, the mic break points proposed are defined sensitive (s) for mic less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and resistant (r) for mic greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. in this study, the 30 micrograms disc tests using the above-mentioned 2 different types of discs resulted in false positive responses in 6.3% and 5.2% of the samples tested and false negative results in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == microbial adherence on poly(methyl methacrylate) (pmma) surfaces.
AB  == infection remains a major complication following the use of implanted biomaterials. often these infections are caused by low-virulence organisms or by  a mixture of organisms (polymicrobial). in this study two methods were used to quantitate the bacteria which had adhered to poly(methyl methacrylate) (pmma) samples. the bacteria were eluted from the sample using an ultrasonic cleaner. the number eluted was then counted by colony counts, which determines viable organisms and by particle counting which counts both viable and nonviable organisms. a known adherent strain of staphylococcus epidermidis and a strain of  proteus mirabilis were used. in general the adherence of s. epidermidis was greater than that of proteus. when the two organisms were used together, there was an alteration in the adherence pattern which generally increased the adherence of proteus and had no effect or decreased the adherence of s. epidermidis. the use of both quantitation techniques provided important information on the adherence of organisms to pmma to which gentamicin had been added. it was evident that organisms did adhere to the pmma plus gentamicin samples but were not viable when eluted. the amount of adherence to pmma plus gentamicin was similar to that of pmma alone at 30 min but was markedly decreased at 24 h. there was a considerable dead biofilm mass on the pmma plus gentamicin samples which might be a significant promoter of late infections by providing a surface attractive to other strains of bacteria.

TI  == biofilm and scleral buckle-associated infections. a mechanism for persistence.
AB  == scleral buckle infections tend to be persistent as well as resistant to antimicrobial treatment. often, scleral buckle infections require removal of the  buckling elements for resolution. to determine if bacteria are able to persist on scleral buckles by elaborating a glycocalyx matrix or biofilm that offers protection against host defenses and antimicrobial treatment, the authors cultured 28 scleral buckle elements removed for infection and extrusion. bacteria were isolated from 18 elements (64%). the most frequently isolated bacteria were  staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (8), staphylococcus aureus (3), corynebacteria (3), mycobacterium chelonei (3), and proteus mirabilis (3). eleven (65%) of 17 buckles evaluated with scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of bacteria encased in biofilm. biofilm was demonstrated on the surfaces and ends of solid silicon elements. in the silicon sponges, biofilm also extended into the matrix of the sponges. the authors believe that bacterial production of biofilm offers an explanation for the persistence of scleral buckle infections and their ability to withstand antimicrobial treatment.

AB  == fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. two hundred thirty-one  patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90%  of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of enterococcus faecalis were  4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates  of escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of proteus mirabilis 0.25  and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. in summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety  of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  == effect of staphylococcus epidermidis on adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis to polymethyl methacrylate (pmma) and gentamicin-containing pmma.
AB  == the goals of this study were to determine 1) effect of staphylococcus epidermidis adherence and biofilm production on adherence of the opportunistic pathogens proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to polymethyl methacrylate (pmma); 2) if the biofilm killed by autoclaving altered adherence of other organisms; 3)  if adherence of s. epidermidis to gentamicin-containing pmma altered adherence of the opportunistic pathogens p. mirabilis and p. aeruginosa to gentamicin-containing pmma. results show that biofilms formed by s. epidermidis,  whether alive or dead, significantly increased adherence of pseudomonas. adherence of proteus was significantly increased on dead biofilms and increased,  but not significantly (p = less than 0.1), on live ones. greatest adherence seen  in the study was to autoclaved biofilms. significant adherence of proteus and pseudomonas was found on gentamicin-containing pmma specimens, which were preincubated with s. epidermidis for formation on the biofilm. these results indicate that a biofilm is formed on pmma-gentamicin specimens and this may impair the ability of gentamicin to kill other organisms.

AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == the in-vitro assessment of a collagen/vicryl (polyglactin) composite film together with candidate suture materials for potential use in urinary tract surgery. iii. adherence of bacteria to the material surface.
AB  == a collagen/vicryl (polyglactin) composite membrane (developed for use in urinary  tract surgery) has been incubated in cultures of radioactively labelled urinary tract pathogens vis escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, and proteus mirabilis for up to 1 h. for comparison, collagen film, vicryl mesh, and a number of absorbable and non-absorbable sutures were similarly tested. following incubation, samples were also examined by scanning electron microscopy. under the experimental conditions employed, only minimal adherence of the micro-organisms to the collagen coated vicryl mesh, its two individual components, as well as vicryl and nylon sutures was observed. significantly greater numbers of bacteria, however, adhered to silk and chromic catgut. the results suggest that adherence of microorganisms to the prosthesis even in infected urine is unlikely to develop into a microcolony of bacteria. however, it should be emphasised that great care  must be exercised when extrapolating from the in-vitro to the in-vivo situation.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == endotoxin provocation of experimental renal cystic disease.
AB  == germ free rats provide a unique model in which to assess biological response to environment. in 48 germ-free male, sprague-dawley rats we examined the consequences of oral exposure to nordihydroguaiaretic acid (ndga), a nephrotoxin; to staphylococcus epidermidis and bacillus species, non-endotoxin-containing bacteria; to escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, endotoxin-containing bacteria; and injected e. coli endotoxin on peripheral leukocyte counts and renal morphology. morphological changes were evaluated by light microscopy and scored blindly on a 0 to 4+ scale for 15 parameters of renal structure. means of these renal "pathology scores" correlated with counts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. the highest counts and scores were found in rats given ndga and exposed to endotoxin, either by injection or by oral feeding of endotoxin-containing bacteria. counts and scores were lower in the absence of endotoxin and with non-endotoxin-containing bacteria, given alone or in combination with either ndga or endotoxin. results exclude bacterial colonization and intrarenal accumulation of ndga as causes of nephropathy. they indicate that endotoxin and ndga act synergistically to provoke renal damage in the germ free ndga-fed rat and suggest that leukocytes are involved in the process.

AB  == to study the transfer of cefuzonam (czon, l-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. when czon 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. the area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms x hr/ml. from these results czon was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary  against infections of staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteroides fragilis. in 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of czon was good in  2 cases and unknown in the other case.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, cgp 31608.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

TI  == microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  == the potential of octenidine hydrochloride (win 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. semilogarithmic survival curves were  plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against staphylococcus aureus. the microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and candida albicans. death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microm (0.94 microgram/ml)  caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and e. coli and c. albicans were the least susceptible. octenidine was more active than  chlorhexidine against each test strain. skin-degerming activities of aqueous and  formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. aqueous  octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.

TI  == imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of intraabdominal infections: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  == imipenem is a new broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic, which when administered  with cilastatin may be a suitable alternative to the combination of an aminoglycoside and either clindamycin or a nitroimidazole as therapy for intraabdominal infections. the clinical and microbiologic results for 164 assessable patients given imipenem/cilastatin for intraabdominal infections are reported. only three of 416 bacterial strains isolated prior to therapy from intraabdominal infection sites were resistant to imipenem (one of staphylococcus  epidermidis, one of morganella morganii, and one of the fusobacterium varium). resistance acquired during treatment was reported in four cases: for three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and for one strain of proteus mirabilis. of 412 strains susceptible to imipenem prior to therapy, 359 were eradicated during treatment. the frequency of clinical cure or improvement was 91%. imipenem/cilastatin seems to be a useful alternative to the combination of an aminoglycoside with either clindamycin or a nitroimidazole.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  == 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. on the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (mic90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria  gonorrhoeae and staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall mic90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin b against klebsiella pneumoniae (mic90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin b against pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against staphylococcus aureus, (mic90 =  2 mg/l in each case). along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (mic90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against moraxella species. compared to erythromycin (mic90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (mic90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and  antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. these results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.

TI  == aminoglycoside resistance among blood culture isolates.
AB  == a total of 633 blood culture isolates were collected from 1981 to 1982 from seven major finnish hospitals, including all university central hospitals. susceptibility of the strains to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and netilmicin was determined by the sensititre microtiter procedure. resistance against any of  these agents occurred in 1.3 to 6.5% of all strains studied. in the turku university central hospital, an increased number of tobramycin- and gentamicin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were found; the frequency of strains resistant to tobramycin was 57% and to gentamicin was 29% versus frequencies of 16 and 18%, respectively, which were observed in the other hospitals. an explanation for this might be a change in the use of aminoglycosides in the turku university central hospital; within 3 years, 1979 to 1981, the consumption of tobramycin and amikacin had increased 330 and 290%, respectively, whereas the use of gentamicin had decreased to 24% of that in the beginning of the period. resistance against tobramycin was mediated by enzymes aph(2")-aac(6') and ant(4').

TI  == inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  == since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, alcaligenes faecalis, neisseria meningitidis and species of salmonella, enterobacter, pseudomonas and providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. at concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. however, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. growth  in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. the results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron  which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.

TI  == efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  == ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. the bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. there were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. no serious drug toxicities were observed. at a dosage regimen of 1 g  every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.

TI  == [the frequency of bacteriuria in pregnancy].
AB  == the authors present the results of a bacteriological urine analysis of 1774 pregnant women controlled in the gynecological dispensary pescenica in zagreb. in 2824 examined urine specimens sterile urinocultures were found in 67.6% and bacteriuria in 32.4%. significant findings of bacteriuria were recorded in 10.5%  and insignificant ones in 21.9% of the specimens. the most common bacteria were e. coli (45.24%), then staphylococcus albus epidermidis (17.4%), staphylococcus pyogenes aureus (14.64%), proteus mirabilis (9.39%), and enterococcus (5.24%). urine specimens were taken by the dip slide method. a rather high percentage of significant asymptomatic bacteriurias (10.5%) suggests the early detection and therapy in urinary infections as the best prevention of pyelonephritis gravidarum and gestosis. a routine bacteriological urine analysis in pregnant women should be one of the factors included in prenatal care.

TI  == a comparison of the in vitro activity of cefoxitin and cephalothin against 7,312  clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefoxitin and cephalothin was tested against 7,312  clinical isolates of aerobic pathogens. cefoxitin was found to have a broad spectrum of activity. among the gram-positive cocci, 99.1% of staphylococcus aureus, 94.4% of staphylococcus epidermidis and 98.1% of streptococci group b had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 microgram/ml or less, while only 4.6% of enterococci were sensitive to this concentration of cefoxitin. among the gram-negative rods 94.4% of escherichia coli, 89.3% of klebsiella spp., 97.3% of  proteus mirabilis, 97.4% of proteus vulgaris and 79.3% of proteus morganii were sensitive to 16 microgram/ml of cefoxitin or less. the effect of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter calcoaceticus was negligible. cefoxitin was less active than cephalothin against gram-positive cocci, the difference being most pronounced against enterococci. cephalothin was also found to be more active than cefoxitin  against p. mirabilis, while cefoxitin was superior to cephalothin against e. coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., p. vulgaris and p. morganii.

TI  == in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
AB  == n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin g, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. all of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. more than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of staphylococcus aureus and 80% of s. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by n-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. it inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than  ticarcillin. all 16 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. the marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it  a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == trimethoprim resistance in finland after five years' use of plain trimethoprim.
AB  == a total of 1388 urinary bacterial pathogens were tested for resistance to plain trimethoprim after five years' use of this drug for prophylaxis against urinary tract infections. samples were obtained in turku, finland, where use of the drug  is much greater than in other parts of finland. resistance to trimethoprim (greater than 8 mg/l; agar-dilution method) occurred in 20.3% of strains isolated from outpatients and 39.8% of strains isolated from inpatients. escherichia coli  and micrococcus showed low incidences of resistance (11% and 13% respectively in  ouptatients and 23% and 19% respectively in inpatients); enterobacter, streptococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis occupied an intermediate position; and proteus mirabilis and klebsiella were resistant in 41-76% of cases. similar incidences of resistance were observed to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, and nitrofurantoin. these findings together with the rare occurrence of side effects and convenient dosage confirm the usefulness  of plain trimethoprim for urinary tract infection.

TI  == storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  == microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20c and at -70c of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella as test organisms. the stability at -20c and -70c of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using staphylococcus eureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  enterococcus, and alpha streptococcus as the test organisms. no significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70c, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. no significant differences were noted at -20c for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. by ten  weeks' storage at -20c, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin,  ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.
