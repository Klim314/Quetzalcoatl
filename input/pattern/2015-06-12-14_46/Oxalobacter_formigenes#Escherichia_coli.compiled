TI  - Function and X-ray crystal structure of Escherichia coli YfdE.
AB  - Many food plants accumulate oxalate, which humans absorb but do not metabolize, leading to the formation of urinary stones. The commensal bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes consumes oxalate by converting it to oxalyl-CoA, which is decarboxylated by oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (OXC). OXC and the class III CoA-transferase formyl-CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase (FCOCT) are widespread among bacteria, including many that have no apparent ability to degrade or to resist external oxalate. The EvgA acid response regulator activates transcription of the Escherichia coli yfdXWUVE operon encoding YfdW (FCOCT), YfdU (OXC), and YfdE, a class III CoA-transferase that is ~30% identical to YfdW. YfdW and YfdU are necessary and sufficient for oxalate-induced protection against a subsequent acid challenge; neither of the other genes has a known function. We report the purification, in vitro characterization, 2.1-A crystal structure, and functional assignment of YfdE. YfdE and UctC, an orthologue from the obligate aerobe Acetobacter aceti, perform the reversible conversion of acetyl-CoA and oxalate to oxalyl-CoA and acetate. The annotation of YfdE as acetyl-CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase (ACOCT) expands the scope of metabolic pathways linked to oxalate catabolism and the oxalate-induced acid tolerance response. FCOCT and ACOCT active sites contain distinctive, conserved active site loops (the glycine-rich loop and the GNxH loop, respectively) that appear to encode substrate specificity.
TI  - Transfer of intestinal microbiota from lean donors increases insulin sensitivity  in individuals with metabolic syndrome.
AB  - Alterations in intestinal microbiota are associated with obesity and insulin resistance. We studied the effects of infusing intestinal microbiota from lean donors to male recipients with metabolic syndrome on the recipients' microbiota composition and glucose metabolism. Subjects were assigned randomly to groups that were given small intestinal infusions of allogenic or autologous microbiota. Six weeks after infusion of microbiota from lean donors, insulin sensitivity of recipients increased (median rate of glucose disappearance changed from 26.2 to 45.3 mumol/kg/min; P < .05) along with levels of butyrate-producing intestinal microbiota. Intestinal microbiota might be developed as therapeutic agents to increase insulin sensitivity in humans; www.trialregister.nl; registered at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR1776).
TI  - Projection structure of a member of the amino acid/polyamine/organocation transporter superfamily.
AB  - The L-arginine/agmatine antiporter AdiC is a key component of the arginine-dependent extreme acid resistance system of Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that AdiC belongs to the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) transporter superfamily having sequence identities of 15-17% to eukaryotic and human APC transporters. For functional and structural characterization, we cloned, overexpressed, and purified wild-type AdiC and the point mutant AdiC-W293L, which is unable to bind and consequently transport L-arginine. Purified detergent-solubilized AdiC particles were dimeric. Reconstitution experiments yielded two-dimensional crystals of AdiC-W293L diffracting beyond 6 angstroms resolution from which we determined the projection structure at 6.5 angstroms resolution. The projection map showed 10-12 density peaks per monomer and suggested mainly tilted helices with the exception of one distinct perpendicular membrane spanning alpha-helix. Comparison of AdiC-W293L with the projection map of the oxalate/formate antiporter from Oxalobacter formigenes, a member from the major facilitator superfamily, indicated different structures. Thus, two-dimensional crystals of AdiC-W293L yielded the first detailed view of a transport protein from the APC superfamily at sub-nanometer resolution.
TI  - Differential substrate specificity and kinetic behavior of Escherichia coli YfdW  and Oxalobacter formigenes formyl coenzyme A transferase.
AB  - The yfdXWUVE operon appears to encode proteins that enhance the ability of Escherichia coli MG1655 to survive under acidic conditions. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic behavior remain to be elucidated, findings from structural genomic studies have shown that the structure of YfdW, the protein encoded by the yfdW gene, is homologous to that of the enzyme that mediates oxalate catabolism in the obligate anaerobe Oxalobacter formigenes, O. formigenes formyl coenzyme A transferase (FRC). We now report the first detailed examination of the steady-state kinetic behavior and substrate specificity of recombinant, wild-type YfdW. Our studies confirm that YfdW is a formyl coenzyme A (formyl-CoA) transferase, and YfdW appears to be more stringent than the corresponding enzyme (FRC) in Oxalobacter in employing formyl-CoA and oxalate as substrates. We also report the effects of replacing Trp-48 in the FRC active site with the glutamine residue that occupies an equivalent position in the E. coli protein. The results of these experiments show that Trp-48 precludes oxalate binding to a site that mediates substrate inhibition for YfdW. In addition, the replacement of Trp-48 by Gln-48 yields an FRC variant for which oxalate-dependent substrate inhibition is modified to resemble that seen for YfdW. Our findings illustrate the utility of structural homology in assigning enzyme function and raise the question of whether oxalate catabolism takes place in E. coli upon the up-regulation of the yfdXWUVE operon under acidic conditions.
TI  - Structural basis for activation of the thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase by adenosine diphosphate.
AB  - Oxalyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase is a thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme that plays an important role in the catabolism of the highly toxic compound oxalate. We have determined the crystal structure of the enzyme from Oxalobacter formigenes from a hemihedrally twinned crystal to 1.73 A resolution and characterized the steady-state kinetic behavior of the decarboxylase. The monomer of the tetrameric enzyme consists of three alpha/beta-type domains, commonly seen in this class of enzymes, and the thiamin diphosphate-binding site is located at the expected subunit-subunit interface between two of the domains with the cofactor bound in the conserved V-conformation. Although oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase is structurally homologous to acetohydroxyacid synthase, a molecule of ADP is bound in a region that is cognate to the FAD-binding site observed in acetohydroxyacid synthase and presumably fulfils a similar role in stabilizing the protein structure. This difference between the two enzymes may have physiological importance since oxalyl-CoA decarboxylation is an essential step in ATP generation in O. formigenes, and the decarboxylase activity is stimulated by exogenous ADP. Despite the significant degree of structural conservation between the two homologous enzymes and the similarity in catalytic mechanism to other thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes, the active site residues of oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase are unique. A suggestion for the reaction mechanism of the enzyme is presented.
TI  - Detection and characterization of merohedral twinning in crystals of oxalyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase from Oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  - Oxalyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase is a thiamin diphosphate dependent enzyme active  in the catabolism of the highly toxic compound oxalate. The enzyme from Oxalobacter formigenes has been expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and crystallized. Two crystal forms were obtained, one showing poor diffraction and the other merohedral twinning. Crystals in the former category belong to the tetragonal space group P4(2)2(1)2. Data to 4.1 A resolution were collected from these crystals and an incomplete low resolution structure was initially determined by molecular replacement. Crystals in the latter category were obtained by co-crystallizing the protein with coenzyme A, thiamin diphosphate and Mg(2+)-ions. Data to 1.73 A were collected from one of these crystals with apparent point group 622. The crystal was found to be heavily twinned, and a twin ratio of 0.43 was estimated consistently by different established methods. The true space group P3(1)21 was deduced, and a molecular replacement solution was obtained using the low resolution structure as template when searching in detwinned data.
TI  - Crystal structure of Escherichia coli crotonobetainyl-CoA: carnitine CoA-transferase (CaiB) and its complexes with CoA and carnitinyl-CoA.
AB  - L-Carnitine (R-[-]-3-hydroxy-4-trimethylaminobutyrate) is found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and participates in diverse processes including long-chain fatty-acid transport and osmoprotection. The enzyme crotonobetainyl/gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA:carnitine CoA-transferase (CaiB; E.C. 2.8.3.-) catalyzes the first step in carnitine metabolism, leading to the final product gamma-butyrobetaine. The crystal structures of Escherichia coli apo-CaiB, as well as its Asp169Ala mutant bound to CoA and to carnitinyl-CoA, have been determined and refined to 1.6, 2.4, and 2.4 A resolution, respectively. CaiB is composed of two identical circular chains that together form an intertwined dimer. Each monomer consists of a large domain, containing a Rossmann fold, and a small domain. The monomer and dimer resemble those of formyl-CoA transferase from Oxalobacter formigenes, as well as E. coli YfdW, a putative type-III CoA transferase of unknown function. The CoA cofactor-binding site is formed at the interface of the large domain of one monomer and the small domain from the second monomer. Most of the protein-CoA interactions are formed with the Rossmann fold domain. While the location of cofactor binding is similar in the three proteins, the specific CoA-protein interactions vary somewhat between CaiB, formyl-CoA transferase, and YfdW. CoA binding results in a change in the relative positions of the large and small domains compared with apo-CaiB. The observed carnitinyl-CoA product in crystals of the CaiB Asp169Ala mutant cocrystallized with crotonoyl-CoA and carnitine could result from (i) a catalytic mechanism involving a ternary enzyme-substrate complex, independent of a covalent anhydride intermediate with Asp169, (ii) a spontaneous reaction of the substrates in solution, followed by binding to the enzyme, or (iii) an involvement of another residue substituting functionally for Asp169, such as Glu23.
TI  - Characterization and heterologous expression of the oxalyl coenzyme A decarboxylase gene from Bifidobacterium lactis.
AB  - Oxalyl coenzyme A (CoA) decarboxylase (Oxc) is a key enzyme in the catabolism of  the highly toxic compound oxalate, catalyzing the decarboxylation of oxalyl-CoA to formyl-CoA. The gene encoding a novel oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase from Bifidobacterium lactis DSM 10140 (oxc) was identified and characterized. This strain, isolated from yogurt, showed the highest oxalate-degrading activity in a preliminary screening with 12 strains belonging to Bifidobacterium, an anaerobic intestinal bacterial group largely used in probiotic products. The oxc gene was isolated by probing a B. lactis genomic library with a probe obtained by amplification of the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase gene from Oxalobacter formigenes, an anaerobic bacterium of the human intestinal microflora. The oxc DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,773 bp encoding a deduced 590-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of about 63 kDa. Analysis of amino acid sequence showed a significant homology (47%) with oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase of O. formigenes and a typical thiamine pyrophosphate-binding site that has been reported for several decarboxylase enzymes. Primer extension experiments with oxc performed by using RNA isolated from B. lactis identified the transcriptional start site 28 bp upstream of the ATG start codon, immediately adjacent to a presumed promoter region. The protein overexpressed in Escherichia coli cross-reacted with an anti-O. formigenes oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase antibody. Enzymatic activity, when evaluated by capillary electrophoresis analysis, demonstrated that the consumption substrate oxalyl-CoA was regulated by a product inhibition of the enzyme. These findings suggest a potential role for Bifidobacterium in the intestinal degradation of oxalate.
TI  - The crystal structure of the Escherichia coli YfdW gene product reveals a new fold of two interlaced rings identifying a wide family of CoA transferases.
AB  - Because of its toxicity, oxalate accumulation from amino acid catabolism leads to acute disorders in mammals. Gut microflora are therefore pivotal in maintaining a safe intestinal oxalate balance through oxalate degradation. Oxalate catabolism was first identified in Oxalobacter formigenes, a specialized, strictly anaerobic bacterium. Oxalate degradation was found to be performed successively by two enzymes, a formyl-CoA transferase (frc) and an oxalate decarboxylase (oxc). These two genes are present in several bacterial genomes including that of Escherichia coli. The frc ortholog in E. coli is yfdW, with which it shares 61% sequence identity. We have expressed the YfdW open reading frame product and solved its crystal structure in the apo-form and in complex with acetyl-CoA and with a mixture of acetyl-CoA and oxalate. YfdW exhibits a novel and spectacular fold in which two monomers assemble as interlaced rings, defining the CoA binding site at their interface. From the structure of the complex with acetyl-CoA and oxalate, we propose a putative formyl/oxalate transfer mechanism involving the conserved catalytic residue Asp169. The similarity of yfdW with bacterial orthologs (approximately 60% identity) and paralogs (approximately 20-30% identity) suggests that this new fold and parts of the CoA transfer mechanism are likely to be the hallmarks of a wide family of CoA transferases.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of formyl-CoA tranferase from Oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  - Formyl-CoA transferase from Oxalobacter formigenes has been expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Crystals of formyl-CoA transferase were grown at 293 K using polyethylene glycol 4000 as a precipitant. The diffraction pattern of flash-frozen crystals at 100 K extends to 2.2 A resolution with synchrotron radiation (lambda = 0.933 nm). The crystals are tetragonal and belong to space group I4, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 151.44, c = 99.49 A. The asymmetric unit contains one dimer and the solvent content is 53%. Formyl-CoA transferase was crystallized both as the apoenzyme and as its complex with coenzyme A.
TI  - Involvement of coenzyme A esters and two new enzymes, an enoyl-CoA hydratase and  a CoA-transferase, in the hydration of crotonobetaine to L-carnitine by Escherichia coli.
AB  - Two proteins (CaiB and CaiD) were found to catalyze the reversible biotransformation of crotonobetaine to L-carnitine in Escherichia coli in the presence of a cosubstrate (e.g., gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA or crotonobetainyl-CoA). CaiB (45 kDa) and CaiD (27 kDa) were purified in two steps to electrophoretic homogeneity from overexpression strains. CaiB was identified as crotonobetainyl-CoA:carnitine CoA-transferase by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. The enzyme exhibits high cosubstrate specificity to CoA derivatives of trimethylammonium compounds. In particular, the N-terminus of CaiB shows significant identity with other CoA-transferases (e.g., FldA from Clostridium sporogenes, Frc from Oxalobacter formigenes, and BbsE from Thauera aromatica) and CoA-hydrolases (e.g., BaiF from Eubacterium sp.). CaiD was shown to be a crotonobetainyl-CoA hydratase using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. Besides crotonobetainyl-CoA CaiD is also able to hydrate crotonyl-CoA with a significantly lower Vmax (factor of 10(3)) but not crotonobetaine. The substrate specificity of CaiD and its homology to the crotonase confirm this enzyme as a new member of the crotonase superfamily. Concluding these results, it was verified that hydration of crotonobetaine to L-carnitine proceeds at the CoA level in two steps: the CaiD catalyzed hydration of crotonobetainyl-CoA to L-carnitinyl-CoA, followed by a CoA transfer from L-carnitinyl-CoA to crotonobetaine, catalyzed by CaiB. When gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA was used as a cosubstrate (CoA donor), the first reaction is the CoA transfer. The optimal ratios of CaiB and CaiD during this hydration reaction, determined to be 4:1 when crotonobetainyl-CoA was used as cosubstrate and 5:1 when gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA was used as cosubstrate, are different from that found for in vivo conditions (1:3).
TI  - DNA sequencing and expression of the formyl coenzyme A transferase gene, frc, from Oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  - Oxalic acid, a highly toxic by-product of metabolism, is catabolized by a limited number of bacterial species utilizing an activation-decarboxylation reaction which yields formate and CO2. frc, the gene encoding formyl coenzyme A transferase, an enzyme which transfers a coenzyme A moiety to activate oxalic acid, was cloned from the bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes. DNA sequencing revealed a single open reading frame of 1,284 bp capable of encoding a 428-amino-acid protein. A presumed promoter region and a rho-independent termination sequence suggest that this gene is part of a monocistronic operon. A PCR fragment containing the open reading frame, when overexpressed in Escherichia coli, produced a product exhibiting enzymatic activity similar to the purified native enzyme. With this, the two genes necessary for bacterial catabolism of oxalate, frc and oxc, have now been cloned, sequenced, and expressed.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression in escherichia coli of OxlT, the oxalate:formate exchange protein of Oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  - OxlT is the oxalate/formate exchange protein that represents the vectorial component of a proton-motive metabolic cycle in Oxalobacter formigenes. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of OxlT and describe its expression in Escherichia coli. The OxlT amino acid sequence specifies a polytopic hydrophobic protein of 418 residues with a mass of 44,128 daltons. Analysis of hydropathy and consideration of the distribution of charged residues suggests an OxlT secondary structure having 12 transmembrane segments, oriented so that the N and C termini face the cytoplasm. Expression of OxlT in E. coli coincides with appearance of a capacity to carry out the self-exchange of oxalate and the heterologous, electrogenic exchange of oxalate with formate. The unusually high velocity of OxlT-mediated transport is also preserved in E. coli. We conclude that the essential features of OxlT are retained on its expression in E. coli.
TI  - Bacterial anion exchange: reductionist and integrative approaches to membrane biology.
AB  - Studies of two different bacterial anion exchange proteins (antiporters) led us to conclude that both reductionist and integrative approaches contribute to progress in understanding membrane biology. We have used a reductionist perspective in applying cysteine scanning mutagenesis to probe individual amino acid positions of UhpT (uptake of hexose phosphate transporter), the carrier responsible for transport of glucose 6-phosphate by Escherichia coli. This work has established experimental criteria that should allow one to identify and localize the translocation pathway in such membrane proteins. An integrative view is exemplified by work with OxlT (oxalate transporter), the carrier used by an anaerobe Oxalobacter formigenes to catalyze the antiport of divalent oxalate and monovalent formate. The activity of OxlT is functionally coordinated with that of a cytosolic oxalyl decarboxylase; together, these vectorial and scalar activities constitute a metabolic proton pump, allowing O. formigenes to display decarboxylative phosphorylation. The role played by OxlT argues that membrane carriers can assume unanticipated emergent properties when their biochemical functions are properly articulated in relation to other aspects of cell function.
TI  - Molecular cloning, DNA sequence, and gene expression of the oxalyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase gene, oxc, from the bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  - Oxalic acid, a highly toxic by-product of metabolism, is catabolized by a limited number of bacterial species by an activation-decarboxylation reaction which yields formate and CO2. oxc, the gene encoding the oxalic acid-degrading enzyme oxalyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase, was cloned from the bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes. The DNA sequence revealed a single open reading frame of 1,704 bp capable of encoding a 568-amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of 60,691. The identification of a presumed promoter region and a rho-independent termination sequence indicates that this gene is not part of a polycistronic operon. A PCR fragment encoding the open reading frame, when overexpressed in Escherichia coli, produced a product which cross-reacted antigenically with native enzyme on Western blots (immunoblots), appeared to form homodimers spontaneously, and exhibited enzymatic activity similar to that of the purified native enzyme.
TI  - Identification, purification, and reconstitution of OxlT, the oxalate: formate antiport protein of Oxalobacter formigenes.
AB  - We had proposed earlier that the anaerobe Oxalobacter formigenes sustains a proton-motive force by exploiting a secondary carrier rather than a primary proton pump. In this view, a carrier protein would catalyze the exchange of extracellular oxalate, a divalent anion, and intracellular formate, the monovalent product of oxalate decarboxylation. Such an electrogenic exchange develops an internally negative membrane potential, and since the decarboxylation reaction consumes an internal proton, the combined activity of the carrier and the soluble decarboxylase would constitute an "indirect" proton pump with a stoichiometry of 1H+ per turnover. This model is now verified by identification and purification of OxlT, the protein responsible for the anion exchange reaction. Membranes of O. formigenes were solubilized at pH 7 with 1.25% octyl glucoside in 20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid/K, in the presence of 0.4% Escherichia coli phospholipids and with 20% glucerol present as the osmolyte stabilant. Rapid methods for reconstitution were developed to monitor the distribution of OxlT during biochemical fractionation, allowing its purification by sequential anion and cation exchange chromatography. OxlT proved to be a single hydrophobic polypeptide, of 38 kDa mobility during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with a turnover number estimated as at least 1000/s. The properties of OxlT point to an indirect proton pump as the mechanism by which a proton-motive force arises in O. formigenes, and one may reasonably argue that indirect proton pumps take part in bacterial events such as acetogenesis, malolactate fermentation, and perhaps methanogenesis.
TI  - Oxalate:formate exchange. The basis for energy coupling in Oxalobacter.
AB  - In the Gram-negative anaerobe, Oxalobacter formigenes, the generation of metabolic energy depends on the transport and decarboxylation of oxalate. We have now used assays of reconstitution to study the movements of oxalate and to characterize the exchange of oxalate with formate, its immediate metabolic derivative. Membranes of O. formigenes were solubilized with octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside in the presence of 20% glycerol and Escherichia coli phospholipid, and detergent extracts were reconstituted by detergent dilution. [14C]Oxalate was taken up by proteoliposomes loaded with unlabeled oxalate, but not by similarly loaded liposomes or by proteoliposomes containing sulfate in place of oxalate. Oxalate transport did not depend on the presence of sodium or potassium, nor was it affected by valinomycin (1 microM), nigericin (1 microM), or a proton conductor, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (5 microM) when potassium was at equal concentration on either side of the membrane. Such data suggest the presence of an overall neutral oxalate self-exchange, independent of common cations or anions. Kinetic analysis of the reaction in proteoliposomes gave a Michaelis constant (Kt) for oxalate transport of 0.24 mM and a maximal velocity (Vmax) of 99 mumol/min/mg of protein. A direct exchange of oxalate and formate was indicated by the observations that formate inhibited oxalate transport and that delayed addition of formate released [14C]oxalate accumulated during oxalate exchange. Moreover, [14C]formate was taken up by oxalate-loaded proteoliposomes (but not liposomes), and this heterologous reaction could be blocked by external oxalate. Further studies, using formate-loaded proteoliposomes, suggested that the heterologous exchange was electrogenic. Thus, for assays in which N-methylglucamine served as both internal and external cation, formate-loaded particles took up oxalate at a rate of 2.4 mumol/min/mg of protein. When external or internal N-methylglucamine was replaced by potassium in the presence of valinomycin, there was, respectively, a 7-fold stimulation or an 8-fold inhibition of oxalate accumulation, demonstrating that net negative charge moved in parallel with oxalate during the heterologous exchange. The work summarized here suggests the presence of an unusually rapid and electrogenic oxalate2-:formate1- antiport in membranes of O. formigenes. Since a proton is consumed during the intracellular decarboxylation that converts oxalate into formate plus CO2, antiport of oxalate and formate would play a central role in a biochemical cycle consisting of (a) oxalate influx, (b) oxalate decarboxylation, and (c) formate efflux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
