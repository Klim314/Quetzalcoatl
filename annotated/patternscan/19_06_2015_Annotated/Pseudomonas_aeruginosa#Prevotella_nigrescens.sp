TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == relative contribution of prevotella intermedia and pseudomonas aeruginosa to lung pathology in airways of patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == background: patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) with pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections produce endobronchial mucus plugs allowing growth of obligate anaerobes including prevotella spp. whether obligate anaerobes contribute to the  pathophysiology of cf lung disease is unknown. methods: the virulence of prevotella intermedia and ps aeruginosa was investigated in vitro and in mice, antibodies against p intermedia in cf sera were assessed and a culture-independent detection method for p intermedia/p nigrescens in cf sputum was tested. results: p intermedia reached cell numbers of >10(5)->10(7)&emsp14;colony-forming units (cfu)/ml sputum. the majority of patients with cf (16/17; 94.1%) produced antibodies against two immunoreactive antigens of p intermedia. culture supernatant fluids, collected from 10(9) p intermedia cells, were more cytotoxic to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro and inflammatory in mouse lungs than respective fluids from anaerobically grown ps aeruginosa, while fluids from aerobically grown ps aeruginosa had the highest  cytotoxicity and inflammation. both pathological effects were largely reduced when culture supernatant fluids from 10(7) cells of either species were used. p intermedia cells ( approximately 10(6)cfu/lung) did not induce mortality in the agar beads lung infection mouse model, while ps aeruginosa cells caused death in  30% of mice due to rapid multiplication. a p intermedia/p nigrescens-specific pna probe was significantly more sensitive than culture-dependent diagnostic assays to detect these strict anaerobes. conclusion: ps aeruginosa and p intermedia become significantly virulent in vitro and in vivo when cell numbers exceed 10(8) cfu/lung.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of moxifloxacin against gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: gram-negative enteric rods were associated with periodontal diseases  in several populations. the association between enteric and putative periodontal  pathogens has received little attention in the literature. the present investigation determined the occurrence and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: clinical parameters and the in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods were examined in 76 patients with chronic periodontitis in medellin, colombia. subgingival samples were processed using culture and biochemical tests for the detection of periodontal and superinfecting pathogens. selected colonies of gram-negative enteric rods from pure cultures were used to test the susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. chi-square and mann-whitney tests were used to determine differences in clinical variables versus the presence or absence of gram-negative enteric rods. results: klebsiella pneumoniae was found in 12 patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in four patients, and three other species were recovered with a lower prevalence. men (38.75%) tended to harbor more of the studied organisms than women (17.7%) (p = 0.04). gram-negative enteric rods in periodontal pockets correlated positively with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (respectively, r = 0.66, 0.31, and 0.32; p <0.001). all superinfecting organisms demonstrated a high susceptibility to moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin but exhibited a variable susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. conclusions: this study found high levels of gram-negative enteric rods in  patients with chronic periodontitis. moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin appeared capable of eradicating these organisms from periodontal pockets. its good activity against gram-negative enteric rods and periodontopathogens suggests the  potential use of moxifloxacin as an adjunctive antibiotic in the treatment of mixed periodontal infections.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.
