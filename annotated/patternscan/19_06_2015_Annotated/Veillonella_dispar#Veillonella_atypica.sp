TI  == the interaction between streptococcus spp. and veillonella tobetsuensis in the early stages of oral biofilm formation.
AB  == dental plaque is a multispecies oral biofilm, the development of which is initiated by adherence of the pioneer streptococcus spp. oral veillonella spp., including v. atypica, v. denticariosi, v. dispar, v. parvula, v. rogosae, and v.  tobetsuensis, are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation. these species have been reported to co-aggregate with streptococcus spp. in a metabolic cooperation-dependent manner to form biofilms in human oral cavities, especially  in the early stages of biofilm formation. however, in our previous study, streptococcus gordonii showed biofilm formation to the greatest extent in the presence of v. tobetsuensis, without co-aggregation between species. these results suggest that v. tobetsuensis produces signaling molecules that promote the proliferation of s. gordonii in biofilm formation. it is well known in many bacterial species that the quorum-sensing (qs) system regulates diverse functions such as biofilm formation. however, little is known about the qs system with autoinducers (ais), between veillonella and streptococcus. recently, ai-1 and ai-2 were detected and identified in the culture supernatants of v. tobetsuensis  as strong signaling molecules in biofilm formation with s. gordonii. in particular, the supernatant from v. tobetsuensis showed the highest ai-2 activity among 6 oral veillonella species, indicating that ais, mainly ai-2, produced by v. tobetsuensis may be important factors and may facilitate biofilm formation of  s. gordonii. clarifying the mechanism that underlies the qs system between s. gordonii and v. tobetsuensis may lead to the development of novel methods for the prevention of oral infectious diseases caused by oral biofilms.

TI  == development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == background: dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. the principal method of prevention  is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. in-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. the aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the calgary biofilm device (cbd) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. the specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. results: pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. a mean of 320 and 250 otus were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm  samples, respectively. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. in addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (amova). there were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (amova, p < 0.002). pcoa revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (amova, p < 0.001). veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant otus detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst prevotella oralis, v. parvula and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. conclusions: diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the cbd. biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. this model could be used to screen  both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.

TI  == transcriptomic analysis of three veillonella spp. present in carious dentine and  in the saliva of caries-free individuals.
AB  == veillonella spp. are predominant bacteria found in all oral biofilms. in this study, a metatranscriptomic approach was used to investigate the gene expression  levels of three oral veillonella spp. (v. parvula, v. dispar and v. atypica) in whole stimulated saliva from caries-free volunteers and in carious lesions (n = 11 for each group). in the lesions the greatest proportion of reads were assigned to v. parvula and genes with the highest level of expression in carious samples were those coding for membrane transport systems. all three veillonella spp. increased expression of genes involved in the catabolism of lactate and succinate, notably the alpha- and beta-subunits of l(+)-tartrate dehydratase (ec  4.2.1.32). there was also significantly increased expression of histidine biosynthesis pathway in v. parvula, suggesting higher intra-cellular levels of histidine that could provide intra-cellular buffering capacity and, therefore, assist survival in the acidic environment. various other systems such as potassium uptake systems were also up regulated that may aid in the survival and  proliferation of v. parvula in carious lesions.

TI  == the influence of oral veillonella species on biofilms formed by streptococcus species.
AB  == oral veillonella, veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, veillonella rogosae, and veillonella tobetsuensis are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation. to investigate the role  of oral veillonella, biofilms formed by the co-culture of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or streptococcus sanguinis, with  oral veillonella were examined at the species level. the amount of biofilm formed by s. mutans, s. gordonii, and s. salivarius in the presence of the six veillonella species was greater than that formed in the control experiments, with the exception of s. mutans with v. dispar. in contrast, in the case of biofilm formation by s. sanguinis, the presence of veillonella species reduced the amount of the biofilm, with the exception of v. parvula and v. dispar. the time-dependent changes in the amount of biofilm and the number of planktonic cells were grouped into four patterns over the 24 combinations. only that of s. gordonii with v. tobetsuensis showed a unique pattern. these results indicate that the mode of action of this combination differed from that of the other combinations with respect to biofilm formation. it is possible that there may be  several factors involved in the interaction between streptococcus and veillonella species.

TI  == effects of ph and lactate on hydrogen sulfide production by oral veillonella spp.
AB  == indigenous oral bacteria in the tongue coating such as veillonella have been identified as the main producers of hydrogen sulfide (h2s), one of the major components of oral malodor. however, there is little information on the physiological properties of h2s production by oral veillonella such as metabolic  activity and oral environmental factors which may affect h2s production. thus, in the present study, the h2s-producing activity of growing cells, resting cells, and cell extracts of oral veillonella species and the effects of oral environmental factors, including ph and lactate, were investigated. type strains  of veillonella atypica, veillonella dispar, and veillonella parvula were used. these veillonella species produced h2s during growth in the presence of l-cysteine. resting cells of these bacteria produced h2s from l-cysteine, and the cell extracts showed enzymatic activity to convert l-cysteine to h2s. h2s production by resting cells was higher at ph 6 to 7 and lower at ph 5. the presence of lactate markedly increased h2s production by resting cells (4.5- to 23.7-fold), while lactate had no effect on enzymatic activity in cell extracts. in addition to h2s, ammonia was produced in cell extracts of all the strains, indicating that h2s was produced by the catalysis of cystathionine gamma-lyase (ec 4.4.1.1). serine was also produced in cell extracts of v. atypica and v. parvula, suggesting the involvement of cystathionine beta-synthase lyase (ec 4.2.1.22) in these strains. this study indicates that veillonella produce h2s from l-cysteine and that their h2s production can be regulated by oral environmental factors, namely, ph and lactate.

TI  == identification of veillonella tobetsuensis in tongue biofilm by using a species-specific primer pair.
AB  == veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, and veillonella rogosae have been reported to be isolated from human oral cavities. the recently detected veillonellatobetsuensis in human tongue biofilms was proposed as a novel veillonella sp. in this study, to determine the  distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis, we established a method for the detection and identification of v. tobetsuensis by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using a species-specific primer pair. the primer pair for v. tobetsuensis was designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 70-kda heat shock protein (dnak) gene of v. tobetsuensis jcm 17976(t) (=atcc baa-2400(t)). the primer pair generated a specific pcr product for v. tobetsuensis but not for other oral veillonella spp. with the pcr procedure using the primer pair, we could detect less than 10 ng of genomic dna extracted from v. tobetsuensis. thus, the pcr method using this primer pair is suitable for the specific detection and identification of v. tobetsuensis. the distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis were investigated by pcr using this species-specific primer pair. v. tobetsuensis was detected in 5 of 27 subjects. v. tobetsuensis was recovered from 19% (5/27) of subjects with other veillonella species. and, prevalence of v. tobetsuensis ranged from 7.6% to 20.0% in these subjects. v. tobetsuensis is likely to coexist with other veillonella spp. in tongue biofilm.  in this study, the species-specific pcr primer pair for v. tobetsuensis was designed using partial sequences of the dnak gene. this is the first report using a species-specific primer pair for pcr to determine the distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis in tongue biofilm.

TI  == diversity of human small intestinal streptococcus and veillonella populations.
AB  == molecular and cultivation approaches were employed to study the phylogenetic richness and temporal dynamics of streptococcus and veillonella populations in the small intestine. microbial profiling of human small intestinal samples collected from four ileostomy subjects at four time points displayed abundant populations of streptococcus spp. most affiliated with s. salivarius, s. thermophilus, and s. parasanguinis, as well as veillonella spp. affiliated with v. atypica, v. parvula, v. dispar, and v. rogosae. relative abundances varied per subject and time of sampling. streptococcus and veillonella isolates were cultured using selective media from ileostoma effluent samples collected at two time points from a single subject. the richness of the streptococcus and veillonella isolates was assessed at species and strain level by 16s rrna gene sequencing and genetic fingerprinting, respectively. a total of 160 streptococcus and 37 veillonella isolates were obtained. genetic fingerprinting differentiated  seven streptococcus lineages from ileostoma effluent, illustrating the strain richness within this ecosystem. the veillonella isolates were represented by a single phylotype. our study demonstrated that the small intestinal streptococcus  populations displayed considerable changes over time at the genetic lineage level because only representative strains of a single streptococcus lineage could be cultivated from ileostoma effluent at both time points.

TI  == the distribution and frequency of oral veillonella spp. in the tongue biofilm of  healthy young adults.
AB  == five species of oral veillonella, v. atypica, v. denticariosi, v. dispar, v. parvula, and v. rogosae, have been suggested to be early colonizers of dental biofilm and causes of opportunistic infections and oral malodor. however, the pathogenicity and the distribution of oral veillonella spp. have not been clarified. previously, oral veillonella spp. were identified by using 16s rdna sequence analysis. in addition, recently, veillonella isolates from human tongue  biofilm were identified by rpob gene sequences, but these procedures are time-consuming and complex. to overcome this problem, igarashi et al. have designed species-specific primer sets for oral veillonella spp. by using a highly variable region in the rpob gene. in the present study, the distribution and frequency of oral veillonella spp. in the tongue biofilm of healthy adults in their 20s were examined by using these species-specific primer sets. tongue biofilms of these subjects were found to be divided into two groups based on the  distribution and frequency of oral veillonella spp. in one group, v. rogosae was  the predominant species; the other group consisted of mainly v. dispar and v. atypica. multiple factors may influence these differences in distribution and frequency of oral veillonella spp. in tongue biofilm. this is the first report also demonstrating the availability of the species-specific primer sets for pcr to determine the distribution and frequency of oral veillonella spp. in the tongue biofilm of healthy adults in their 20s.

TI  == identification of oral species of the genus veillonella by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == introduction: members of the genus veillonella cannot be reliably distinguished by their biochemical characteristics and phenotypic features. moreover, dna-dna hybridization and sequence analyses of the 16s ribosomal rna gene including random fragment length polymorphism analysis, are complex and time-consuming procedures that are not well-suited to identifying oral species of veillonella: veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, and veillonella rogosae. methods: in this study, five forward primers and a reverse primer were designed for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) according  to the partial sequences of the rpob genes of these oral veillonella species. results: the forward primers were species-specific for these five veillonella species, and could produce specific amplicons when used together with reverse primer and individual dna templates of these species in pcr. these primer pairs were also found to discriminate between the respective species, and the veillonella strains isolated from human oral cavities were successfully assigned  to one of the five oral species of the genus veillonella based on their specific  products by pcr. conclusion: a simple two-step pcr procedure using the five sets  of primer pairs developed in the present study is a rapid and reliable method for the identification of the recognized oral veillonella species.

TI  == the predominant cultivable veillonella spp. of the tongue of healthy adults identified using rpob sequencing.
AB  == the predominant veillonella spp. were isolated from the dorsum surface of the tongues of 11 healthy adults and identified to species level using rpob sequencing because 16s ribosomal rna sequence analysis does not reliably differentiate between all members of this genus. in all, 253 isolates were identified and the mean proportion (+/- se) of veillonella spp. per sample was 16.2 (+/- 3.6) with a range of 3.0% to 36.3% of the total anaerobic colony count. the predominant species were veillonella atypica (10/11), veillonella dispar (9/11) and veillonella rogosae (8/11) because they were isolated from the majority of subjects. veillonella parvula was isolated from only one subject while veillonella dentocariosi and veillonella montpelleriensis were not isolated from any subject.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == diversity of veillonella spp. from sound and carious sites in children.
AB  == detailed data on the distribution of veillonella in caries-free and caries-active subjects are scarce. we hypothesized that the diversity of the genus would be lower in caries lesions than in plaque from caries-free individuals. the proportions of veillonella were not significantly different in the two groups. all isolates (n = 1308) were genotyped by rep-pcr, and different genotypes (n = 170) were identified by 16s rrna, dnak, and rpob sequencing. v. parvula, v. dispar, and v. atypica were in both groups, v. denticariosi only in caries lesions, and v. rogosae only from the caries-free individuals (p < 0.009). lesions were more likely to harbor a single predominant species (p = 0.0018). the mean number of genotypes in the lesions was less than in the fissure (p < 0.001)  or buccal (p = 0.011) sites. the veillonella from caries-free sites were more diverse than those from caries lesions, and may be related to the acidic environment of caries lesions.

TI  == molecular identification of the first human isolate belonging to the veillonella  ratti-veillonella criceti group based on 16s rdna and dnak gene sequencing.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative cocci belonging to the genus veillonella are currently subdivided into eight species. among them, four have been isolated either from human flora or from clinical samples during infectious processes: veillonella atypica, v. dispar, v. parvula and v. montpellierensis. to date, the four other species have only been found in animals. in particular, v. ratti and v. criceti,  since their characterization, have been exclusively reported from mouth and intestine of rodents. we report here for the first time a human isolate belonging to the v. ratti-v. criceti group recovered in mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora from  a semen sample in a 24-year-old man attending the urology unit of our hospital for infertility. identification of the isolate was based on 16s ribosomal dna and dnak gene sequencing. since then, two strains of veillonella sp. recovered from semen samples remained unidentified to the species level, and 16s rdna-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that they might represent novel taxa within the genus veillonella. taken together, these observations suggest that host restriction may not exist in the genus veillonella and that bacterial diversity remains underestimated both within this genus and in human semen.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial nitrate reduction in the human oral cavity.
AB  == it is hypothesized that the enterosalivary nitrate circulation encourages nitrate reducing bacteria to reside within the oral cavity. nitrite production may then limit the growth of acidogenic bacteria as a result of the production of antimicrobial oxides of nitrogen, including nitric oxide. this study was carried  out with 10 subjects to characterize oral nitrate reduction and identify the bacteria responsible. nitrate reduction varied between individuals (mean 85.4 +/- 15.9 nmol nitrite min(-1) with 10 ml 1 mm kno(3) mouth wash) and was found to be  concentrated at the rear of the tongue dorsal surface. nitrate reductase positive isolates identified, using 16s rdna sequencing, from the tongue comprised veillonella atypica (34%), veillonella dispar (24%), actinomyces odontolyticus (21%), actinomyces naeslundii (2%), rothia mucilaginosa (10%), rothia dentocariosa (3%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (5%). nitrite production rates,  using intact and permeabilized cells, of the major tongue nitrate reducers were determined in the presence of methyl and benzyl viologen. under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, rates in decreasing order were: a. odontolyticus > r. mucilaginosa > r. dentocariosa > v. dispar > v. atypica. in conclusion, veillonella spp. were found to be the most prevalent taxa isolated and thus may make a major contribution to nitrate reduction in the oral cavity.

TI  == intra-chromosomal heterogeneity between the four 16s rrna gene copies in the genus veillonella: implications for phylogeny and taxonomy.
AB  == among the seven species characterized within the genus veillonella, three (veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula and veillonella atypica) have so far been isolated from human flora and during infectious processes. sequencing and analysis of 16s rdna (rrs) has been described as the best method for identification of veillonella strains at the species level since phenotypic characteristics are unable to differentiate between species. rrs sequencing for the three species isolated from humans showed more than 98 % identity between them. four rrs copies were found in the reference strains and in all the clinical isolates studied. the sequences of each rrs were determined for the clinical strain adv 360.1, and they showed a relatively high level of heterogeneity (1.43  %). in the majority of cases, polymorphic positions corresponded to nucleotides allowing differentiation between the three species isolated from humans. moreover, variability observed between rrs copies was higher than that between 16s rdna sequences of v. parvula and v. dispar. phylogenetic analysis showed that polymorphism between rrs copies affected the position of strain adv 360.1 in the  tree. variable positions occurred in stems and loops belonging to variable and hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna secondary structure but did not change the  overall structure of the 16s rrna. pcr-rflp experiments performed on 27 clinical  isolates of veillonella sp. suggested that inter-rrs heterogeneity occurs widely  among the members of the genus veillonella: these results, together with the lack of phenotypic criteria for species differentiation, give preliminary arguments for unification of v. dispar and v. parvula.

TI  == differentiation of veillonella atypica, veillonella dispar and veillonella parvula using restricted fragment-length polymorphism analysis of 16s rdna amplified by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == veillonella atypica, veillonella dispar and veillonella parvula cannot be reliably distinguished by conventional phenotypic tests, including the api zym test. in this study, restricted fragment-length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of 16s rdna amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to generate restriction profiles of the type strains of v. atypica, v. dispar and v. parvula  and 20 veillonella strains isolated from oral sites. 16s rrna gene sequences from isolated genomic dna samples were amplified by pcr. pcr products were purified and characterized by single digestion with 13 restriction endonucleases. among them, mn/i was found to discriminate the respective reference strains, and the clinical isolates were assigned to one of the three species on the basis of their restriction profiles by digestion with mn/i. thus, rflp analysis of pcr-amplified 16s rdna, using mn/i, is a rapid and reliable method for the differentiation of v. atypica, v. dispar and v. parvula.

TI  == pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of genes coding for 16s rrna in veillonella spp.
AB  == restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of pcr-amplified 16s ribosomal  dna (16s rdna pcr-rflp) was used to generate restriction profiles of the american type culture collection type strains of the genus veillonella, i.e., v. atypica,  v. caviae, v. criceti, v. dispar, v. parvula, v. ratti, and v. rodentium. whole-cell protein profiles were obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for comparative purposes. the 16s rrna genes were amplified by pcr, and rflp analysis of the 16s rdna was performed with mnli and sau3ai. mnli produced six rflp patterns for seven type strains, since the patterns for v. atypica and v. caviae were the same. rflp patterns with sau3ai could distinguish between v. atypica and v. caviae. the type strains of veillonella species were easily distinguished by 16s rdna pcr-rflp.

TI  == coaggregation properties of human oral veillonella spp.: relationship to colonization site and oral ecology.
AB  == the primary habitats of oral veillonellae are the tongue, dental plaque, and the  buccal mucosa. isolates were obtained from each habitat and tested for coaggregation with a battery of other oral bacterial strains. all 59 tongue isolates tested for coaggregation were veillonella atypica or veillonella dispar. all but one of them coaggregated with strains of streptococcus salivarius, a predominant inhabitant of the tongue surface but not subgingival dental plaque. these tongue isolates were unable to coaggregate with most normal members of the  subgingival flora such as actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus sanguis. in contrast, 24 of 29 veillonella isolates, of which 20 were veillonella parvula from subgingival dental plaque samples, coaggregated strongly with the three species of actinomyces, s. sanguis, and other bacteria usually present in subgingival plaque, but they did not coaggregate with s. salivarius. the majority of isolates from the buccal mucosa (42 of 55) has coaggregation properties like those from the tongue. these results indicate that the three human oral veillonella species  are distributed on oral surfaces that are also occupied by their coaggregation partners and thus provide strong evidence that coaggregation plays a critical role in the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.
