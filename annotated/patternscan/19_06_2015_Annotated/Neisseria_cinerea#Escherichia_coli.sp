TI  == functional diversity of three different dsba proteins from neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == the genome of neisseria meningitidis serogroup b strain mc58 contains three genes - nmb0278, nmb0294 and nmb0407 - encoding putative homologues of dsba, a periplasmic thiol disulphide oxidoreductase protein-folding catalyst of the dsb protein family. dsba assists the folding of periplasmic and membrane proteins in  diverse organisms. while all three cloned genes complemented the dtt sensitivity  of dsba-null escherichia coli, they showed different activities in folding specific target proteins in this background. nmb0278 protein was the most active  in complementing defects in motility and alkaline phosphatase activity, while nmb0294 was the most active in folding periplasmic malf. nmb0407 showed the weakest activity in all assays. it is extremely unusual for organisms to contain  more than one chromosomal dsba. among the members of the genus neisseria, only the meningococcus carries all three of these genes. strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria lactamica, neisseria cinerea and neisseria polysaccharea contained only homologues of nmb0278 and nmb0407, while neisseria flava, neisseria subflava and neisseria flavescens carried only nmb0294. it is speculated that the versatility of the meningococcus in surviving in different colonizing and invasive disease settings may be derived in part from an enhanced  potential to deploy outer-membrane proteins, a consequence of carrying an extended repertoire of protein-folding catalysts.

TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == degradation of heme in gram-negative bacteria: the product of the hemo gene of neisseriae is a heme oxygenase.
AB  == a full-length heme oxygenase gene from the gram-negative pathogen neisseria meningitidis was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. expression of the enzyme yielded soluble catalytically active protein and caused accumulation of biliverdin within the e. coli cells. the purified hemo forms a 1:1 complex with heme and has a heme protein spectrum similar to that previously reported for the  purified heme oxygenase (hmuo) from the gram-positive pathogen corynebacterium diphtheriae and for eukaryotic heme oxygenases. the overall sequence identity between hemo and these heme oxygenases is, however, low. in the presence of ascorbate or the human nadph cytochrome p450 reductase system, the heme-hemo complex is converted to ferric-biliverdin ixalpha and carbon monoxide as the final products. homologs of the hemo gene were identified and characterized in six commensal neisseria isolates, neisseria lactamica, neisseria subflava, neisseria flava, neisseria polysacchareae, neisseria kochii, and neisseria cinerea. all hemo orthologs shared between 95 and 98% identity in amino acid sequences with functionally important residues being completely conserved. this is the first heme oxygenase identified in a gram-negative pathogen. the identification of hemo as a heme oxygenase provides further evidence that oxidative cleavage of the heme is the mechanism by which some bacteria acquire iron for further use.

TI  == characterization of the ftsz cell division gene of neisseria gonorrhoeae: expression in escherichia coli and n. gonorrhoeae.
AB  == we cloned the cell division gene ftsz of the gram-negative coccus neisseria gonorrhoeae (ng) strain ch811, characterized it genetically and phenotypically, and studied its localization in n. gonorrhoeae and escherichia coli (ec). the 1,179-bp orf of ftsz(ng) encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 41.5 kda. protein sequence alignments indicate that ftsz(ng) is similar to other  ftsz proteins and contains the conserved gtp binding motif. ftsz homologues were  identified in several n. gonorrhoeae strains and in neisseria lactamica, neisseria sicca, neisseria polysaccharae and neisseria cinerea either by western  blot or by pcr-southern blot analysis. attempts to inactivate the ftsz(ng) on the chromosome failed, indicating that it is essential for gonococcal growth. ftsz(ng) was synthesized in an in vitro transcription/translation system and was  shown to be 43 kda, the same size as in western blots. expression of the ftsz(ng) gene from nongonococcal promoters resulted in a filamentous phenotype in e. coli. under controlled expression, the ftsz(ng)-gfp fusion protein localized at the mid-cell division site in e. coli. e. coli expressing high levels of the ftsz(ng)-gfp fusion protein formed filaments and exhibited different fluorescent  structures including helices, spiral tubules extending from pole to pole, and regularly spaced dots or bands that did not localize at the middle of the cell. expression of the ftsz(ng)-gfp fusion protein in n. gonorrhoeae resulted in abnormal cell division as shown by electron microscopy. ftsz(ng)-gfp fusions were also expressed in a gonococcal background using a unique shuttle vector.

TI  == cd66-mediated phagocytosis of opa52 neisseria gonorrhoeae requires a src-like tyrosine kinase- and rac1-dependent signalling pathway.
AB  == the interaction of neisseria gonorrhoeae with human phagocytes is a hallmark of gonococcal infections. recently, cd66 molecules have been characterized as receptors for opa52-expressing gonococci on human neutrophils. here we show that  opa52-expressing gonococci or escherichia coli or f(ab) fragments directed against cd66, respectively, activate a signalling cascade from cd66 via src-like  protein tyrosine kinases, rac1 and pak to jun-n-terminal kinase. the induced signal is distinct from fcgamma-receptor-mediated signalling and is specific for  opa52, since piliated opa- gonococci, commensal neisseria cinerea or e.coli do not stimulate this signalling pathway. inhibition of src-like kinases or rac1 prevents the uptake of opa52 bacteria, demonstrating the crucial role of this signalling cascade for the opsonin-independent, opa52/cd66-mediated phagocytosis  of pathogenic neisseria.

TI  == sequence diversity within the argf, fbp and reca genes of natural isolates of neisseria meningitidis: interspecies recombination within the argf gene.
AB  == studies of natural populations of neisseria meningitidis using multilocus enzyme  electrophoresis have shown extensive genetic variation within this species, which, it has been proposed, implies a level of sequence diversity within meningococci that is greater than that normally considered as the criterion for species limits in bacteria. to obtain a direct measure of the sequence diversity  among meningococci, we obtained the nucleotide sequences of most of the argf, reca and fbp genes of eight meningococci of widely differing electrophoretic type (from the reference collection of caugant). sequence variation between the meningococcal strains ranged from 0-0.6% for fbp, 0-1.3% for argf, and 0-3.3% for reca. these levels of diversity are no greater than those found within escherichia coli 'housekeeping' genes and suggest that multilocus enzyme electrophoresis may overestimate the extent of nucleotide sequence diversity within meningococci. the average sequence divergence between the neisseria meningitidis strains and n. gonorrhoeae strain fa19 was 1.0% for fbp and 1.6% for reca. the argf gene, although very uniform among the eight meningococcal isolates, had a striking mosaic structure when compared with the gonococcal argf  gene: two regions of the gene differed by greater than 13% in nucleotide sequence between meningococci and gonococci, whereas the rest of the gene differed by less than 1.7%. one of the diverged regions was shown to have been introduced from the argf gene of a commensal neisseria species that is closely related to neisseria cinerea. the source of the other region was unclear.

TI  == role of outer-membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide in conjugation between neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria cinerea.
AB  == little is known concerning the mechanism involved in cell contact between the donor and recipient during conjugation in neisseria gonorrhoeae. the formation of stable mating pairs during conjugation in escherichia coli appears to require a specific protein as well as lps in the outer membrane of the recipient cell. to attempt to identify the cell surface components necessary for conjugation in the  neisseriae, we began a comparison of the outer membrane of neisseria cinerea strains that can (con+) and cannot (con-) serve as recipients in conjugation with n. gonorrhoeae. there were no differences in outer-membrane protein profiles on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis between con+ and con- strains that could be correlated with the ability to conjugate. however, whole outer membrane isolated from con+ strains specifically inhibited conjugation while those from con- strains did not. proteolytic cleavage of outer-membrane proteins by trypsin, pronase or alpha-chymotrypsin abolished the inhibitory effect of con+ outer membranes, suggesting that these outer membranes contained a protease-sensitive protein(s) involved in conjugation. although periodate oxidation of con+ outer-membrane carbohydrates did not abolish the inhibitory action of these membranes, purified lps from both con+ and con- strains inhibited conjugation when added at low concentrations. these results suggest that conjugation requires the presence of a specific conjugal receptor that consists of both lps and one or more outer-membrane proteins. both con+ and con- strains contain the necessary lps, but only con+ strains contain the required protein(s).

TI  == transfer of a gonococcal beta-lactamase plasmid to conjugation-deficient neisseria cinerea strains by transformation.
AB  == we have previously shown that some strains of neisseria cinerea can serve as recipients in conjugation (con+) with neisseria gonorrhoeae while others cannot (con-). to determine if a replication defect contributes to the inability of certain strains of n. cinerea to serve as recipients in conjugation, we attempted to introduce a naturally occurring gonococcal beta-lactamase plasmid into n. cinerea by transformation. various methods were employed, and all proved unsuccessful. since specific sequences are required for dna uptake in transformation of n. gonorrhoeae, we constructed a number of hybrid plasmids containing n. cinerea chromosomal dna inserted into the n. gonorrhoeae/escherichia coli beta-lactamase shuttle vector, ples2. when nine randomly selected plasmids with inserts were used to transform an n. cinerea strain which did not accept the gonococcal beta-lactamase plasmid by conjugation, transformants were observed with four of the hybrid plasmids. the presence of one of the hybrid plasmids, pcag9, in transformants was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, southern hybridization, and beta-lactamase production. when an n. gonorrhoeae donor strain containing pcag9 was used in conjugation with several n. cinerea strains, only those strains that were previously shown to act as recipients could accept and maintain pcag9. the ability of pcag9 and the other three hybrid plasmids to transform con- strains demonstrates that the beta-lactamase plasmid can replicate in con- strains, and, therefore, the con- phenotype is due to a block in some other stage of the conjugation process.
