TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of streptococcus suis.
AB  == in our continued effort to search for a streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of s. suis type 2. a clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized  within a 2.0-kbp ecori dna fragment. the nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kda. by in vitro protein synthesis and western  blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kda. at the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from streptococcus pneumoniae (89%),  streptococcus mutans (86%), lactococcus lactis (80%), listeria monocytogenes (74%), and clostridium perfringens (64%). except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in  strains of other s. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the ecori recognition sequence. we confirmed expression of the 38-kda protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. the recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of s. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most s. suis infections. pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kda protein mounted antibody responses to  the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of s. suis type 2, suggesting  that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against s. suis infection. analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. the functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic s. suis capsular  types remains to be determined.

TI  == genetic characterisation of the botulinum toxin complex of clostridium botulinum  strain nctc 2916.
AB  == an 8 kb segment of the clostridium botulinum nctc 2916 genome 5' to the type a botulinum neurotoxin gene has been sequenced revealing five open reading frames.  four encode components (ha70, ha17, ha34 and ntnh/a) of the progenitor toxin complex. the product of the fifth, orfx, possesses a putative c-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, exhibits homology with known regulatory proteins (including msmr from streptococcus mutans, uvia from c. perfringens and orftxe1 located upstream of the c. difficile toxin b gene) and is also found within the vicinity of genes encoding tetanus toxin and types b, c, d and g botulinum toxins. primer extension and northern blotting analysis demonstrates that the genes are expressed as two divergent operons [ha34, ha17, ha70] and [ntnh/a, type a toxin gene], with the orfx gene expressed singly. immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start sites of the ha34 and ntnh/a genes are two highly conserved motifs (5'-attttaggtttacaaaa-3' and 5'-atgttatatgtaa-3'), separated by 12 bp, that span the putative -35 and -10 promoter regions. homologous sequences occur in the equivalent position relative to the genes at type c botulinum toxin gene and the tetanus toxin gene loci. it is likely that these sequence motifs, together with orfx, are involved in the co-ordinate expression of the genes encoding the various components of the botulinum toxin complex in groups i, iii and iv c. botulinum strains and in that of the tetanus toxin gene.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of  a specific wavelength. hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. this investigation assessed the effect of light-activated hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. light-activated hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus m-g intermedius, streptococcus mutans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, and clostridium perfringens, but did not affect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans. photoactivation of hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. combinations of light-activated hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular s. aureus. the ability of hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the  treatment of abscesses.
