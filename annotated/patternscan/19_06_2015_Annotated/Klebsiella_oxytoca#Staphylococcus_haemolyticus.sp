TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == [bacterial causes of meningitis in newborns].
AB  == introduction: bacterial meningitis jeopardizes the life of affected newborns and  in survived children often leaves permanent sequels. the sooner the diagnosis is  established and the therapy is started, the more a prosperous outcome can be expected. when the indication is established, lumbar punction should be performed. on the basis of the results of cytological and biochemical analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) that point to bacterial meningitis, the initial therapy should begin even before the results of bacteriological analyses. it is important to know which causes are to be expected in order to make an adequate choice of antibiotics for initial therapy. the aim of this study is to identify the causes of meningitis, frequency of their occurrings and mortality-rate in the affected newborns. patients and methods: a prospective study was carried out in the paediatric department of the institute from january 1, 1978 to december 31, 2000. patients originated from all parts of yugoslavia. after the establishing of indication, lumbar punction was performed. csf was sent to cytological, biochemical and bacteriological analyses. diagnosis of meningitis was established when at least two criteria of four were fulfilled: 1. isolation of the cause by csf culture; 2. elevation of csf leukocyte count more than 20 with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 3. hypoglucorrhachia (glycaemia less than 40 mg  percent or less than 50 percent of glycaemia); 4. identification of bacteria by the gram stain of csf sediment. in 173 newborns the cause of bacterial meningitis was confirmed. results and discussion: causes of meningitis were as follows: e. coli in 46 newborns (n) (26.5%), streptococcus b haemolyticus group b in 35 n (20.2%), k. pneumoniae in 27 n (15.6%), k. oxytoca in 3 n (1.7%), proteus spp in  14 n (8%), salmonella spp in 12 n, pseudomonas spp in 9 n, streptococcus pneumoniae in 9 n, acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 4 n, enterobacter spp in 3 n, l. monocytogenes and serratia marcescens and staphylococcus aureus in 2 n each, and in one n. meningitidis, streptococcus group d, citrobacter, morganella morganii and alkaligenes xilosoxidans. over the period 1978-1987, the most frequent causes were: e. coli (28.2%), sbhb (26.8%) and klebsiella spp (11.3%). over the period 1991-2000, order and frequency of causes had been changed: klebsiella spp (26.8%), e. coli (19.2%), sbhb (14.1%), etc. in addition, new causes appeared, namely: morganella morganii, citrobacter, k. oxitoca and alkaligenes xylosoxidans (table 2). of a total of 173 patients, 52 (30.1%) died:  of 124 children with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria, 39 (31.4%) died, and of 49 children with gram-positive bacteria, 13 (26.5%) died (table 1).  comparing the first and the last decade, mortality decreased by only 0.2% (table  2). the explanation might be that the patients came to the institute too late, and after manifestation of resistant and multiresistant causes that obscured the  appropriate selection of antibiotics for initial therapy. the precious time between the onset of the disease and start of the therapy was lost in this way. newborns with bacterial meningitis should be treated only in health institutions  where the intensive care units for newborns exist. conclusion: the most frequent  causes of meningitis are the following: e. coli, sbhb and klebsiella pn. frequency of causes of meningitis changed with time. new uncommon causes have appeared. the mortality-rate remained very high.

TI  == [prostate histopathology of nih category iv prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == residual bacterial contamination on reusable pulse oximetry sensors.
AB  == background: an early study demonstrated that standard cleaning techniques did not adequately disinfect reusable pulse oximetry sensors that had been intentionally  contaminated with high titers of pathogenic microorganisms. this current study evaluated patient-ready sensors being used in hospitals, by testing them for bacterial contamination. methods: reusable pulse oximetry sensors from 15 hospitals throughout the united states were tested. each sensor was deemed by the hospital to be ready for patient use, and it had been prepared for use according  to hospital procedures. patient-contact areas of each sensor were swabbed, and the swabs were analyzed for bacterial contamination using standard testing procedures. this study had two stages, and different sensors were tested in each  stage. in the "bacterial-growth stage," swabs were evaluated for bacterial contamination but organisms were not identified; in the "identification stage," bacterial species were identified. results: forty-four sensors were evaluated, 16 in the bacterial-growth stage and 28 in the identification stage. bacteria were cultured from 29 of the 44 sensors (66%), including 20 that had been cleaned with alcohol or an antibacterial/antiviral agent. among the isolated organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, and klebsiella oxytoca. bacterial contamination was found on sensors from 12 of the 15 participating hospitals. conclusions: these data demonstrate the need to define effective cleaning methods for reusable sensors, and we are currently conducting such studies. the data also suggest that disposable patient-dedicated  sensors may be the most appropriate choice when infection control is of particular concern.
