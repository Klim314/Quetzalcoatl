TI  == skin and soft-tissue infections caused by aeromonas species.
AB  == this study investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) due to aeromonas species. patients with sstis caused by aeromonas species during the period from january 2009 to december 2011  were identified from a computerized database of a regional hospital in southern taiwan. the medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. a total of 129 patients with sstis due to aeromonas species were identified. a. hydrophila (n = 77, 59.7 %) was the most common pathogen, followed by a. veronii  biovar sobria (n = 22, 17.1 %), a. veronii biovar veronii (n = 20, 15.5 %), a. caviae (n = 9, 7.0 %), and a. schubertii (n = 1, 0.8 %). the most common isolates obtained from patients with polymicrobial infections were klebsiella species (n = 33), followed by enterococcus spp. (n = 24), enterobacter spp. (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 17), staphylococcus spp. (n = 17), streptococcus spp. (n =  17), and acinetobacter spp. (n = 15). liver cirrhosis and concomitant bacteremia  were more common among patients with monomicrobial aeromonas sstis than among patients with polymicrobial sstis. nine (7 %) patients required limb amputations. the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.6 %. in conclusion, aeromonas species should be considered as important causative pathogens of sstis, and most infections are  polymicrobial. in addition, the clinical presentation differs markedly between patients with monomicrobial and those with polymicrobial aeromonas sstis.

TI  == microbiology of the external ear canal in six african elephants (loxodonta africana).
AB  == samples collected from both external ear canals of six adult female african elephants (loxodonta africana) were cultured for fungi, yeasts and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. all the samples produced heavy growths of several aerobic bacteria, but anaerobic bacteria were rare and no fungi or yeasts were isolated.  the most common bacterium isolated was staphylococcus epidermidis, which was cultured from 11 of the 12 ears. acinetobacter calcoaceticus lwoffi, alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and corynebacterium species, and aeromonas caviae  were all isolated from at least six of the 12 ears.

TI  == the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase of aeromonas caviae st exhibits nadh-dependent tellurite reductase activity.
AB  == potassium tellurite (k(2)teo(3)) is extremely toxic for most forms of life and only a limited number of organisms are naturally resistant to the toxic effects of this compound. crude extracts prepared from the environmental isolate aeromonas caviae st catalize the in vitro reduction of teo32- in a nadh-dependent reaction. upon fractionation by ionic exchange column chromatography three major  polypeptides identified as the e1, e2, and e3 components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (pdh) complex were identified in fractions exhibiting tellurite-reducing activity. tellurite reductase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities co-eluted from a sephadex gel filtration column. to determine which component(s) of the pdh complex has tellurite reductase activity, the a. caviae st structural genes encoding for e1 (acee), e2 (acef), and e3 (lpda) were independently cloned and expressed in escherichia coli and their gene products purified. results indicated that tellurite reductase activity lies almost exclusively in the e3 component, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. the e3 component of the pdh complex from e. coli, zymomonas mobilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and geobacillus stearothermophilus also showed nadh-dependent tellurite reductase in  vitro suggesting that this enzymatic activity is widely distributed among microorganisms.

TI  == bacteriocin-like substance (bls) production in aeromonas hydrophila water isolates.
AB  == 30 aeromonas hydrophila water isolates were tested for bacteriocin-like substance (bls) production using a target panel of closely related microorganisms and other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. a. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity against one or more indicator microorganisms, but the activity emerged only with non-phylogenetically related genera or species. in particular all a. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity  against one or more of the tested staphylococcus strains, five against listeria spp. (listeria seeligeri, listeria welshimeri and listeria ivanovii), and eight presented a weak antagonistic activity towards streptococcus agalactiae and lactobacillus spp. inhibitory activity was not observed against the other gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua and enterococcus spp.) and gram-negative tested strains, including aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae and the same a. hydrophila, when used as indicator. anti-staphylococcal activity  was observed with a gradual increase of the inhibition zone during incubation and seemed to be influenced by a. hydrophila hemolytic expression. extrachromosomal analysis showed the presence, in 70% of the strains, of one to five plasmids with molecular masses ranging from 2.1 to 41.5 mda, but it was not possible to relate  this result with bls production.

TI  == cleavage of influenza a virus h1 hemagglutinin by swine respiratory bacterial proteases.
AB  == cleavage of influenza a virus hemagglutinin (ha) is required for expression of fusion activity and virus entry into cells. extracellular proteases are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage activation of avirulent avian and mammalian influenza viruses and contribute to pathogenicity and tissue tropism. the relative contributions of host and microbial proteases to cleavage activation in natural infection remain to be established. we examined 23 respiratory bacterial pathogens and 150 aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from the nasal cavities of pigs for proteolytic activity. no evidence of secreted proteases was  found for the bacterial pathogens, including haemophilus parasuis, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, and streptococcus suis. proteolytic bacteria were isolated from 7 of 11 swine nasal samples and included staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus hyicus, aeromonas caviae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and enterococcus sp. only p. aeruginosa secreted a protease, elastase, that cleaved influenza virus ha. however, compared to trypsin, the site of cleavage by elastase was shifted one amino acid in the carboxy-terminal direction and resulted in inactivation of the virus. under the conditions of this study, we identified several bacterial isolates from the respiratory tracts of pigs that secrete proteases in vitro. however, none of these proteolytic isolates demonstrated direct cleavage activation of influenza virus ha.

TI  == [camp factor for the differentiation among aeromonas species].
AB  == the camp factor technique, described by natale figura as a presumptive method for the differentiation of the species hydrophila, sobria and caviae, was applied to  80 aeromonas strains isolated from children under 5 years with acute diarrheic disease. the typical phenomenon was seen in aerobiosis and anaerobiosis conditions in 10 strains, which were classified as aeromonas hydrophila. in aerobiosis conditions/alone, it was observed in 20 strains, which were identified as aeromonas sobria. it was not observed in either of the incubation conditions above mentioned in 50 of the remaining strains, which were identified as aeromonas caviae. the advantages of applying this new technique is emphasized.

TI  == differentiation of motile and mesophilic aeromonas strains into species by testing for a camp-like factor.
AB  == motile and mesophilic aeromonas strains can presumptively be differentiated into  species in 18 to 24 h by testing the isolates for the production of a camp-like factor. aeromonas hydrophila strains were positive either aerobically or anaerobically, aeromonas sobria strains were positive only aerobically, and aeromonas caviae strains were always negative.
