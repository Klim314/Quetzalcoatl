TI  == classification of swiss cheese starter and adjunct cultures using fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy.
AB  == the acceptability of swiss cheese largely depends on the flavor profile, and strain variations of cheese cultures will affect the final quality. conventional  biochemical methods to identify the cultures at the strain level are time-consuming and expensive, and require skilled labor. our objective was to develop rapid classification methods of starter cultures at the strain level by using a combination of hydrophobic grid membrane filters and fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy. forty-four pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-verified strains of starter and nonstarter cultures including streptococcus thermophilus, propionibacterium freudenreichii, and lactobacillus spp. were analyzed. the strains were grown on their respective agar media, transferred to broth media, and incubated. then, cultures were centrifuged and the pellets were resuspended in saline solution (10 mul). aliquots (2 mul) of the suspended bacterial solution were placed onto a grid of the hydrophobic grid membrane filters, having 6 grids per each strain analyzed. the dried filters were read by ftir microspectroscopy fitted with an attenuated total reflectance probe. collected spectra were statistically analyzed by a soft independent modeling of class analogy (simca) for pattern recognition. classification models were developed for streptococcus thermophilus, propionibacterium freudenreichii, and lactobacillus spp. strains. the models showed major discrimination in the spectral region from 1,200 to 900 cm(-1) associated with signals from phosphate-containing compounds and various polysaccharides in the cell wall. the  developed method allowed for rapid classification of several swiss cheese starter and nonstarter cultures at the strain level. this information provides a detailed overview of microbiological status, which would enable corrective measures to be  taken early in the cheese making process, limiting production of inferior quality cheese and minimizing defects. this method could be an effective tool to identify and monitor activity of cheese and other dairy starter cultures.

TI  == specific metabolic activity of ripening bacteria quantified by real-time reverse  transcription pcr throughout emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == bacterial communities of fermented foods are usually investigated by culture-dependent methods. real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) and reverse transcription (rt)-qpcr offer new possibilities to quantify the populations present and their metabolic activity. the aim of this work was to develop qpcr and rt-qpcr methods to assess the metabolic activity and the stress level of the  two species used as ripening cultures in emmental cheese manufacture, propionibacterium freudenreichii and lactobacillus paracasei. three small scale (1/100) microbiologically controlled emmental cheeses batches were manufactured and inoculated with lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei. at 12 steps of cheese manufacture and ripening,  the populations of p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei were quantified by numerations on agar media and by qpcr. 16s, tuf and grol transcript levels were quantified by rt-qpcr. sampling was carried out in triplicate. qpcr and rt-qpcr assessments were specific, efficient and linear. the quantification limit was 10(3) copies of cells or cdna/g of cheese. cell quantifications obtained by qpcr  gave similar results than plate count for p. freudenreichii growth and 0.5 to 1 log lower in the stationary phase. bacterial counts and qpcr quantifications showed that l. paracasei began to grow during the pressing step while p. freudenreichii began to grow from the beginning of ripening (in the cold room). tuf cdna quantification results suggested that metabolic activity of l. paracasei reached a maximum during the first part of the ripening (in cold room) and decreased progressively during ripening (in the warm room). metabolic activity of p. freudenreichii was maximum at the end of cold ripening room and was stable during the first two weeks in warm room. after lactate exhaustion (after two weeks of warm room), the number of tuf cdna decreased reflecting reduced metabolic activity. for l. paracasei, grol cdna were stable during ripening. for  p. freudenreichii, grol1 gene was highly-expressed during acidification, while grol2 gene highly expression was only observed at the end of the ripening stage after lactate (carbon substrate of p. freudenreichii) exhaustion. the potential use of 16s and tuf genes for the normalization of cdna quantification throughout  an emmental cheese manufacture is discussed. for the first time, specific gene expression was performed by rt-qpcr yielding metabolic activity and stress response evaluation for l. paracasei and p. freudenreichii in cheese.

TI  == effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of supplemented copper (cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture. methods and results: thirteen strains belonging to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus or propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various  copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and ph measurements, also by platings. among the species considered, l. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and s. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. anaerobic conditions  increased this sensitivity significantly. there was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. conclusions: copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. in addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for emmental cheese manufacture.

TI  == capsular exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene of propionibacterium freudenreichii  subsp. shermanii.
AB  == in the dairy industry, exopolysaccharides (eps) contribute to improving the texture and viscosity of cheese and yoghurt and also receive increasing attention because of their beneficial properties for health. for lactic acid bacteria, the  production of eps is well studied. however, for dairy propionibacteria the biosynthesis of eps is poorly documented. a polysaccharide synthase-encoding gene was identified in the genome of propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii tl 34 (cip 103027). this gene best aligns with tts, the polysaccharide synthase gene of streptococcus pneumoniae type 37 that is responsible for the production of a beta-glucan capsular polysaccharide. pcr amplification showed the presence of an internal fragment of this gene in twelve strains of p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii with a ropy phenotype in yel+ medium. the gene sequence is highly conserved, as less than 1% of nucleotides differed among the 10 strains containing the complete gtf gene. the same primers failed to detect the gene in propionibacterium acidipropionici strain tl 47, which is known to excrete exopolysaccharides in milk. the presence of (1-->3, 1-->2)-beta-d-glucan capsule  was demonstrated for 7 out of 12 strains by agglutination with a s. pneumoniae-type 37-specific antiserum. the presence of mrna corresponding to the  gene was detected by rt-pcr in three strains at both exponential and stationary growth phases. this work represents the first identification of a polysaccharide  synthase gene of p. freudenreichii, and further studies will be undertaken to elucidate the role of capsular eps.

TI  == treatment of acute otitis media with probiotics in otitis-prone children-a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study.
AB  == background & aims: to examine whether probiotics would reduce the occurrence or duration of acute otitis media (aom), or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. methods: during this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week intervention, 309 otitis-prone children (10 months-6 years) consumed either one probiotic capsule (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii js) (n=155) or placebo (n=154) daily. clinical examinations were carried out and nasopharyngeal samples taken three times. parents recorded the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (uri) in a diary. results: probiotic treatment did not reduce the occurrence (probiotic vs. placebo: 72% vs. 65%, or=1.48, 95% ci 0.87-2.52, p=n.s.) or the recurrence ( three) of aom episodes (18% vs. 17%, or=1.04, 95% ci 0.55-1.96, p=n.s.). the median duration of aom episodes was 5.6 (iqr 3.5-9.4) vs. 6.0 (iqr 4.0-10.5) days, respectively (p= n.s.). there was a tendency showing a reduction in the occurrence of recurrent (4 to 6) respiratory infections in the probiotic group (or for 4 uris: 0.56, 95%ci 0.31-0.99, p=0.046; or for 6 uris: 0.59, 95% ci 0.34 to 1.03, p=n.s.). probiotics did not affect the carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae, but increased the prevalence of moraxella catarrhalis (or=1.79, 95% ci 1.06-3.00, p=0.028). conclusions: probiotics did not prevent the occurrence of aom or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children.  a tendency showing a reduction in recurrent respiratory infections must be confirmed in further studies.

TI  == conjugated linoleic acid content and organoleptic attributes of fermented milk products produced with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (cla), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. four probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus rhamnosus, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and p. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures  (lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus). the lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. l. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of cla. growth and cla formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed  with yogurt cultures. the fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor  as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.

TI  == survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  == during the ripening of emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. in emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters  like lactobacillus helveticus, lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as propionibacterium freudenreichii. the aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a  reference map. a methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of  cheese matrix prior to 2d-page analysis. the aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) dna and rna repair and (v) oxidoreduction. the results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria  and propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. different peptidases arose from st thermophilus and lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.

TI  == genetic diversity in swiss cheese starter cultures assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and arbitrarily primed pcr.
AB  == aims: to assess intraspecific genetic heterogeneity among commercial swiss cheese starter culture strains of lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus and propionibacterium freudenreichii and to compare the efficacy of two genetic typing methods. methods and results: two genetic typing methods, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr), were used. nine strep. thermophilus strains revealed eight pfge and five ap-pcr genotypes. seventeen lactobacillus strains yielded 16 and five genotypes by pfge and ap-pcr, respectively. eleven propionibacterium strains yielded 10 pfge genotypes. cluster analysis of pfge profiles generated similarity coefficients for strep. thermophilus, lact. helveticus and prop. freudenreichii strains of 29.5%, 60.3%,  and 30.5%, respectively. milk acidification rates for strep. thermophilus and lact. helveticus were determined. conclusions: pulsed field gel electrophoresis is more discriminatory than ap-pcr. the lact. helveticus group is more homogeneous than the other species examined. strains with > 87% similarity by pfge consistently had the same acidification rate and ap-pcr profile. significance and impact of the study: bacterial strains sold for swiss cheese manufacture in the united states are genetically diverse. clustering of genetically related bacteria may be useful in identifying new strains with industrially relevant traits.

TI  == autolysis and related proteolysis in swiss cheese for two lactobacillus helveticus strains.
AB  == intracellular peptidases of lactobacillus helveticus may play a major role in the proteolysis of swiss cheeses, provided that they are released through bacterial lysis. experimental swiss cheeses were manufactured on a small scale from thermized and microfiltered milk using as starters (in addition to streptococcus  thermophilus and propionibacterium freudenreichii) one of two lb. helveticus strains, itglh1 and itglh77, which undergo lysis to different extents in vitro. all the cheeses were biochemically identical after pressing. the viability of lb. helveticus itglh1 and itglh77 decreased to a similar extent (96-98%) while in the cold room, but the concomitant release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase in  cheeses made with strain itglh1 was 5-7-fold that in cheeses made with itglh77. protein profiles and immunoblot detection of the dipeptidase pepd confirmed a greater degree of lysis of the itglh1 strain. free active peptidases were detected in aqueous extracts of cheese for both strains, and proteolysis occurred principally in the warm room. reversed-phase hplc revealed a more extensive peptide hydrolysis for itglh1, which was confirmed by the greater release of free nh2 groups (+33%) and free amino acids (+75%) compared with itglh77. as the intracellular peptidase activities of itglh1 and itglh77 have previously been shown to be similar, our results indicated that the extent of lysis of lb. helveticus could have a direct impact on the degree of proteolysis in swiss cheeses.

TI  == biochemical properties of streptococcus macedonicus strains isolated from greek kasseri cheese.
AB  == a total of 32 streptococcus macedonicus strains, isolated from greek kasseri cheese, were screened for biochemical properties of technological importance in milk fermentation processing, such as acid production, proteolytic and lipolytic  activity, citrate metabolism, exopolysaccharide production, antimicrobial activity and biogenic amines production. all strains were found to be moderate acidifiers in milk. only four strains could hydrolyse milk casein, while 11 strains showed lipolytic activity against tributyrin. using amino acid derivatives of 4-nitroaniline as substrates, the highest peptidase activities were determined against phenylalanine- and glycine-proline-4-nitroanilide. using  fatty acid derivatives of 4-nitrophenol, it was shown that all strains exhibited  esterase activities up to caprylate, with highest values against butyrate and caproate. only one showed activity up to palmitate; this was also the most active strain against tributyrin. five of the 32 strains could metabolize citrate but none of them produced exopolysaccharides. nine strains displayed antimicrobial activity towards clostridium tyrobutyricum, while no antimicrobial activity was detected against listeria innocua and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. finally, none was able to decarboxylize ornithine, histidine or lysine, and only four strains produced tyramine from tyrosine.

TI  == production of conjugated linoleic acid by dairy starter cultures.
AB  == nineteen different strains of lactobacilli, lactococci, streptococci and propionibacteria commonly used as dairy starter cultures were tested for their ability to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) from free linoleic acid in vitro. two strains of propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. freudenreichii and one strain of p. freudenreichii ssp. sheramnii were found to be capable of converting free linoleic acid to extracellular cla. the highest level of cla formed in the media was 265 micrograms ml-1. of the different isomers, cis- and trans-9,11-octadecadienoic acid represented more than 70% of the total cla formed. the inhibitory effect of linoleic acid on the growth of the bacteria and  its conversion to cla in different media by propionibacteria are discussed.

TI  == ischaemic mouse thigh model for evaluation of pathogenicity of non-clostridial anaerobes.
AB  == a mouse thigh model has been devised in which the growing culture of non-clostridial anaerobe in the ischaemic tissue produces inflammatory swelling and death. the swelling of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of bifidobacterium infantis. actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. mortality and thigh swelling were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of fusobacterium gonidiaformans and propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in acidaminococcus fermentans. high (less than 75%) rate of thigh swelling was also  encountered in case of bacteroides oralis, bacteroides corrodens, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium plauti, peptococcus prevotii, streptococcus intermedius, eubacterium lentum and propionibacterium freudenreichii ss. shermanii.
