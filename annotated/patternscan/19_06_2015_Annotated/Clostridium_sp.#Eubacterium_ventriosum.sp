TI  == shifts in microbiota species and fermentation products in a dietary model enriched in fat and sucrose.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract harbours a 'superorganism' called the gut microbiota,  which is known to play a crucial role in the onset and development of diverse diseases. this internal ecosystem, far from being a static environment, can be manipulated by diet and dietary components. feeding animals with high-fat sucrose (hfs) diets entails diet-induced obesity, a model which is usually used in research to mimic the obese phenotype of western societies. the aim of the present study was to identify gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated metabolic changes produced in male wistar rats fed a hfs diet for 6 weeks and compare it with the basal microbial composition. for this purpose, dna extracted from faeces at baseline and after treatment was analysed by amplification of the v4-v6 region of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) gene using 454 pyrosequencing. short-chain fatty  acids, i.e. acetate, propionate and butyrate, were also evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. at the end of the treatment, gut microbiota composition significantly differed at phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes and proteobacteria) and class level (erisypelotrichi, deltaproteobacteria, bacteroidia and bacilli). interestingly, the class clostridia showed a significant decrease after hfs diet treatment, which correlated with visceral adipose tissue, and is likely mediated by dietary carbohydrates. of particular interest, clostridium cluster xiva species were significantly reduced and changes were identified in the relative abundance of other specific bacterial species (mitsuokella jalaludinii, eubacterium ventriosum, clostridium sp. fcb90-3, prevotella nanceiensis, clostridium fusiformis, clostridium sp. bnl1100 and eubacterium cylindroides) that, in some cases, showed opposite trends to their relative families. these results highlight the relevance of characterising gut microbial population differences at species level and contribute to understand the plausible link between diet and specific gut bacterial species that are able  to influence the inflammatory status, intestinal barrier function and obesity development.

TI  == diversity and abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences in forestomach of alpacas (lama pacos) and sheep (ovis aries).
AB  == two bacterial 16s rrna gene clone libraries were constructed from the forestomach of alpacas and sheep fed alfalfa. after the amplification using the universal 16s rrna gene primers, equal quantities of pcr products from the same species were mixed and used to construct the two libraries. sequence analysis showed that the  60 clones from alpacas were divided into 27 phylotypes with 25% clones affiliated with eubacterium sp. f1. the 60 clones from sheep were divided into 21 phylotypes with 7 phylotypes affiliated with prevotella ruminicola (40% clones). clones closely related to clostridium proteoclasticum, eubacterium sp. f1, clostridium cellobioparum, mogibacterium neglectum, eubacterium ventriosum, clostridiaceae bacterium wn011, clostridium coccoides, clostridium orbiscindens, eubacterium sp. f1, cytophaga sp. dex80-37, treponema bryantii and pelotomaculum sp. fp were only found in the forestomach of alpacas, and those to anaerovorax odorimutans, treponema zioleckii, bifidobacterium indicum, paludibacter propionicigenes, paraprevotella clara, eubacterium siraeum, desulfotomaculum sp. cyp1, clostridium bolteae, clostridium termitidis and clostridiaceae bacterium djf_ls40 only in the rumen of sheep. quantitative real-time pcr revealed that the forestomach of alpacas had significantly lower density of bacteria, with bacterial 16s rrna gene copies (6.89 [log10 (copies per gram of wet weight)]), than that of sheep (7.71,  p<0.01). the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon index (library from alpacas 3.30 and from sheep 3.04). our results showed that there were apparent differences in the bacterial diversity and abundance in the forestomach between alpacas and sheep.

TI  == analysis of the large bowel microbiota of colitic mice using pcr/dgge.
AB  == aim: to test combined polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s rrna gene sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr/dgge) as an analytical method to investigate the composition of the large bowel microbiota of mice during the development of colitis. methods and results: the colonic microbiota of formerly germfree interleukin 10 (il-10)-deficient mice that had been exposed to  the faecal microbiota of specific pathogen-free animals was screened using pcr/dgge. the composition of the large bowel microbiota of il-10-deficient mice changed as colitis progressed. dna fragments originating from four bacterial populations ('bacteroides sp.', bifidobacterium animalis, clostridium cocleatum,  enterococci) were more apparent in pcr/dgge profiles of colitic mice relative to  non-colitic animals, whereas two populations were less apparent (eubacterium ventriosum, acidophilus group lactobacilli). specific dna:rna dot blot analysis showed that bifidobacterial ribosomal rna (rrna) abundance increased as colitis developed. conclusions: pcr/dgge was shown to be an effective method to demonstrate changes in the composition of the large bowel microbiota of mice in relation to progression of inflammatory disease. the intensity of staining of dna fragments in dgge profiles reflected increased abundance of bifidobacterial rrna  in the microbiota of colitic animals. as bifidobacterial fragments in pcr/dgge profiles generated from microbiota dna showed increased intensity of fragment staining, an increase in bifidobacterial numbers in colitic mice was indicated. significance and impact of the study: pcr/dgge analysis demonstrated an altered composition of the large bowel microbiota of colitic mice. this work will allow specific groups of bacteria to be targeted in future research concerning the pathogenesis of colitis.
