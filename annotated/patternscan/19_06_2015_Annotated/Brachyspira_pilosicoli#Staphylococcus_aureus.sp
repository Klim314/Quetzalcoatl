TI  == brachyspira (serpulina) pilosicoli of human origin interfere with the haemolytic  activity and the growth of staphylococcus aureus beta-toxin producer.
AB  == brachyspira (serpulina) pilosicoli related to intestinal spirochaetosis were found to interfere in vitro with the haemolytic activity and the growth of staphylococcus aureus beta-toxin producer. this interference was clearly appreciated because a reduction of the zone of the staphylococcal beta-toxin activity, the reduction and/or absence of cooperative haemolysis between bacteria, and the growth reduction of s. aureus were observed when b. (s.) pilosicoli were grown 72-96 hours sooner than s. aureus and after the inoculum of the latter the plates were anaerobically incubated for additional 48-72 hours. the phenomenon was more clearly observed when b. (s.) pilosicoli had a concentration of 8x10(6)-8x10(7) cfu/ml and s. aureus at a concentration ranging  from 10(7) to 10(1) cfu/ml was inoculated at a distance from the streaks of b. (s.) pilosicoli ranging from 0-10 mm. when b. (s.) pilosicoli and s. aureus were  inoculated at the same time and when b. (s.) pilosicoli grew 24-48 hours sooner than s. aureus only a cooperative haemolysis was observed.
