effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
this study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/l), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/l; origanum oil, 0.50 g/l, and peppermint oil, 1 g/l), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/l) in vitro. methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. protozoa population decreased, but abundances of ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella bryantii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella ruminicola, clostridium aminophilum, and ruminobacter amylophilus increased with increasing doses of vanillin. origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. all the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, selenomonas ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola and p. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. the abundances of megasphaera elsdenii, c. aminophilum, and clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of b. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of s. ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola, and p. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). the results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.
diet-dependent shifts in the bacterial population of the rumen revealed with real-time pcr.
a set of pcr primers was designed and validated for specific detection and quantification of prevotella ruminicola, prevotella albensis, prevotella bryantii, fibrobacter succinogenes, selenomonas ruminantium-mitsuokella multiacida, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus flavefaciens, ruminobacter amylophilus, eubacterium ruminantium, treponema bryantii, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and anaerovibrio lipolytica. by using these primers and the real-time pcr technique, the corresponding species in the rumens of cows for which the diet was switched from hay to grain were quantitatively monitored. the dynamics of two fibrolytic bacteria, f. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens, were in agreement with those of earlier, culture-based experiments. the quantity of f. succinogenes dna, predominant in animals on the hay diet, fell 20-fold on the third day of the switch to a grain diet and further declined on day 28, with a 57-fold reduction in dna. the r. flavefaciens dna concentration on day 3 declined to approximately 10% of its initial value in animals on the hay diet and remained at this level on day 28. during the transition period (day 3), the quantities of two ruminal prevotella dnas increased considerably: that of p. ruminicola increased 7-fold and that of p. bryantii increased 263-fold. on day 28, the quantity of p. ruminicola dna decreased 3-fold, while p. bryantii dna was still elevated 10-fold in comparison with the level found in animals on the initial hay diet. the dna specific for another xylanolytic bacterium, e. ruminantium, dropped 14-fold during the diet switch and was maintained at this level on day 28. the concentration of a rumen spirochete, t. bryantii, decreased less profoundly and stabilized with a sevenfold decline by day 28. the variations in a. lipolytica dna were not statistically significant. after an initial slight increase in s. dextrinosolvens dna on day 3, this dna was not detected at the end of the experiment. s. bovis dna displayed a 67-fold increase during the transition period on day 3. however, on day 28, it actually declined in comparison with the level in animals on the hay ration. the amount of s. ruminantium-m. multiacida dna also increased eightfold following the diet switch, but stabilized with only a twofold increase on day 28. the real-time pcr technique also uncovered differential amplification of rumen bacterial templates with the set of universal bacterial primers. this observation may explain why some predominant rumen bacteria have not been detected in pcr-generated 16s ribosomal dna libraries.
