TI  == cloning and expression of the glutamate racemase gene of bacillus pumilus.
AB  == a glutamate racemase gene (muri) was found in bacillus pumilus cells and cloned into escherichia coli wm335, a d-glutamate auxotroph, by means of a genetic complement method. muri of b. pumilus encodes a 272-amino acid protein with an unusual initiation codon, ttg. the deduced amino acid sequence shows significant  similarity with those of glutamate racemases from e. coli (ratio of identical residues, 28%), pediococcus pentosaceus (44%), and staphylococcus haemolyticus (49%). b. pumilus muri was expressed as a fusion protein connected to the n-terminal 12 residues of beta-galactosidase; the fusion protein showed glutamate racemase activity, and resembled the enzyme of p. pentosaceus in physicochemical  and enzymological properties.
