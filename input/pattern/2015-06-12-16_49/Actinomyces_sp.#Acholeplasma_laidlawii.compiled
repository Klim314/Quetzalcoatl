TI  - [Examination of cattle with respiratory diseases for Mycoplasma and bacterial bronchopneumonia agents].
AB  - A total of 247 mycoplasma strains was isolated from 435 lungs, tracheobronchial secretions and nasal swabs originating from cattle with symptoms of bronchopneumonia. Mycoplasma (M.) bovis was found 89 times (36%) and was the most common mycoplasma species in the lungs. M. bovirhinis, M. bovigenitalium, M. spec. and Acholeplasma (A.) laidlawii were isolated 158 times (64%). Among these mycoplasmas M. bovirhinis was the most widespread species (114 isolations). In 55 cases (62%) M. bovis was associated with Pasteurella or Actinomyces (A.) pyogenes. The other mycoplasma species were found in 67 cases (42%) together with these bacteria. Without mycoplasmas Pasteurella and A. pyogenes occurred in 33 of the probes investigated (21%). Beside mycoplasmas Haemophilus (H.) somnus was isolated from 16 of 162 tracheobronchial secretions investigated. The results confirm earlier suppositions that in most of the cases bronchopneumonia of cattle is a multifactorial event, frequently associated with mycoplasmas--especially M. bovis.
