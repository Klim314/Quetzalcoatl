TI  == the iron- and temperature-regulated cjrbc genes of shigella and enteroinvasive escherichia coli strains code for colicin js uptake.
AB  == a cosmid library of dna from colicin js-sensitive enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec) strain o164 was made in colicin js-resistant strain e. coli vcs257, and colicin js-sensitive clones were identified. sensitivity to colicin js was associated with the carriage of a three-gene operon upstream of and partially overlapping senb. the open reading frames were designated cjrabc (for colicin js  receptor), coding for proteins of 291, 258, and 753 amino acids, respectively. tn7 insertions in any of them led to complete resistance to colicin js. a near-consensus fur box was found upstream of cjra, suggesting regulation of the cjr operon by iron levels. cjra protein was homologous to iron-regulated pseudomonas aeruginosa protein phuw, whose function is unknown; cjrb was homologous to the tonb protein from pseudomonas putida; and cjrc was homologous to a putative outer membrane siderophore receptor from campylobacter jejuni. cloning experiments showed that the cjrb and cjrc genes are sufficient for colicin js sensitivity. uptake of colicin js into sensitive bacteria was dependent on the exbb protein but not on the e. coli k-12 tonb and tola, -b, and  -q proteins. sensitivity to colicin js is positively regulated by temperature via the virb protein and negatively controlled by the iron source through the fur protein. among eiec strains, two types of colicin js-sensitive phenotypes were identified that differed in sensitivity to colicin js by 1 order of magnitude. the difference in sensitivity to colicin js is not due to differences between the sequences of the cjrb and cjrc proteins.

TI  == freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  == freeze-substitution was performed on strains of escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, campylobacter fetus, vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, aeromonas salmonicida, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, caulobacter crescentus, and leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. a thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width  was displayed in e. coli k-12, k30, and his 1 (a k-12 derivative containing the k30 capsule genes), p. multocida, c. fetus, p. putida, a. salmonicida, h. pleuropneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. the other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular  to the cell surface, was observed on e. coli k30 and his 1 and p. mirabilis cells. a more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of h. pleuropneumoniae. for the first time a capsule,  distinct from the sheath, was observed on l. discophora. in all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such  as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. other distinct envelope structures were  observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of l. discophora and the s layers of a. salmonicida a450 and c. crescentus cb15a. we believe that the  freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of microgard against food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == microgard, a commercially available fermented milk product containing antimicrobial metabolites, was a potent inhibitor for gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas, salmonella, and yersinia when 1% concentration was incorporated into agar media. gram-positive bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes were insensitive to microgard. kluyveromyces marxianus, an unidentified black yeast, and penicillium expansum were partially suppressed, whereas aspergillus niger and a yogurt spoilage yeast were tolerant to 5% microgard. optimum activity of microgard was at ph 5.3 and below; the concentration that gave complete inhibition depended upon the number of bacteria  present as well as the genus tested. blood agar base reversed the antagonistic activity of microgard against pseudomonas putida compared with plate count agar.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
