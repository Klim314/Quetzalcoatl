in vitro susceptibility of avian escherichia coli and pasteurella multocida to danofloxacin and five other antimicrobials.
the in vitro susceptibility of escherichia coli and pasteurella multocida isolated from poultry was determined to danofloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone, and five other commonly used antimicrobials. a total of 1737 e. coli field isolates and 107 p. multocida isolates were tested by veterinary diagnostic laboratories in europe, japan, south africa, and north america during the period 1989-91. the antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was determined using the sensititre broth microdilution technique. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of danofloxacin, furaltadone, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, spectinomycin, and trimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole that prevented growth of 90% of the bacteria were 0.25 > 64, > 64, > 64, > 128, and > 16 micrograms/ml, respectively, against e. coli isolates and 0.25, 64, 64, 16, 128, and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively, against p. multocida isolates. danofloxacin demonstrated considerable in vitro potency against these important poultry pathogens, many of which showed extensive resistance to the other antimicrobials tested.
