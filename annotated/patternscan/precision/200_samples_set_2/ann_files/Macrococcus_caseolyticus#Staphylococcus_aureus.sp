TI  == radiation-resistant macrococcus caseolyticus (a) isolated from radiation-processed semidried prawns.
AB  == a radiation-resistant bacterial isolate from gamma-radiation-processed (5 kgy) semidried prawns was identified as a new strain of macrococcus caseolyticus and was designated as m. caseolyticus (a) on the basis of morphological and biochemical characterization and 16s rrna sequencing. dna-dna hybridization studies with m. caseolyticus dsm 20597(t) further confirmed the isolate as m. caseolyticus. major fatty acids present in m. caseolyticus (a) were c14:0, c16:1omega11c, and c18:1omega9c, whereas c15:0anteiso, c16:0iso, and c18:0iso were absent. the closest match for the isolate, as per fatty acid methyl ester analysis, was m. caseolyticus dsm 20597(t). however, the similarity index was significantly low (0.112), which indicates that the isolate could be a new strain of m. caseolyticus. the decimal reduction dose (d10) for m. caseolyticus (a), m.  caseolyticus jcsc5402, and staphylococcus aureus mtcc96 was 1.18, 0.607, and 0.19 kgy, respectively. this is the first report on radiation resistance of m. caseolyticus. macrococcus caseolyticus (a) is more resistant to gamma and uv radiation stress than are m. caseolyticus jcsc5402 and s. aureus mtcc96; however, it is sensitive to heat as well as desiccation stress.

TI  == methicillin resistance in staphylococcus isolates: the "mec alphabet" with specific consideration of mecc, a mec homolog associated with zoonotic s. aureus  lineages.
AB  == livestock-associated (la) methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) have globally emerged during the past decade. in europe, this was particularly due to  the occurrence of la-mrsa strains associated with the clonal complex (cc) 398 as  defined by multilocus sequence typing. however, more recently animal-adapted clonal lineages of s. aureus showing phenotypic methicillin resistance have been  identified such as cc130, cc599, cc59, cc1943 and cc425. these newly emerging la-mrsa ccs/sts caused infections in animals and zoonoses in humans. in contrast  to other s. aureus clonal lineages, the methicillin resistance of the latter ccs/sts is based on a meca gene homolog, designated mecc, which is part of a distinct sccmec type (sccmec xi). including mecb found in macrococcus caseolyticus, henceforth, the "mec alphabet" comprises three major gene types with several allotypes. as known for meca, the gene homolog mecc is also not restricted to s. aureus, but found in several staphylococcal species including s. sciuri, s. stepanovicii and s. xylosus (mecc1 allotype). first investigations showed a wide geographical distribution of mecc-mrsa in europe and a broad diversity of host species including livestock, companion and wildlife animals. in particular, wild rodents and insectivores might serve as reservoir for staphylococci harboring mecc. economic burden may be caused by mastitis of dairy  cattle. livestock animals may likely serve as source for human infections with mecc-mrsa; reported cases comprise skin and soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis and bacteremia. due to the divergent molecular nature of mecc-mrsa, its diagnostics is hampered by difficulties to verify the methicillin resistance using phenotypic as well as dna-based procedures, which could have negative consequences for therapy of mecc-mrsa-caused infections.

TI  == short communication: prevalence of methicillin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus isolated from bulk milk on organic and conventional dairy farms in the united states.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. in bulk tank milk samples from 288 organic and conventional dairy farms located in new york, wisconsin, and oregon from march 2009 to may 2011. due to recent publications reporting the presence mecc (a meca homolog not detected by traditional meca-based pcr methods), a combination of genotypic and phenotypic approaches was used to enhance the recovery of methicillin-resistant organisms from bulk tank milk. in total, 13 isolates were identified as methicillin resistant: staph. aureus (n=1), staphylococcus sciuri (n=5), staphylococcus chromogenes (n=2), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n=3), staphylococcus agnetis (n=1), and macrococcus caseolyticus (n=1). the single methicillin-resistant staph. aureus isolate was identified from an organic farm in new york, for an observed 0.3% prevalence at the farm level. the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci prevalence was 2% in the organic population and 5% in the conventional population. we did not identify mecc in any of the isolates from our population.  of interest was the relatively high number of methicillin-resistant staph. sciuri recovered, as the number of isolates from our study was considerably higher than  those recovered from other recent studies that also assessed milk samples. our research suggests that the presence of a potential methicillin-resistant staphylococcus reservoir in milk, and likely the dairy farm population in the united states, is independent of the organic or conventional production system.

TI  == detection of the staphylococcal multiresistance gene cfr in macrococcus caseolyticus and jeotgalicoccus pinnipedialis.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the presence and the genetic environment of the multiresistance gene cfr in jeotgalicoccus pinnipedialis and macrococcus caseolyticus from pigs. methods: a total of 391 bacterial isolates with florfenicol mics >/=16 mg/l were obtained from nasal swabs of 557 individual pigs; of these, 75 gram-positive isolates other than staphylococci and enterococci were screened by pcr for the presence of known florfenicol resistance genes. species assignments of the cfr-carrying isolates were based on the results of biochemical profiling and 16s rdna sequencing. the locations of the cfr gene were determined by southern blotting. regions flanking each cfr gene were sequenced by a modified random primer walking strategy, and the transferability of cfr was assessed by electrotransformation. results: two m. caseolyticus isolates and one j. pinnipedialis isolate were cfr positive. the cfr gene was located either on a 7057 bp plasmid, pss-03, which was widely distributed among staphylococci of pig origin, or on the approximately 53 kb plasmid pjp1. the region of pjp1 that included the cfr gene and the adjacent is21-558, showed 99.7% identity to the corresponding region of plasmid pscfs3. in addition, the genes aadd + aaca-aphd, ble and erm(c), coding for aminoglycoside, bleomycin and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance, respectively, were also identified on plasmid pjp1. conclusions: this study showed that plasmids carrying the multidrug resistance gene cfr are present in two new genera of commensal and  environmental bacteria, macrococcus and jeotgalicoccus. this observation underlines the role of commensal and environmental flora in the dissemination of  clinically important resistance genes, such as cfr.

TI  == complete genome sequence of macrococcus caseolyticus strain jcscs5402, [corrected] reflecting the ancestral genome of the human-pathogenic staphylococci.
AB  == we isolated the methicillin-resistant macrococcus caseolyticus strain jcsc5402 from animal meat in a supermarket and determined its whole-genome nucleotide sequence. this is the first report on the genome analysis of a macrococcal species that is evolutionarily closely related to the human pathogens staphylococcus aureus and bacillus anthracis. the essential biological pathways of m. caseolyticus are similar to those of staphylococci. however, the species has a small chromosome (2.1 mb) and lacks many sugar and amino acid metabolism pathways and a plethora of virulence genes that are present in s. aureus. on the  other hand, m. caseolyticus possesses a series of oxidative phosphorylation machineries that are closely related to those in the family bacillaceae. we also  discovered a probable primordial form of a macrococcus methicillin resistance gene complex, meciram, on one of the eight plasmids harbored by the m. caseolyticus strain. this is the first finding of a plasmid-encoding methicillin  resistance gene. macrococcus is considered to reflect the genome of ancestral bacteria before the speciation of staphylococcal species and may be closely associated with the origin of the methicillin resistance gene complex of the notorious human pathogen methicillin-resistant s. aureus.
