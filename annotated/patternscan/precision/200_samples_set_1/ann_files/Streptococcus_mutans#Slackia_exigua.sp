TI  == microbiota of severe early childhood caries before and after therapy.
AB  == severe early childhood caries (ecc) is difficult to treat successfully. this study aimed to characterize the microbiota of severe ecc and evaluate whether baseline or follow-up microbiotas are associated with new lesions post-treatment. plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed by a 16s rrna-based microarray and by pcr for selected taxa. severe-ecc children were monitored for 12 months post-therapy. by microarray, species associated with severe-ecc (n = 53) compared with caries-free (n = 32) children included slackia exigua (p = 0.002), streptococcus parasanguinis (p = 0.013), and prevotella species (p < 0.02). by pcr, severe-ecc-associated taxa included bifidobacteriaceae (p < 0.001), scardovia wiggsiae (p = 0.003), streptococcus mutans with bifidobacteria  (p < 0.001), and s. mutans with s. wiggsiae (p = 0.001). in follow-up, children without new lesions (n = 36) showed lower detection of taxa including s. mutans,  changes not observed in children with follow-up lesions (n = 17). partial least-squares modeling separated the children into caries-free and two severe-ecc groups with either a stronger bacterial or a stronger dietary component. we conclude that several species, including s. wiggsiae and s. exigua, are associated with the ecology of advanced caries, that successful treatment is accompanied by a change in the microbiota, and that severe ecc is diverse, with influences from selected bacteria or from diet.
