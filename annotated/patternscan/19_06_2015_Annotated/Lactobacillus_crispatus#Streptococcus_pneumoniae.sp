TI  == enolases from gram-positive bacterial pathogens and commensal lactobacilli share  functional similarity in virulence-associated traits.
AB  == enolase occurs as a cytoplasmic and a surface-associated protein in bacteria. enolases of the bacterial pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus, as well as of the commensal lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus johnsonii, were purified as his(6)-fusion proteins from recombinant escherichia coli. the fusion proteins were compared for putative virulence-associated functions, i.e., binding of human plasminogen, enhancement of plasminogen activation by human plasminogen activators, as well as binding to immobilized laminin, fibronectin and collagens. the individual enolases showed varying efficiencies in these functions. in particular, highly and equally effective interactions with plasminogen and laminin were seen with lactobacillar and staphylococcal enolases.
