TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == oral streptococcal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mediates interaction  with porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with plaque-forming bacteria is necessary for its colonization in periodontal pockets. participation of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and p. gingivalis fimbriae in this interaction has been reported. in this investigation, the contribution of various oral streptococcal gapdhs to interaction with p. gingivalis fimbriae was examined. streptococcal cell surface gapdh activity was measured by incubation of a constant number of streptococci with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and analysis for the conversion of nad+ to nadh based  on the absorbance at 340 nm. coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric assay. cell surface gapdh activity was correlated with coaggregation activity (r = 0.854, p < 0.01) with spearman's rank correlation coefficient. s. oralis atcc 9811 and atcc 10557, streptococcus gordonii g9b, streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556, and streptococcus parasanguinis atcc 15909 exhibited high cell surface gapdh activity and coaggregation activity; consequently, their cell surface gapdhs were extracted with mutanolysin and purified on a cibacron blue sepharose column. subsequently, their dna sequences were elucidated. purified gapdhs bound p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin by western blot assay, furthermore, their dna sequences displayed a high degree of homology with one another. moreover, s. oralis recombinant gapdh inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and the aforementioned five streptococcal strains in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that gapdhs of various  plaque-forming streptococci may be involved in their attachment to p. gingivalis  fimbriae and that they may contribute to p. gingivalis colonization.
