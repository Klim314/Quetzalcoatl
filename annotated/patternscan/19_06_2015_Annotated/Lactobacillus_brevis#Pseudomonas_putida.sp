TI  == a novel d-mandelate dehydrogenase used in three-enzyme cascade reaction for highly efficient synthesis of non-natural chiral amino acids.
AB  == a novel nad(+)-dependent d-mandelate dehydrogenase was identified from lactobacillus brevis (lbdmdh). after purified to homogeneity, the optimum ph and  temperature for oxidation of d-mandelate were ph 10.0 and 40 degrees c, and the km and kcat were 1.1 mm and 355 s(-1) respectively. employing the lbdmdh together with a mandelate racemase from pseudomonas putida and a leucine dehydrogenase (esleudh) from exiguobacterium sibiricum, we established a three-step one-pot domino reaction system for preparing chiral l-phenylglycine from racemic mandelic acid with internal cofactor recycling. under the optimum conditions, 30.4 g rac-mandelic acid (0.2 m) at 1l scale had been converted into chiral l-phenylglycine, with 96.4% conversion, 86.5% isolation yield, >99% eep and 50.4  gl(-1)d(-1) space-time yield.
