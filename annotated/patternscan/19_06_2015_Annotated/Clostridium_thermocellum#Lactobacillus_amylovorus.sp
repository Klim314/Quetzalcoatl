TI  == recovery and purification of oligosaccharides from copra meal by recombinant endo-beta-mannanase and deciphering molecular mechanism involved and its role as  potent therapeutic agent.
AB  == production of manno-oligosaccharides (moss) from pretreated and defatted copra meal (dfco) hydrolysis was achieved by endo-mannanase. structural characterization of dfco by ft-ir and nmr exhibited resemblance with galactomannan. the time-dependent hydrolysis of dfco by recombinant endo-beta-(1  --> 4)-mannanase of clostridium thermocellum by tlc and hpaec displayed the release of mannose and moss mannobiose and mannotriose. purified moss yielded 40  % mannobiose and 18 % mannotriose confirmed by mass spectroscopy which showed mannobiose (m/z = 365) and mannotriose (m/z = 527). the homology based structural analysis of catalytic endo-mannanase (ctmant) showed the catalytic core composed  of glu181 and glu300 acting as acid/base and glu288 as a nucleophile during galactomannan hydrolysis. sub-site mapping of ctmant exhibited two aglycone and four glycone sites at cleavage sites existing on either side of beta-(1 --> 4)-linkage of galactomannan. isolated moss displayed potential prebiotic characteristics and supported higher growth of probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis than with standard inulin. moreover, moss displayed over 97 % tolerance to simulated gastric juice, intestinal fluid,  and alpha-amylase proving its potential as a stable prebiotic over inulin. in vitro cytotoxicity assay of moss (500 microg/ml) on human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (ht-29) demonstrated 60 % decreased viability of cells after 48 h displaying anti-tumorigenic property.
