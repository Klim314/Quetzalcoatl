TI  == specific gut microbiota features and metabolic markers in postmenopausal women with obesity.
AB  == background: gut microbial gene richness and specific bacterial species are associated with metabolic risk markers in humans, but the impact of host physiology and dietary habits on the link between the gut microbiota and metabolic markers remain unclear. the objective of this study was to identify gut metagenomic markers associated with estimates of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and inflammation in obesity, and to explore whether the associations between metagenomic and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for body fat, age and habitual dietary intake. methods: faecal dna from 53 women with obesity was analysed through quantitative metagenomic sequencing and analysis, and a systematic search was performed for bacterial genes associated with estimates of insulin resistance, inflammation and lipid metabolism. subsequently, the correlations between metagenomic species and metabolic markers were tested by linear regression models, with and without covariate adjustment. results: one hundred and fourteen metagenomic species correlated with metabolic markers (p<0.001) including akkermansia muciniphila, bilophila wadsworthia, bifidobacterium longum and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but also species not previously associated with metabolic markers including bacteroides faecis and dorea longicatena. the majority of the identified correlations between bacterial  species and metabolic markers persisted after adjustment for differences in body  fat, age and dietary macronutrient composition; however, the negative correlation with insulin resistance observed for b. longum and f. prausnitzii appeared to be  modified by the intake of dietary fibre and fat, respectively. conclusions: this  study shows that several gut bacterial species are linked to metabolic risk markers in obesity, also after adjustment for potential confounders, such as long-term diet composition. the study supports the use of gut metagenomic markers for metabolic disease prediction and warrants further investigation of causality.

TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == faecal levels of bifidobacterium and clostridium coccoides but not plasma lipopolysaccharide are inversely related to insulin and homa index in women.
AB  == background & aims: the abundance of specific microbes might be associated with plasma lipopolysaccharide and insulin levels. the aims were to quantify the abundance of specific microbes and plasma lps in females and assess their association with anthropometric, body composition and biochemical measurements. methods: seventeen lean (bmi 19-24.99 kg/m(2)) and fifteen obese females (bmi > 30 kg/m(2)) participated. anthropometry, body composition, food intake and biochemical analyses were assessed. bacterial groups in faeces were analysed by qpcr method. results: lactobacillus plantarum prevalence was higher (p = 0.005) and its counts tended to be higher in lean vs. obese group (p = 0.06). bifidobacterium genus, bifidobacterium longum, clostridium coccoides and clostridium leptum counts were higher in lean women (p < 0.05); prevalence and counts of akkermansia muciniphila tended to be higher in lean group (p = 0.09, p  = 0.06, respectively). plasma lps levels were similar between the study groups (p > 0.05). no association was found between lps and bacterial levels or insulin. bifidobacteria and c. coccoides counts were inversely associated with insulin and homa index. conclusions: abundance of specific microbes is distinct between obese and lean women, but is not associated with lps level. bifidobacterial and c. coccoides levels are associated with insulin sensitivity. these bacterial groups  may be capable of modulating insulin action.

TI  == arabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin-degradation in humanized rats.
AB  == the endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. in this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long-chain arabinoxylans (lc-ax) and the well-established prebiotic inulin (in) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum ( approximately 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with  verrucomicrobia and firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of bacteroidetes. moreover, different bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (b. adolescentis) and mucus (b. longum and b. bifidum). both lc-ax and in increased scfa levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health-promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. by applying a high-resolution phylogenetic micro-array (hitchip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), in and lc-ax were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate-producers (roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (b. longum) respectively. prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin-degrading akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by  the host. both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for lc-ax  (threefold) and in (sixfold). these mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of akkermansia muciniphila for lc-ax and especially in-treated rats. finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine-tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. our results demonstrate that next to in, lc-ax are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health-promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin-degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.
