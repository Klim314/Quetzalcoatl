TI  - Oral Microbiota Shift after 12-Week Supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289; A Randomized Control Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA hypervariable region V3-V4 after 12 weeks of daily Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289 consumption. Forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 CFU of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). Presence of L. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific PCR. Tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. A total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. After removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the Human Oral Microbiome Database. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. Streptococcus was the most common genus and the S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group comprised the dominant species. The number of observed species was unaffected by L. reuteri exposure. However, subjects who had consumed L. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and PCR detected L. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. L. reuteri intake correlated with increased S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group and Campylobacter concisus, Granulicatella adiacens, Bergeyella sp. HOT322, Neisseria subflava, and SR1 [G-1] sp. HOT874 detection and reduced S. mutans, S. anginosus, N. mucosa, Fusobacterium periodicum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii, and Prevotella maculosa detection. This effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. CONCLUSIONS: L. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. The biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02311218.
TI  - Colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. This in vitro study investigated the colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola). METHODS: The grown biofilm consisted of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella dispar, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia, T. denticola, Actinomyces oris, Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". After 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected S. oralis, but not other species. The "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. A co-localisation trend was observed between P. gingivalis and T. denticola, as determined by FISH. However, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially S. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both CLSM and SEM. CONCLUSIONS: While the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. This antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - Impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. The model included Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Actinomycesoris, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, Veillonella dispar, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola. Based on literature, we considered Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, and Actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. We quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative PCR and further compared the structures using confocal laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. The biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. However, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. In the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. Moreover, besides a significant increase of P. intermedia and a decrease of P. gingivalis , P. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. A. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. Hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on P. intermedia and P. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. Streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of P. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence P. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.
TI  - No evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (TCS)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to TCS toothpaste. Therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to TCS in toothpaste selects for TCS-resistant bacteria within the oral biofilm. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. Participants had been randomly assigned to use TCS (3000 mug/mL TCS) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n = 22). Diluted plaque samples were plated on to Wilkins-Chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and TCS (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/mL) and incubated at 37 degrees C under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. Selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing and TCS minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined for each isolate. RESULTS: At 3000 mug/mL TCS no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. The MICs of TCS for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/mL in both groups. Species common to both groups had similar MICs. Veillonella parvula and Campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar MICs in both groups. CONCLUSION: The use of TCS-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in MIC of TCS of oral bacterial isolates.
TI  - Validation of antibiotic efficacy on in vitro subgingival biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic antibiotics are often used as adjunctive treatment modalities for periodontal diseases. Testing of antimicrobial efficacy can be relevant only if the bacteria are in the form of biofilms rather than the planktonic state, and at concentrations of physiologic relevance, i.e., reachable in the periodontal pocket. The aim of the present study is to test the antimicrobial efficacy of five common antibiotic schemes at physiologically relevant concentrations on a multispecies in vitro biofilm model. METHODS: A 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model was exposed to metronidazole (15 mug/mL), amoxicillin (15 mug/mL), metronidazole and amoxicillin in combination, doxycycline (2 mug/mL), and azithromycin (10 mug/mL) over 24 hours. Species-specific bacterial numbers were determined by culture on selective agar media or by epifluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Metronidazole alone did not affect biofilm composition. Total bacterial counts were significantly reduced by doxycycline, azithromycin, and amoxicillin alone or in combination with metronidazole, albeit by less than 1 log. On the species-specific level, these regimens significantly reduced the numbers of Streptococcus anginosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as Campylobacter rectus (except for amoxicillin alone). The strongest effects were displayed by the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. CONCLUSION: Antibiotics at concentrations detectable in gingival crevicular fluid do not dramatically reduce total bacterial loads in this in vitro biofilm model, but cause species-specific reductions, which may disrupt the biofilm unity.
TI  - Validation of a quantitative real-time PCR assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. Owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. The aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts on selective agar plates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 10 species included in the in vitro biofilm were Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Actinomyces oris, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. The numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qPCR, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of CFUs after growth on selective agar plates. RESULTS: All 10 species were successfully quantified using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers of CFUs after growth on selective agar. In early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between methods. In late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, but not by CFU counts, maintained significant correlation. CFU counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. However, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. This may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.
TI  - Ascending necrotizing fasciitis of the face following odontogenic infection.
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) of the face is a rare but extremely dangerous complication of dental infection associated with a nearly 30% mortality rate. This infection spreads rapidly along the superficial fascial planes of the head and neck and can lead to severe disfigurement. Reports in the literature of cases of NF of the face caused by dental infection are few. We report such a case in a 36-year-old woman and review the current standards of diagnosis and management. The patient initially presented with pain and severe swelling in the left side of her face subsequent to a dental infection. The symptoms had progressed quickly and had not improved with administration of oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting. The patient had no palpable crepitus despite its classic association with NF. The infection also took a rare, ascending route of spread with involvement of the temporalis muscle. Cultures taken during debridement grew Streptococcus anginosus and Bacteroides. Biopsies of involved muscle showed histologic evidence of necrosis. Through early surgical intervention including aggressive debridement, and the adjunctive use of appropriate antibiotics, the patient recovered with minimal loss of facial mass and no skin loss. Although NF of the face is rare, the surgeon must maintain a high index of suspicion with any patient presenting after a dental infection with rapid progression of swelling and a disproportionate amount of pain that is unresponsive to antibiotics.
TI  - Amplification of minute amounts of oral bacterial DNA for real-time quantitative  PCR analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-throughput technologies for typing caries or health-associated bacterial populations including PCR, DNA microarrays and next-generation sequencing techniques require significant amounts of bacterial DNA. In clinical settings, the amount of sampled DNA is often limited and amplification is therefore essential. Protocols should be able to reproducibly amplify sequences in order to maintain initial sequence ratios and should not bias the representation of particular DNA sequence types. METHODS: A linear amplification protocol using DNA polymerase I was modified to permit the amplification and subsequent analysis of small amounts of bacterial DNA. The protocol was tested on human oral bacterial biofilms from different sources, including carious dentine and plaque, and compared to amplification by degenerate PCR of 16S rDNA sequences. Real-time quantitative PCR of 24 bacterial species was used as a readout system to test amplified DNA against unamplified DNA. RESULTS: The amplification protocol reliably yielded 5-10 mug DNA from as little as 12.5 ng of template DNA. Correlation coefficients between real-time quantitative PCR results from amplified and unamplified DNA were between 0.78 and 0.98. CONCLUSION: The optimized protocol consistently produced amplification products from minute amounts of bacterial DNA from caries and plaque; the amplification products are suitable for downstream genetic analyses.
TI  - Hydrogen sulfide production from cysteine and homocysteine by periodontal and oral bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds  (VSCs) produced by oral bacteria. This study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. METHODS: L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (METase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta C-S) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. Enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. The enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing L-cysteine or DL-homocysteine were assayed. RESULTS: With L-cysteine as the substrate, Streptococcus anginosus FW73 produced the most hydrogen sulfide, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 33277 and W83 and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the P. gingivalis strains. Finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival plaque was analyzed. Using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. However, further innovation is required for practical use.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  - Extracts or alkaloids isolated from Mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. In this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a M. aquifolium extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the M. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. The values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. The most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was Porphyromonas gingivalis.
TI  - Bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: Samples collected from five infected root canals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers. Products of these PCRs were cloned and sequenced. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used as a screening method to reduce the number of clones necessary for DNA sequencing. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. In total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. Olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Dialister invisus, Lachnospiraceae oral clone, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. The majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example Tannerella forsythia, Shuttleworthia satelles and Filifactor alocis. Some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. METHODS: Samples were collected from the root canals using #15 Hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. RESULTS: The mean number of species per sample was 22. Enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), Campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), Leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), Neisseria mucosa (87.5%), Prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), Eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), Streptococcus anginosus (75%), and Veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. The species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), E. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), E. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), N. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), V. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), C. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), Treponema socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), Micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), Prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). Most of these species were also found in high proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
TI  - Coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic Enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - Interactions between Enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus anginosus. Intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. All E. faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with F. nucleatum; E. faecalis did not coaggregate with P. anaerobius or S. anginosus. One strain, E. faecalis E1, coaggregated with P. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. Coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis and F. nucleatum observed in this study suggest a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.
TI  - Influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. In eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated. After 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. Of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. When bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. Combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. When no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the quality of the root filling. In contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. In root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. The present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.
TI  - Bacterial profile and burden of periodontal infection in subjects with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis has been identified as a potential risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. It is possible that the stimulation of host responses to oral infections may result in vascular damage and the inducement of blood clotting. The aim of this study was to assess the role of periodontal infection and bacterial burden as an explanatory variable to the activation of the inflammatory process leading to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS: A total of 161 consecutive surviving cases admitted with a diagnosis of ACS and 161 control subjects, matched with cases according to their gender, socioeconomic level, and smoking status, were studied. Serum white blood cell (WBC) counts, high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL/LDL) levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsC-rp) levels, and clinical periodontal routine parameters were studied. The subgingival pathogens were assayed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Total oral bacterial load was higher in the subjects with ACS (mean difference: 17.4x10(5); SD: 10.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2 to 17.4; P<0.001), and significant for 26 of 40 species including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Treponema denticola. Serum WBC counts, hsC-rp levels, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis, were explanatory factors to acute coronary syndrome status (Nagelkerke r2=0.49). CONCLUSION: The oral bacterial load of S. intermedius, S. sanguis, Streptococcus anginosus, T. forsythensis, T. denticola, and P. gingivalis may be concomitant risk factors in the development of ACS.
TI  - The efficacy of povidone-iodine products against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - A total of 8 strains of 6 bacterial species, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC33277 and TDC286, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC29523 and JP2, Fusobacterium nucleatum No. 2, Tannerella forsythensis ATCC43937, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611 and Streptococcus anginosus ATCC33397, were treated with povidone-iodine (PVP-I) gargle (PVP-I: 0.47 and 0.23% w/v) or chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) gargle (CHG: 0.002% w/v) for 15, 30 or 60 s, after which they were inoculated into various media, cultured and counted for residual bacteria. At both concentrations, PVP-I gargle reduced the viable cell count of all 8 bacterial strains to below the measurable limit within 15 s. By contrast, there were more than 1,000 viable colonies 60 s following treatment with the CHG gargle. The results demonstrate that povidone-iodine gargle has rapid bactericidal activity against the causative bacteria of periodontal disease.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Direct amplification of rRNA gene sequences for identification of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections and their relationship with symptoms using a highly sensitive technique, the polymerase chain reaction. METHODOLOGY: Samples were obtained from 91 infected teeth associated with periradicular lesions, including cases of acute periradicular abscesses. DNA was extracted from the samples and analysed for the presence of target microbial species using a PCR-based identification assay. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria. Streptococcus anginosus group was detected in 16.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum in 14.3%, and Bacteroides forsythus in 7.1% of the abscess samples. No pus sample yielded Actinomyces israelii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fungal species. In general, B. forsythus was found in 20% of the cases (16 of 80), S. anginosus in 12% (6 of 50), F. nucleatum in 10% (6 of 60) and A. israelii in 5% (two of 40). A. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any case. Fungi were present in only one of 50 cases (2%). There was no correlation between the species and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Direct molecular approaches appear to be a valuable tool for the rapid and reliable diagnosis of infectious diseases, as well as for research purposes. There was no correlation between target microbial species and symptoms.
TI  - Proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  - Subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. Their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. To determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota, we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. Eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). After three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. Proteolytic activity (U/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. It was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited, and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than in control (peptone broth). Among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella buccae and Prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. The frequent occurrence of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. Albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. It is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. Enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Prevention mouthrinse.
AB  - Prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. To determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. A spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Serratia marcescens and Candida albicans. Microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. Inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. MIC determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to Prevention mouthrinse, with MICs ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold dilutions. Bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. Brief (5-minute) exposure of S. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. Under the constraints of this type of study, Prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. We support the notion that Prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. A 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of Prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.
