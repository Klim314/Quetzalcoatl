TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == thiouracil-forming bacteria identified and characterized upon porcine in vitro digestion of brassicaceae feed.
AB  == in recent years, the frequent detection of the banned thyreostat thiouracil (tu)  in livestock urine has been related to endogenous tu formation following digestion of glucosinolate-rich brassicaceae crops. recently, it was demonstrated that, upon in vitro digestion of brassicaceae, fecal bacteria induce tu detection in livestock (porcine livestock > bovines). therefore, the present study was intended to isolate and identify bacteria involved in this intestinal tu formation upon brassicaceae digestion and to gain more insight into the underlying mechanism in porcine livestock. twenty porcine fecal inocula (gilts and multiparous sows) were assessed through static in vitro colonic-digestion simulations with rapeseed. after derivatization and extraction of the fecal suspensions, tu was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms(2)). on average, lower tu concentrations were observed in fecal colonic simulations in gilts (8.35 ng g(-1) rapeseed +/- 3.42 [mean +/- standard deviation]) than in multiparous sows (52.63 ng g(-1) +/- 16.17), which correlates with maturation of the gut microbial population with age. further exploration of  the mechanism showed cell-dependent activity of the microbial conversion and sustained tu-forming activity after subjection of the fecal inoculum to moderate  heat over a time span of up to 30 min. finally, nine tu-producing bacterial species were successfully isolated and identified by a combination of biochemical and molecular techniques as escherichia coli (n = 5), lactobacillus reuteri (n =  2), enterococcus faecium (n = 1), and salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae (n = 1). this report demonstrates that endogenous formation of tu is brassicaceae induced and occurs under colonic conditions most likely through myrosinase-like enzyme activity expressed by different common intestinal bacterial species.

TI  == potential of goat probiotic to bind mutagens.
AB  == the mutagen binding ability of the goat probiotics (lactobacillus reuteri ddl 19, lactobacillus alimentarius ddl 48, enterococcus faecium dde 39, and bifidobacterium bifidum ddba) was evaluated. the oral administration of these probiotics reduced fecal mutagens and intestinal cancer markers in goats. secondly, the effects of probiotics against the mutagenesis induced by sodium azide (sa), and benzopyrene (b[alpha]p) by performing the modified ames test using salmonella typhimurium ta 100 was investigated. the capacity to bind benzopyrene and the stability of the bacterial-mutagen complex was analyzed by hplc. the dismutagenic potential against both mutagens was proportional to probiotic concentration. results showed that probiotic antimutagenic capacity against sa was ranging from 13 to 78%. the mixture of four goat probiotics (mgp)  displayed higher antimutagenic activity against sa than any individual strains at the same cell concentration. this study shows that the highest diminution of mutagenicity in presence of b[alpha]p (74%) was observed in presence of mgp. the  antimutagenic activity of nearly all the individual probiotic and the mgp were in concordance with the b[alpha]p binding determined by hplc. according to our results, the b[alpha]p binding to probiotic was irreversible still after being washed with dmso solution. the stability of the toxic compounds-bacterial cell binding is a key consideration when probiotic antimutagenic property is evaluated. mgp exhibits the ability to bind and detoxify potent mutagens, and this property can be useful in supplemented foods for goats since it can lead to  the removal of potent mutagens and protect and enhance ruminal health and hence food safety of consumers.

TI  == characterization of some potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from iranian native chickens.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to isolate, identify and characterize new  lab strains with high probiotic potentials from iranian (isfahan) indigenous chickens. from 90 isolated labs, 11 isolates had high growth rate under different stress conditions, including acid (ph 2.5), bile (0.5% oxgall), salt (6-15%) and  temperatures 15 and 45 degrees c, and their aggregation time was less than 120 min. based on the molecular identification using 16s rdna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the isolates belonged to two lactobacillus salivarius and  l. reuteri species. the isolates showed different tolerance to 16 clinically and  veterinary relevant antibiotics, and most of them were resistant to or semi-tolerant of 7-15 different studied antibiotics. the es11, es12, es3 and es13 strains with resistance to or semi-tolerance of 15, 14 and 13 different antibiotics, respectively, were the most tolerant strains. the selected isolates  showed a wide range of antimicrobial activity against 7 different pathogenic strains. all the isolates exhibited antagonistic activity against e. coli, enterococcus hirae, salmonella enterica and staphylococcus aureus. the isolates es6 and es11 with high antagonistic activity and resistance against 6 of the studied pathogens were the most powerful antagonistic isolates. the values and types of adhesion to the caco-2 cell cultures were significantly different (0-40  bacteria/caco-2 cell), and the maximum adhesion was observed for the isolates es6 and es13 with 35 and 40 bacteria adhesion/cell, respectively. finally, based on all the experiments, 7 strains, including es1, es6, es7, es11, es12 and es13, were selected for the further in vivo assays and possible use in the poultry industry.

TI  == adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and s-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
AB  == eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. the inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without s-layer proteins against adherence of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enteritidis 50335 to caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain (lgg) as a positive control. in addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, zn(2+) and cu(2+) were assessed. all five selected strains, lactobacillus salivarius zj614 (jn981856), lactobacillus reuteri zj616 (jn981858), l. reuteri zj617 (jn981859), l. reuteri zj621 (jn981863) and l. reuteri zj623 (jn981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, e. coli k88 and s. enteritidis 50335. l. reuteri zj621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to s. enteritidis 50335 (p < 0.05). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant  bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 kda as well as had a common band of approximately 42 kda. after treatment with 5 m licl to remove s-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (p < 0.05). the results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which s-layer proteins plays an important role.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == glycerol supplementation enhances l. reuteri's protective effect against s. typhimurium colonization in a 3-d model of colonic epithelium.
AB  == the probiotic effects of lactobacillus reuteri have been speculated to partly depend on its capacity to produce the antimicrobial substance reuterin during the reduction of glycerol in the gut. in this study, the potential of this process to protect human intestinal epithelial cells against infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium was investigated. we used a three-dimensional (3-d)  organotypic model of human colonic epithelium that was previously validated and applied to study interactions between s. typhimurium and the intestinal epithelium that lead to enteric salmonellosis. using this model system, we show that l. reuteri protects the intestinal cells against the early stages of salmonella infection and that this effect is significantly increased when l. reuteri is stimulated to produce reuterin from glycerol. more specifically, the reuterin-containing ferment of l. reuteri caused a reduction in salmonella adherence and invasion (1 log unit), and intracellular survival (2 log units). in contrast, the l. reuteri ferment without reuterin stimulated growth of the intracellular salmonella population with 1 log unit. the short-term exposure to reuterin or the reuterin-containing ferment had no observed negative impact on intestinal epithelial cell health. however, long-term exposure (24 h) induced a complete loss of cell-cell contact within the epithelial aggregates and compromised cell viability. collectively, these results shed light on a potential role for reuterin in inhibiting salmonella-induced intestinal infections and may  support the combined application of glycerol and l. reuteri. while future in vitro and in vivo studies of reuterin on intestinal health should fine-tune our understanding of the mechanistic effects, in particular in the presence of a complex gut microbiota, this the first report of a reuterin effect on the enteric infection process in any mammalian cell type.

TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == identification and biological activity of potential probiotic bacterium isolated  from the stomach mucus of breast-fed lamb.
AB  == the lactic acid bacterium e isolated from the stomach mucus of breast-fed lamb was identified by sequencing of 16s rdna fragment and species-specific pcr as lactobacillus reuteri. its potential antimicrobial activity and ability to modulate immune system in vitro and in vivo was determined. the growth inhibition of potential pathogens decreased from staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica ser. minnesota to escherichia coli. the lowest inhibition activity was observed in the case of candida albicans. the ability of  l. reuteri e to modulate biological activities of human and mouse mononuclear cells was estimated in vitro and in vivo, respectively. the production of il-1beta by monocytes in vitro was significantly induced by l. reuteri e (relative activity 2.47). the ability to modulate biological activities of mononuclear cells by living l. reuteri e cells in vitro in comparison to disintegrated l. reuteri e cells in vivo differed. for example lysozyme activity  in vitro was inhibited while in vivo was stimulated (relative activities 0.30 and 1.83, respectively). the peroxidase activity in vitro was stimulated while in vivo was inhibited (relative activities 1.53 and 0.17, respectively). obtained results indicate that l. reuteri e is potential candidate to be used in probiotic preparations for animals and/or human.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == evaluation of antimicrobial activity of probiotic bacteria against salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium 1344 in a common medium under different environmental conditions.
AB  == the importance of probiotics in human nutrition has been gaining recognition in recent years. these organisms have been shown to promote human health by enhancing immunological and digestive functions and fighting respiratory tract infections. we propose an improved in vitro model for the study of probiotic antimicrobial activity against enteropathogens, by attempting to re-create, in a  common culture medium, environmental growth conditions comparable to those present in the small intestine. a preliminary experiment was carried out in order to find a culture medium able to support both probiotics and pathogens. this was  done with the aim of obtaining correct assessment of the interaction under shared growth conditions. bhi medium was selected as the common culture medium and was therefore used in antimicrobial activity assays. the interactions between salmonella 1344 and lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus reuteri were then assessed at different ph and oxygen availability conditions mimicking the small intestinal environment. l. rhamnosus gg atcc 53103 (lgg) had the strongest antimicrobial effect, in particular under anaerobic conditions and at lower ph levels. its antagonistic activity involved both lactic acid and secreted non-lactic acid molecules. our findings suggest that each probiotic strain has an optimum range of action and should therefore be thoroughly investigated to optimize its use.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == like will to like: abundances of closely related species can predict susceptibility to intestinal colonization by pathogenic and commensal bacteria.
AB  == the intestinal ecosystem is formed by a complex, yet highly characteristic microbial community. the parameters defining whether this community permits invasion of a new bacterial species are unclear. in particular, inhibition of enteropathogen infection by the gut microbiota ( = colonization resistance) is poorly understood. to analyze the mechanisms of microbiota-mediated protection from salmonella enterica induced enterocolitis, we used a mouse infection model and large scale high-throughput pyrosequencing. in contrast to conventional mice  (con), mice with a gut microbiota of low complexity (lcm) were highly susceptible to s. enterica induced colonization and enterocolitis. colonization resistance was partially restored in lcm-animals by co-housing with conventional mice for 21 days (lcm(con21)). 16s rrna sequence analysis comparing lcm, lcm(con21) and con gut microbiota revealed that gut microbiota complexity increased upon conventionalization and correlated with increased resistance to s. enterica infection. comparative microbiota analysis of mice with varying degrees of colonization resistance allowed us to identify intestinal ecosystem characteristics associated with susceptibility to s. enterica infection. moreover, this system enabled us to gain further insights into the general principles of gut ecosystem invasion by non-pathogenic, commensal bacteria. mice  harboring high commensal e. coli densities were more susceptible to s. enterica induced gut inflammation. similarly, mice with high titers of lactobacilli were more efficiently colonized by a commensal lactobacillus reuteri(rr) strain after  oral inoculation. upon examination of 16s rrna sequence data from 9 con mice we found that closely related phylotypes generally display significantly correlated  abundances (co-occurrence), more so than distantly related phylotypes. thus, in essence, the presence of closely related species can increase the chance of invasion of newly incoming species into the gut ecosystem. we provide evidence that this principle might be of general validity for invasion of bacteria in preformed gut ecosystems. this might be of relevance for human enteropathogen infections as well as therapeutic use of probiotic commensal bacteria.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  == lactobacillus spp., referred to as ij-1 and ij-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. according to the analyses of 16s rdna sequence, lactobacillus sp. ij-1 showed greater than 99% homology with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016(t), and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 had  greater than 99% homology with the l. gasseri atcc 33323(t) and l. johnsonii atcc 33200(t). the ph changes in the culture media of lactobacillus sp. ij-1 and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. both strains inhibited the growth of  pathogenic microorganisms, such as listeria monocytogenes atcc 19111, salmonella  enterica kctc 12401, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, staphylococcus aureus kctc 3881, and bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.

TI  == isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  == this study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media  (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed lamvab agar). microscopy, the catalase test, gram-staining, and rapd-pcr analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. phenotypic analysis using the api 50 ch test and genotypic analysis of 16s rdna sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. bacterial survival under the conditions of low ph (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v)  of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 33199). the isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, escherichia coli k88 and salmonella typhimurium. the high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as  piglet probiotics.

TI  == structural characterization of a human-type corrinoid adenosyltransferase confirms that coenzyme b12 is synthesized through a four-coordinate intermediate.
AB  == atp:cob(i)alamin adenosyltransferases (acas) catalyze the transfer of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl moiety from atp to the upper axial ligand position of cobalamin  in the synthesis of coenzyme b 12. for the aca-catalyzed reaction to proceed, cob(ii)alamin must be reduced to cob(i)alamin in the enzyme active site. this reduction is facilitated through the generation of a four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin intermediate on the enzyme. we have determined the high-resolution  crystal structure of a human-type aca from lactobacillus reuteri with a four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin bound in the enzyme active site and with the product, adenosylcobalamin, partially occupied in the active site. the assembled  structures represent snapshots of the steps in the aca-catalyzed formation of the cobalt-carbon bond of coenzyme b 12. the structures define the corrinoid binding  site and provide visual evidence for a base-off, four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin intermediate. the complete structural description of aca-mediated catalysis reveals the molecular features of four-coordinate cob(ii)alamin stabilization and provides additional insights into the molecular basis for dysfunction in human patients suffering from methylmalonic aciduria.

AB  == the expression of immune response in the form of leukocytic infiltrate by cd3+, cd4+, and cd8+ cells in the epithelium and in the intestinal lamina propria of chicks was studied in the present work by means of immunohistochemical reaction.  the chicks were treated with lactobacillus spp. or cecal microflora (cm) and experimentally challenged or not with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis. the 320 birds utilized were divided into 4 groups containing 80 chicks each and submitted to treatments with lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus acidophilus, and cm. each group was subdivided into 4 subgroups of  20 birds each and classified into a subgroup that did not receive treatment (negative control), subgroup treated, subgroup treated and challenged with salmonella enteritidis, and subgroup only challenged with salmonella enteritidis  (positive control). the results obtained show that the treatment with l. reuteri, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, or cm and challenged or not with salmonella enteritidis determine immune response in the form of leukocytic infiltrate by cd3+ and cd8+ lymphocytes followed by cd4+ in the epithelium and in the lamina propria of the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum of chicks up to 12 d of age. the quantity of cd3+ lymphocytes was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the intestine of chicks treated with l. acidophilus or cm and challenged or not with salmonella enteritidis; however, the higher quantity of cd8+ lymphocytes was in the intestine of chicks treated with cm and challenged with salmonella enteritidis. the duodenum was the segment in which the immune response by t cells (cd3+, cd4+, and cd8+) was stimulated with the greatest intensity, followed by, respectively,  the jejunum and cecum. the quantity of cd3+ lymphocytes present in the duodenum,  jejunum, and cecum increases with the age of chicks, independent of the stimulus  determined by treatments or challenge.

TI  == human-derived probiotic lactobacillus reuteri demonstrate antimicrobial activities targeting diverse enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri is a commensal-derived anaerobic probiotic that resides in  the human gastrointestinal tract. l. reuteri converts glycerol into a potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound, reuterin, which inhibits the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we compared four human-derived l. reuteri isolates (atcc 55730, atcc pta 6475, atcc pta 4659 and atcc pta 5289) in their ability to produce reuterin and to inhibit the growth of  different enteric pathogens in vitro. reuterin was produced by each of the four l. reuteri strains and assessed for biological activity. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of reuterin derived from each strain was determined for the following enteric pathogens: enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic  e. coli, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei and vibrio cholerae. we also analyzed the relative abilities of l. reuteri to inhibit enteric pathogens in a pathogen overlay assay. the magnitude of reuterin production did not directly correlate with the relative ability of l. reuteri to suppress the proliferation of enteric pathogens. additional antimicrobial factors may be produced by l. reuteri, and multiple factors may act synergistically with reuterin to inhibit enteric pathogens.

TI  == isolation and characterization of lactobacillus species having potential for use  as probiotic cultures for dogs.
AB  == the need to control pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract of dogs is  a growing concern. there is interest in using probiotics such as species of lactobacillus to help control canine intestinal infections. for successful use as a probiotic, the bacterial species should be of canine intestinal origin since these species exhibit host specificity. serial dilutions of freshly voided dog feces were plated on lactobacillus selection (lbs) agar to isolate the cultures.  isolates were identified based on gram stain, catalase test, and fermentation patterns using api 50 ch kits. all potential isolates were compared for bile resistance based on relative ability to grow in broth containing 0.3% oxgall, the ability to inhibit salmonella typhimurium in associative broth cultures, and the  production of reuterin. of the lactobacilli isolated, lactobacillus reuteri was the dominant species. however, some cultures of l. acidophilus also were isolated. we found variations among the isolates of l. reuteri and l. acidophilus with respect to bile tolerance. in general, isolates of l. reuteri appeared to be more bile resistant than were isolates of l. acidophilus. there were also variations in the ability to inhibit growth of s. typhimurium. some isolates of l. reuteri produced reuterin while others did not.

TI  == specific bifidobacterium strains isolated from elderly subjects inhibit growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cell-free, ph-controlled supernatants of thirty-eight bifidobacterium strains isolated from healthy elderly subjects were subjected to antimicrobial activity assay. bioluminescent indicator strains staphylococcus aureus rn4220, escherichia coli k-12, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028 were used as targets of antimicrobial activity. the effect of nutrient depletion on the inhibition was eliminated with spent-culture controls. three out of thirty-eight  bifidobacterium strains were capable of inhibiting the growth of s. aureus. the inhibition was equal to 23.2+/-19.1% to 50.4+/-26.7% of the inhibition caused by  50 iu/ml nisin. reuterin-producing positive strain lactobacillus reuteri sd2112 was capable of 86.0+/-24.6% inhibition, but bifidobacterium lactis bb-12, a known probiotic strain, showed no inhibition. none of the strains was capable of inhibiting the growth of e. coli or s. enterica. the observed inhibition by bifidobacteria was related to hydrogen peroxide formation and possible production of heat-stable proteinaceous compounds. the results suggest that production of antimicrobial substances other than organic acids is not common among bifidobacterium strains typical of elderly subjects. however, specific strains were identified which showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. aureus.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control salmonella enteritidis.
AB  == aims: to select lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control salmonella enteritidis infection. methods and results: one hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. all isolates belonged to the lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri or lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the l. reuteri group being the most predominant group. based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. salmonella inhibition  was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. a selection of strains was evaluated in a s. enteritidis challenge experiment. two strains, l. reuteri r-17485 and lactobacillus johnsonii r-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by s. enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. conclusions: lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the s. enteritidis colonization of chicks. significance and impact of the study: the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic  potential in reducing s. enteritidis infection.

TI  == effects of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, or serovar choleraesuis, lactobacillus reuteri and bacillus licheniformis on chemokine and cytokine expression in the swine jejunal epithelial cell line, ipec-j2.
AB  == direct-fed microbials, including lactobacillus and bacillus spp., are potential replacements for low dose in-feed antibiotics for swine and other livestock. to understand the function of these microbes in the gut, the current study used pig  jejunal epithelial cells (ipec-j2) to evaluate how lactobacillus reuteri (lr) and bacillus licheniformis (bl) differed from salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium (st) or choleraesuis (sc) in their ability to regulate, stimulate, or modify the proinflammatory mediators, interleukin 8 (il8), cc chemokine 20 (ccl20), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha). to optimize the positive control to drive il8 secretion by ipec-j2 cells, cells were treated apically with various concentrations of st (versus control (ctl)) for 1h, followed by a wash. media containing gentamicin was added and collected at 6h post-treatment. compared to ctl, 10(8) st produced maximal il8 secretion in both the apical and basolateral directions, with significant basolateral polarization (p<0.0001). we  next evaluated the time course of il8 secretion, and il8, ccl20, and tnfalpha mrna expression by ipec-j2 cells treated apically with 10(8) st, sc, lr, and bl versus ctl. media and rna were collected at 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 h post treatment. only st stimulated an increase in il8 secretion at any time point, with increases in il8 mrna at both 3 and 6h (p<0.05). however, bl increased il8 mrna at 1.5h (p<0.0001). neither lr nor sc affected il8 mrna expression. ccl20 mrna was strongly upregulated by st (p<0.05) and bl (1.5 and 3.0 h; p<0.05), but not lr or sc. only st increased tnfalpha mrna relative to ctl (p<0.05). two experiments were conducted to determine if pre-exposure of ipec-j2 cells to lr or bl modified st induced il8 secretion. confluent cells were treated apically overnight with various levels of lr or bl (in separate experiments) followed by st challenge. media were collected at 4 (lr experiment) or 5h (bl experiment) post st. in the lr study, il8 secretion was increased by st as compared to ctl (p<0.0001), reduced by lr (p<0.05), and lr+st co-treatments failed to alter st stimulated secretion. in the bl experiment, secretion of il8 was increased by st (p<0.0001), but blunted basolaterally in bl+st co-treated wells. the data demonstrate that ipec-j2 cells increase il8 secretion in response to st, and il8 mrna in response  to st and bl, but not lr. furthermore, st stimulated secretion of il8 is inhibited basolaterally in the presence of bl.

TI  == selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
AB  == thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), lactobacillus mucosae (7), lactobacillus plantarum (6), lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), lactobacillus rossiae (2), lactobacillus ultunensis (2), lactobacillus crispatus (2), and lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna. all isolates were detected at 8-9 log cfu g(-1). preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees c for 10 s). the decrease in viability for some l. reuteri, l. mucosae, l. plantarum, l. kitasatonis, and l. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. selected strains were further characterized for acid and  bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. except for l. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. antibacterial activity was found against gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. l. reuteri 8.1, 3s7, 6.2, and 1.2, l. mucosae 1.1r, l. plantarum 4.1, and l. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. after pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log cfu kg(-1) of lactobacilli. l. plantarum 4.1, and l.  reuteri 3s7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. the findings in this study provide a  strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.

TI  == live lactobacillus rhamnosus [corrected] is essential for the inhibitory effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced interleukin-8 expression.
AB  == the mechanism of the apparent anti-inflammatory action of probiotic organisms is  unclear. lactobacillus reuteri is effective in inhibiting colitis in interleukin-10 (il-10)-deficient mice. nerve growth factor (ngf), in addition to  its activity on neuronal cell growth, has significant anti-inflammatory effects in several experimental systems in vitro and in vivo, including a model of colitis. our experiments were designed to explore the mechanism of effect of l. reuteri in the human epithelial cell lines t84 and ht29 on cytokine and ngf synthesis and il-8 response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). epithelial cells were cultured for various times with live and killed l. reuteri  and examined by reverse transcription-pcr for ngf, il-10, and tnf-alpha-induced il-8 expression. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate intracellular il-8 and secreted product. western blotting and confocal microscopy were used to determine the effects on ikappab and nf-kappab, respectively. live but not heat-killed or gamma-irradiated l. reuteri upregulated ngf and dose dependently inhibited constitutive synthesis by t84 and ht29 cells of il-8 and that induced by tnf-alpha in terms of mrna and intracellular and secreted protein. similarly, l. reuteri inhibited il-8 synthesis induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. l. reuteri required preincubation and adherence for effect, inhibited translocation of nf-kappab to the nuclei of hela cells, and prevented degradation of ikappab. neither cellular lysates nor media supernatants had any effect on tnf-alpha-induced il-8. the conclusion is that l. reuteri has potent direct anti-inflammatory activity on human epithelial cells, which is likely to be related to the activity of ingested probiotics. l. reuteri also upregulates an unusual anti-inflammatory molecule, ngf, and inhibits nf-kappab translocation to the nucleus.

TI  == modulation of anti-pathogenic activity in canine-derived lactobacillus species by carbohydrate growth substrate.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of various carbon sources on the production of extracellular antagonistic compounds against two escherichia coli strains and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium by three canine-derived lactobacilli strains. methods and materials: cell-free preparations, ph neutralized, were used in antibiotic disc experiments as an initial screening. the bacteria/carbohydrate combinations that showed inhibition of the growth of those pathogens, were further investigated in batch co-culture experiments. the cell-free supernatants  of the cultures, that decreased the population number of the pathogens in the co-culture experiments to log cfu ml-1 <or= 4, were tested for inhibition of the  pathogens in pure cultures at neutral and acidic ph. conclusions: the results showed that the substrate seems to affect the production of antimicrobial compounds and this effect could not just be ascribed to the ability of the bacteria to grow in the various carbon sources. l. mucosae, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, when grown in sugar mixtures consisting of alpha-glucosides (degree of polymerization (dp) 1-4) could produce antimicrobial compounds active against all three pathogens in vitro. this effect could not be attributed to a single ingredient of those sugar mixtures and was synergistic. this inhibition had a dose-response characteristic and was more active at acidic ph. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of the effect that the carbon source has on the production of antimicrobial compounds by gut-associated lactobacilli allows the rational design of prebiotic/probiotic combinations to combat gastrointestinal pathogens.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri crl1098 produces cobalamin.
AB  == we found that lactobacillus reuteri crl1098, a lactic acid bacterium isolated from sourdough, is able to produce cobalamin. the sugar-glycerol cofermentation in vitamin b(12)-free medium showed that this strain was able to reduce glycerol  through a well-known cobalamin-dependent reaction with the formation of 1,3-propanediol as a final product. the cell extract of l. reuteri corrected the  coenzyme b12 requirement of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis atcc 7830 and allowed the growth of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (mete cbib) and escherichia coli (mete) in minimal medium. preliminary genetic studies of cobalamin biosynthesis genes from l. reuteri allowed the identification of cob genes which encode the coba, cbij, and cbik enzymes involved in the cobalamin pathway. the cobamide produced by l. reuteri, isolated in its cyanide form by using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, showed a uv-visible spectrum identical to that of standard cyanocobalamin (vitamin b12).

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of food-borne pathogens to caco-2 cells by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == aims: to select adhesive strains among strains of lactobacillus and to apply them to inhibit adhesion of food-borne pathogens. methods and results: twelve lactobacillus strains (10 from intestine) were examined for adhesion using caco-2 cell cultures. the two most adhesive strains, lactobacillus crispatus jcm 8779 and lact. reuteri jcm 1081, were used to test antiadhesion activity against enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and enterococcus faecalis strains. adhesion of the pathogens was inhibited by both lactobacillus strains. adhesion of ent. faecalis was especially strongly inhibited by jcm 8779. although antimicrobial activity was not detected in the culture supernatant fluid by agar well diffusion assay, the supernatant fluid obtained from the harvested jcm 8779 cell suspension showed bactericidal activity against ent. faecalis. conclusion: the strong antiadhesion activity of jcm 8779 against ent. faecalis appears to be due to the combined effect of both bactericidal activity and competition for attachment site. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report that lact. crispatus produces a bactericidal substance.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
