TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis and Capnocytophaga ochracea are antagonists for human toll-like receptor 4.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. To investigate the roles of TLRs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both TLR2- and TLR4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human CD14 and TLRs. When the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, Escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced NF-kappaB-dependent CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR2 cells. Although freeze-dried A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, and E. coli also induced CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells, freeze-dried P. gingivalis did not. Similarly, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, and E. coli induced CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells, but LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea did not. Furthermore, LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea attenuated CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells induced by repurified LPS from E. coli. LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from U373 cells, the secretion of IL-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and ICAM-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified LPS from E. coli. These findings indicated that LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea worked as antagonists for human TLR4. The antagonistic activity of LPS from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Induction of anti-thymocyte/T lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - We examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/T lymphocyte autoantibody (ATA) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from periodontopathic bacteria; Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral Escherichia coli. All of the LPS induced IgM-ATA. Among these, LPS from C. ochracea induced the highest level of IgM-ATA, whereas that of P. gingivalis induced the lowest. The peritoneal T lymphocytes of mice injected with LPS were bound by IgM-ATA. Peritoneal B-1 (CD5+B) cells stimulated by each LPS produced much more IgM-ATA than splenic B-2 (CD5-B) cells, suggesting that B-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. Serum of mice injected with C. ochracea and F. nucleatum LPS showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. Binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by IgM purified from serum of the mice injected with C. ochracea LPS. Furthermore, serum of mice treated with C. ochracea, F. nucleatum or A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. However, purified IgM from the serum of mice treated with C. ochracea LPS failed to produce the same inhibition. Our results suggest that LPS from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce IgM-ATA in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.
TI  - Extracts of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  - In order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as Escherichia coli on bone formation, clone MC3T3-E1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. The addition of the sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. By contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus sanguis, and Escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. The addition of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. Polymyxin B did not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. The inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kDa eluted from Sephadex G-200 column. The inhibitory substances of Prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results indicate that Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that of non-smokers. The study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The differences in bacterial counts using the Mann Whitney U test were statistically significant for Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena and Candida albicans in smokers. Statistically significant differences for Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Eubacterium lentum and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like E. coli, C. albicans and S. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Secretion of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. It was recently demonstrated that PMN have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. We therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-8 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) secreted by PMN from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium Escherichia coli. A actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and E. coli LPS stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-8 than the control unstimulated PMN (p < 0.01). The levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-8 released from cells stimulated with P. gingivalis or C. ochracea LPS were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans or E. coli LPS (p < 0.05). On the other hand, substantially greater amounts of IL-1ra were released from PMN stimulated with each LPS and from control unstimulated PMN during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of IL-1ra were secreted by PMN stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans and E.coli LPS during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). The inhibitory effects of IL-1ra on the biological activity of IL-1 in the supernatants of PMN were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. The supernatants of PMN stimulated with each LPS showed less biological IL-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human IL-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of PMN stimulated with P. gingivalis or C. ochracea LPS. These findings demonstrated that LPS from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating PMN to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as IL-1ra. Different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various LPS might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. In the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt A gene of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp A gene of Treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. These gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the PCR assays. Primers for P. gingivalis detected P. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of Capnocytophaga, 3 species of Prevotella, 2 species of Porphyromonas other than P. gingivalis, Bacteroides levii, Escherichia coli, 3 strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of T. denticola. PCR analysis using primers for the lkt A gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Primers selected from the tdp A gene of T. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except T. denticola serovars a, b, and c. Thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either P. gingivalis (33277), A. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717 and 43718) or T. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). The PCR assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from various Capnocytophaga strains possess potent Limulus amoebocyte lysate clotting activity.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were extracted by the hot phenol-water method from three ATCC strains (C. sputigena ATCC 33612, C. ochracea ATCC 33596, and C. gingivalis ATCC 33624) and three clinical isolates (C. sputigena TE-1, C. ochracea ONO-26, and C. gingivalis M-12). Endospecy was used to determine the Limulus amoebocyte lysate clotting activities. The activities of LPSs from Capnocytophaga strains were stronger than those of Escherichia coli, with the exception of the LPS from C. gingivalis M-12. Except for the LPS from C. sputigena TE-1, the SDS-PAGE analyses of these preparations showed slow-migrating and repeating ladder bands similar to the LPSs of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium (wild type) and included both the core-lipid A region and various lengths of O-antigen. The LPS from C. sputigena TE-1 possessed fast-migrating bands and did not have an O-side chain.
