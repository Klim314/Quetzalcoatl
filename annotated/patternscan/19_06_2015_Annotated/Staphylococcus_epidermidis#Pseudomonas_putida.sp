TI  == variation in bacterial atp concentration during rapid changes in extracellular ph and implications for the activity of attached bacteria.
AB  == in this study we investigated the relationship between a rapid change in extracellular ph and the alteration of bacterial atp concentration. this relationship is a key component of a hypothesis indicating that bacterial bioenergetics - the creation of atp from adp via a proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane - can be altered by the physiochemical charge-regulation effect, which results in a ph shift at the bacteria's surface upon adhesion to another surface. the bacterial atp concentration was measured during a rapid change in extracellular ph from a baseline ph of 7.2 to ph values between 3.5 and 10.5. experiments were conducted with four neutrophilic bacterial strains, including the gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida and the gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis. a change in bulk  ph produced an immediate response in bacterial atp, demonstrating a direct link between changes in extracellular ph and cellular bioenergetics. in general, the shifts in atp were similar across the four bacterial strains, with results following an exponential relationship between the extracellular ph and cellular atp concentration. one exception occurred with s. epidermidis, where there was no variation in cellular atp at acidic ph values, and this finding is consistent with this species' ability to thrive under acidic conditions. these results provide insight into obtaining a desired bioenergetic response in bacteria through (i) the application of chemical treatments to vary the local ph and (ii)  the selection and design of surfaces resulting in local ph modification of attached bacteria via the charge-regulation effect.

TI  == quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion using surface free energy determined with a spectrophotometric method.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto solid surfaces is of importance in a wide spectrum of problems, including environmental microbiology, biomedical research, and various  industrial applications. despite many research efforts, present thermodynamic models that rely on the evaluation of the adhesion energy are often elusive in predicting the bacterial adhesion behavior. here, we developed a new spectrophotometric method to determine the surface free energy (sfe) of bacterial cells. the adhesion behaviors of five bacterial species, pseudomonas putida kt2440, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and escherichia coli dh5alpha, onto two model substratum surfaces, i.e., clean glass and silanized glass surfaces, were studied. we found that bacterial adhesion was unambiguously mediated by the sfe difference between the bacterial cells and the solid substratum. the lower the sfe difference, the higher degree of bacterial adhesion. we therefore propose the use of the sfe difference as an accurate and simple thermodynamic measure for quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion. the methodological advance and thermodynamic simplification in the paper have implications in controlling bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on solid surfaces.

TI  == effects of shear on initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems.
AB  == initial bacterial attachment, likely affected by local shear, could influence biofilm formation. however, there are contradictory reports for the shear effects on attachment of different bacteria onto different surfaces. in this study, four  bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli, were examined for their attachment to glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (ots) modified glass under different shears. polystyrene particles were used to verify that their shear dependent attachment on glass and  ots could be interpreted using an analysis based on the extended derjaguin-landau-verwey-overbeek (xdlvo) theory. in particular, the critical shear force (f(c-shear)) could correlate with the maximum attractive force (f(max)(xdlvo)) toward the secondary energy minimum as f(c-shear)=cf(max)(xdlvo). for these particles, c of ~1 was obtained, the value was within the coefficient range (0.1-1) of substances sliding over glass. for s. epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa on glass, c was 0.3, <0.6 and 0.2, respectively. when considering potential protein adsorption on ots during bacterial attachment, c of these species on ots was slightly above 1. a greatly enhanced attachment of p. aeruginosa on ots was also observed, probably due to the presence of flagella. for p. putida, the attachment first decreased slightly or maintained with shear and then increased. such behaviors were probably caused by the increased secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) at higher shears by p. putida. the results from this study suggested that, without complications from surface features/eps, the analysis based on the xdlvo theory could provide a basis for understanding shear effect on initial bacterial attachment.

TI  == effect of rhamnolipids on initial attachment of bacteria on glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified glass.
AB  == bacterial attachment on solid surfaces has various implications in environmental, industrial and medical applications. in this study, the effects of rhamnolipid biosurfactants on initial attachment of bacteria on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane (ots) modified glass were evaluated under continuous-flow conditions. the bacteria investigated were three gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli, and two gram-positive species staphylcoccus epidermidis and bacillus subtilis. rhamnolipids, at 10 and 200 mg/l, significantly reduced the attachment of all but s. epidermidis on both glass and ots-modified glass. for s. epidermidis rhamnolipids reduced the attachment on ots-modified glass but not on glass. studies were further done to identify the mechanism(s) by which rhamnolipids reduced the cell attachment. the following potential properties of rhamnolipids were investigated: inhibition of microbial growth, change of cell surface hydrophobicity, easier detachment of cells already attached to substratum, and modification of substratum surface properties. results showed that rhamnolipids were ineffective for the latter two effects. rhamnolipids, up to 200mg/l, inhibited the growth of b. subtilis, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa pao1 but not the growth of e. coli, p. putida and p. aeruginosa e0340. also, rhamnolipids  tended to increase the hydrophobicity of p. aeruginosa pao1 and e. coli, decrease the hydrophobicity of p. putida and s. epidermidis, and have no clear effect on the hydrophobicity of b. subtillis. these trends however did not correlate with the observed trend of cell attachment reduction. the responsible mechanism(s) remained unknown.

TI  == detection of pyrogens adsorbed to intraocular lenses: evaluation of limulus amoebocyte lysate and in vitro pyrogen tests.
AB  == purpose: to determine the ability of the limulus amoebocyte lysate (lal) assay and the in vitro pyrogen test (ipt) to detect pyrogens adsorbed to intraocular lenses (iols). setting: berlin eye research institute, berlin, germany. methods:  fifteen of each of the following iols were used: microsil ms 612 asp, acrysof sa60at, superflex, sensar, xact, and ls-106 iols. the challenge organism suspensions were 10(3) cfu/ml and 10(4) cfu/ml escherichia coli, 10(3) cfu/ml and 10(4) cfu/ml pseudomonas putida, and 10(5) cfu/ml and 10(6) cfu/ml staphylococcus epidermidis. two iols of each model were incubated at room temperature for at least 2 days in 0.6 ml of 1 of the suspensions. they were then gamma sterilized.  the extract of 1 iol was tested with the lal assay; the other iol was tested with the ipt. results: the lal was negative for all incubated iols. the ipt was positive for all iols incubated in e coli and p putida suspensions, with the microsil ms 612 asp, acrysof sa60at, xact, and ls-106 iols showing a severe reaction. the superflex and sensar iols had a slight to moderate response for lower bacterial concentrations and a moderate to severe response for higher concentrations. for s epidermidis, all iols showed a slight ipt response except xact iols, which showed a nonpyrogenic response. conclusions: results indicate that the lal test may fail to detect pyrogens adsorbed to iols and the ipt reliably detects pyrogens with a dose-dependent response. this has relevance in the investigation of toxic anterior segment syndrome outbreaks.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == microbiological study of cosmetic products during their use by consumers: health  risk and efficacy of preservative systems.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the microbial contamination of 91 cosmetics (23 o/w emulsions, 47 tensiolytes, 21 aqueous pastes) in three different states of use (intact, in-use, ending product) and the protection efficacy of the preservative systems most frequently used in the analysed cosmetic formulations. methods and results:  total bacterial count, isolation and identification of pathogenic isolates were performed on the collected cosmetics. about 10.6% of tensiolytes (13.5% bath foam, 6.7% shampoo, 10% liquid soaps) were contaminated by staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas putida. the efficacy of the preservative systems of two cosmetic products, tested against standard micro-organisms (staphylococcus aureus atcc 4338 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc  9027) and two isolates from cosmetics in this study (s. epidermidis and p. putida), satisfied the cosmetics, toiletries, and fragrance association and official italian pharmacopeia criteria, while only one tested cosmetic respected  the rapid challenge test criterion. conclusions: contaminated cosmetic products are relatively uncommon, but some products, unable to suppress the growth of several micro-organisms, represent a potential health hazard. significance and impact of the study: the challenge test may be performed not only during the preparation of the preservative system in the intact cosmetics, but also be used  to evaluate the protection efficacy during their use.

TI  == biofilm formation by escherichia coli is stimulated by synergistic interactions and co-adhesion mechanisms with adherence-proficient bacteria.
AB  == laboratory strains of escherichia coli do not show significant ability to attach  to solid surfaces and to form biofilms. we compared the adhesion properties of the e. coli phl565 laboratory strain to eight environmental e. coli isolates: only four isolates displayed adhesion properties to glass significantly higher than phl565. the ability of the adhesion-proficient isolates to attach to glass tubes strongly correlated with their ability to express curli (thin aggregative fimbriae), thus suggesting that curli are a common adhesion determinant in environmental strains. despite its inability to attach to solid surfaces, growth  of e. coli phl565 in mixed cultures with pseudomonas putida mt2 resulted in co-adhesion and in formation of a mixed e. coli/p. putida biofilm, which was able to colonize glass surfaces with dramatic efficiency compared to p. putida alone.  e. coli/p. putida interactions stimulate initial adhesion to glass, and the presence of both bacterial species in the mature biofilm was confirmed by quantitative pcr. in contrast, no synergistic biofilm formation was observed in mixed cultures of e. coli with the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus epidermidis. interestingly, e. coli phl565 also stimulated biofilm formation by bacterial communities isolated from drinking water distribution systems. our results strongly suggest that co-adhesion and synergistic interaction with biofilm-forming species might represent an important mechanism, and a possible alternative strategy to production of adhesion determinants, for persistence and  propagation of e. coli in the environment.

TI  == a comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == contamination of diagnostic ophthalmic solutions in primary eye care settings.
AB  == pharmaceutical agents and irrigating solutions are widely used in both optometric and ophthalmologic practices. contamination of these containers or solutions could possibly pose some risk of infection to a patient. we set out to investigate the possible contamination of a representative sample of these containers in small office practices. representative bottles of two diagnostic pharmaceutical agents and an irrigating solution were obtained from primary care  optometric and ophthalmologic practices in the san francisco-oakland bay area. these bottles were tested to investigate the rate of contamination and to identify the types of microorganisms in the contaminated solutions. sixty total samples (proparacaine, tropicamide, and an irrigating solution) were randomly cultured, and 11.7% of the samples showed contamination. pseudomonas cepacia, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas putida, and streptococcus species were the predominant organisms isolated from the contaminated bottles. in addition, 17 of the original 60 containers were further cultured for investigation of the dried residue particles around the threads of the containers. of these 17 containers, 13 (76.5%) tested positive for staphylococcus and micrococcus species.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
