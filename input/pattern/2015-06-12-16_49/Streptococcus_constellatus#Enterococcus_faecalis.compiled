TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. This study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with CP. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with CP in the United States. The samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/L, clindamycin at 4 mg/L, doxycycline at 4 mg/L, and metronidazole at 16 mg/L, with a post hoc combination of data for amoxicillin and metronidazole. Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. RESULTS: Overall, 74.2% of the patients with CP revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. One or more test species, most often Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, or Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with CP, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either S. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CP in the United States frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. The wide variability found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with CP.
TI  - Alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. Bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched Brain Heart Infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (BHI-blood agar), adjusted to pH 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. Incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic glove box. Bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched BHI broth adjusted to pH 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. Polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and 16S rDNA sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. In the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. Bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard BHI-blood agars (pH 7.0) were used. Of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at pH 9.0 and 4 at pH 10.0. The alkali-resistant strains included Enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), Enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), Fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), Klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), Streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), Streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and Streptococcus mitis (2 strains). Three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus Firmicutes or Staphylococcus at the genus level. The present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at pH 9.0 and/or pH 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus Enterococcus.
TI  - Actinomyces species, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Actinomyces species,  streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. Samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. DNA was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial DNA in clinical samples. All root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, Actinomyces species in 9.4%, and E. faecalis in 7.5%. The most prevalent species were members of the Streptococcus anginosus group. With regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most prevalent species were S. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), E. faecalis (11.5%), and S. anginosus (7.7%). S. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). The other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were A. gerencseriae (14.8%), S. gordonii (11.1%), S. intermedius (11.1%), A. israelii (7.4%), S. anginosus (7.4%), and S. sanguis (7.4%). S. constellatus was the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).
TI  - Serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. Refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. Successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. Periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. Baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. Significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. Some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. On average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. Differences in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). The data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons). Serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel Neisseria sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. High levels of serum antibody to a Microbacterium lacticum-like organism, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and Haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. Baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the Mann-Whitney test. Most of the 40 species tested, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. Prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of Streptococcus species, particularly Streptococcus constellatus. The odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if S. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the total DNA probe count. Since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using DNA probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized subgingival species. The remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences. Many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as Acinetobacter baumanni, Gemella haemolysans, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus warneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera Bartonella, Ralstonia, Neisseria, Eubacterium, Rothia, Gordona, Gemella, Corynebacterium, Leptotrichia, and Actinomyces. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. As a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of S. constellatus were found.
TI  - [Evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the Enterococcus genus].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in NaCl esculin broth and group D antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the Enterococcus genus were performed. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 E. faecium, 3 E. avium, 16 Streptococcus intermedius, 7 S. salivarius, 4 S. bovis, 4 S. constellatus, 2 S. sanguis and 1 strain of S. equinus, S. mitis, S. uberis and S. mutans were studied. The tests used were: rapid test in NaCl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup D streptococcus agglutination (Patho Dx Strep D/PYR; Diagnostic Product Corporation). All catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the Enterococcus genus. The usefulness of Gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. RESULTS: The results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. No significant differences were observed between the results obtained with Gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the Streptococcus mutans strain. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group D agglutination and rapid test in NaCl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus.
TI  - Cell surface hydrophobicity of group D and viridans streptococci isolated from patients with septicaemia.
AB  - Sixty-three strains of Group D streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and API Strep. Streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. constellatus (S. milleri). One of the two isolates of S. faecium was a contamination. The reported increasing frequency of this organism and other Group D and viridans streptococci as well as the association of S. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. Pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (SAT) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. In the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. The surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.
