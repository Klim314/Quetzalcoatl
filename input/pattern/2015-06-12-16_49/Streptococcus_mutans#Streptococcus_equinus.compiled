TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemokine CXCL10 for Dermal and Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - CXCL10 (IP-10) is a small 10 kDa chemokine with antimicrobial activity. It is induced by IFN-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of T cells. Recently, we detected CXCL10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. In the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that CXCL10 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium striatum, and Candida albicans HMV4C, but not Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Poryphromonas gingivalis, or C. albicans ATCC 64124. The reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. However, antimicrobial activity of CXCL10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues, 7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pI of 9.93. Modeling studies revealed that CXCL10 contains an alpha-helix at the N-terminal, three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the C-terminal. Thus, CXCL10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.
TI  - Comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpB genotyping and 2 MALDI-TOF systems.
AB  - Streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. This study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpB gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, MALDI Biotyper (Bruker) and VITEK MS IVD (bioMerieux). Blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. The 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the Anginosus, Bovis, and Mutans groups or identified as Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, or Streptococcus sanguinis. None of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, or Streptococcus tigurinus. In 7 isolates classified to the Mitis group, the rnpB sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of sodA and groEL genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified Streptococcus spp.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the bacterial genus Streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  - Members of the genus Streptococcus within the phylum Firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. This genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic approaches, DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. It is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". However, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. We use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of Streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. Genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. Population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including Pyogenic, Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups, and the other including Mitis, Anginosus and Unknown groups. Phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. Distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. We suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.
TI  - Insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (HTP) family in Streptococcus.
AB  - The Histidine Triad Proteins (HTPs), also known as Pht proteins in Streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. Although many studies have revealed the importance of HTPs in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. In this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. By further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. First, htp genes originated earlier than the Streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups. Second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of Streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. Third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp I and htp II. Although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in Streptococcus suis, htp II members are distinct from htp I due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the C-terminus. Finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. Specifically, the regions outside the HTP domains are under strong positive selection. This distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped Streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.
TI  - Early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group Streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  - The development of high-level daptomycin resistance (HLDR; MIC of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (VGS) isolates. Our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of HLDR after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of VGS and Streptococcus bovis; to determine whether HLDR also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus mitis strain S. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of HLDR in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies were performed with 114 VGS strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 Streptococcus bovis strains isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. HLDR was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of S. mitis isolates, 47% of S. oralis isolates, and 13% of S. sanguis isolates. In our experimental model, HLDR was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. In vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against S. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the MIC and prevented the development of HLDR. In vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented HLDR in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. Daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. In conclusion, HLDR develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. Combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of HLDR in most cases.
TI  - The cryptic competence pathway in Streptococcus pyogenes is controlled by a peptide pheromone.
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer is an important means of bacterial evolution that is facilitated by transduction, conjugation, and natural genetic transformation. Transformation occurs after bacterial cells enter a state of competence, where naked DNA is acquired from the extracellular environment. Induction of the competent state relies on signals that activate master regulators, causing the expression of genes involved in DNA uptake, processing, and recombination. All streptococcal species contain the master regulator SigX and SigX-dependent effector genes required for natural genetic transformation; however, not all streptococcal species have been shown to be naturally competent. We recently demonstrated that competence development in Streptococcus mutans requires the type II ComRS quorum-sensing circuit, comprising an Rgg transcriptional activator and a novel peptide pheromone (L. Mashburn-Warren, D. A. Morrison, and M. J. Federle, Mol. Microbiol. 78:589-606, 2010). The type II ComRS system is shared by the pyogenic, mutans, and bovis streptococci, including the clinically relevant pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Here, we describe the activation of sigX by a small-peptide pheromone and an Rgg regulator of the type II ComRS class. We confirm previous reports that SigX is functional and able to activate sigX-dependent gene expression within the competence regulon, and that SigX stability is influenced by the cytoplasmic protease ClpP. Genomic analyses of available S. pyogenes genomes revealed the presence of intact genes within the competence regulon. While this is the first report to show natural induction of sigX, S. pyogenes remained nontransformable under laboratory conditions. Using radiolabeled DNA, we demonstrate that transformation is blocked at the stage of DNA uptake.
TI  - Exploring internal features of 16S rRNA gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. The genus has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. The present study was taken up to explore 16S rRNA gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus Streptococcus. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the isolates of S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus and S. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The framework based analysis was used to segregate Streptococcus spp. previously identified upto genus level. This segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: The markers generated exploring 16S rRNA gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - A novel double-tryptophan peptide pheromone controls competence in Streptococcus  spp. via an Rgg regulator.
AB  - All streptococcal genomes encode the alternative sigma factor SigX and 21 SigX-dependent proteins required for genetic transformation, yet no pyogenic streptococci are known to develop competence. Resolving this paradox may depend on understanding the regulation of sigX. We report the identification of a regulatory circuit linked to the sigX genes of mutans, pyogenic, and bovis streptococci that uses a novel small, double-tryptophan-containing sigX-inducing peptide (XIP) pheromone. In all three groups, the XIP gene (comS), and sigX have identical, non-canonical promoters consisting of 9 bp inverted repeats separated from a -10 hexamer by 19 bp. comS is adjacent to a gene encoding a putative transcription factor of the Rgg family and is regulated by its product, which we designate ComR. Deletion of comR or comS in Streptococcus mutans abolished transformability, as did deletion of the oligopeptide permease subunit oppD, suggesting that XIP is imported. Providing S. mutans with synthetic fragments of ComS revealed that seven C-terminal residues, including the WW motif, cause robust induction of both sigX and the competent state. We propose that this circuit is the proximal regulator of sigX in S. mutans, and we infer that it controls competence in a parallel way in all pyogenic and bovis streptococci.
TI  - Activity of solvent extracts of Prosopis spicigera, Zingiber officinale and Trachyspermum ammi against multidrug resistant bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emerging trends of multidrug resistance among several groups of microorganisms against different classes of antibiotics led different researchers to develop efficient drugs from plant sources to counter multidrug resistant strains. This study investigated different solvent extracts of Prosopis spicigera (P. Spicigera), Zingiber officinale, and Trachyspermum ammi (T. ammi) to determine their efficacy against multidrug resistant microbes. METHODOLOGY: Successive extractions of these plants were performed using a Soxhlet apparatus, using solvents with increasing polarities. Preliminary phytochemical analysis was also performed. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by a two-fold serial dilution method followed by determination of minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration. Multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Escherichia coli and reference strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus bovis were used in the study. RESULTS: The ethanolic fraction of P. spicigera (least minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] - 4.88 microg/ml) demonstrated a remarkable inhibition of the microorganisms while fractions obtained from those of Zingiber officinale (least MIC-78.125 microg/ml) exhibited little activity. The petroleum ether fraction of T. ammi (least MIC- 625 microg/ml) showed best activity when compared to its other fractions. Qualitative analysis of the phytoconstituents was also performed. CONCLUSIONS: The potency shown by these extracts recommends their use against multidrug resistant microorganisms. This study also showed that P. spicigera could be a potential source of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Infective Endocarditis: Identification of Catalase-Negative, Gram-Positive Cocci  from Blood Cultures by Partial 16S rRNA Gene Analysis and by Vitek 2 Examination.
AB  - Streptococci, enterococci and Streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. Viridans streptococci (VS) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. Vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. STRAINS ORIGINATED FROM TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. Of the 330 strains, based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were VS strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were E. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci. Among VS strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same VS group. Non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.Only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. Most VS strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. Pyogenic strains (n=10), Enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16S rRNA-encoding, recA, secA, and secY gene sequences.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. Two of these species, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, Streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. Given that S. salivarius and S. vestibularis share several physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to S. thermophilus. However, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that S. vestibularis is more closely related to S. thermophilus. To determine whether this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from secA and secY, the general secretion housekeeping genes, recA, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences using other streptococcal species as outgroups. RESULTS: The maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic inferences derived from the secA and recA gene sequences provided strong support for the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16S rRNA-encoding and secY-based analyses could not discriminate between alternate topologies. Phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSION: Our results corroborated the sister-relationship between S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of S. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only Streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, Streptococcus gallinaceus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. During investigations of the aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. Phenotypic characterization using the API20 STREP kit identified the isolates as Aerococcus viridans (10), Aerococcus urinae (2), Leuconostoc species (4), Streptococcus salivarius (2), Streptococcus bovis II 3 (1), Enterococcus avium (3), Enterococcus faecium (1) or Gemella morbillorum (1). However, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as Streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were E. avium (3), E. faecium (1) or Lactobacillus species (1). Misidentification by API20 STREP was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as S. pluranimalium. The isolates of S. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA. The capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. Demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Pseudimonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans were also tested. The strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. The MDR strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of Acacia nilotica, Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of Terminalia arjuna and Eucalyptus globulus. Community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. The most potent antimicrobial plant was A. nilotica (MIC range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher MIC values than A. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. This study concludes that A. nilotica, C. zeylanicum and S. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.
TI  - Tigecycline (GAR-936) activity against Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci including Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. Tigecycline (GAR-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. The studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and fewer strains of S. gallolyticus (98 strains) and Streptococcus mutans (50 strains). These strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/mL for tigecycline per US Food and Drug Administration). Penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (S. sanguis) to 98% (S. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). Tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for S. gallolyticus. In conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and S. gallolyticus with an overall MIC90 at < or = 0.06 microg/mL; the highest MIC was only 0.25 microg/mL.
TI  - Blood culture-negative endocarditis in a reference center: etiologic diagnosis of 348 cases.
AB  - To identify the current etiologies of blood culture-negative infective endocarditis and to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics associated with each etiology, as well as with unexplained cases, we tested samples from 348 patients suspected of having blood culture-negative infective endocarditis in our diagnostic center, the French National Reference Center for Rickettsial Diseases, between 1983 and 2001. Serology tests for Coxiella burnettii, Bartonella species, Chlamydia species, Legionella species, and Aspergillus species; blood culture on shell vial; and, when available, analysis of valve specimens through culture, microscopic examination, and direct PCR amplification were performed. Physicians were asked to complete a questionnaire, which was computerized. Only cases of definite infective endocarditis, as defined by the modified Duke criteria, were included. A total of 348 cases were recorded-to our knowledge, the largest series reported to date. Of those, 167 cases (48%) were associated with C. burnetii, 99 (28%) with Bartonella species, and 5 (1%) with rare, fastidious bacterial agents of endocarditis (Tropheryma whipplei, Abiotrophia elegans, Mycoplasma hominis, Legionella pneumophila). Among 73 cases without etiology, 58 received antibiotic drugs before the blood cultures. Six cases were right-sided endocarditis and 4 occurred in patients who had a permanent pacemaker. Finally, no explanatory factor was found for 5 remaining cases (1%), despite all investigations.Q fever endocarditis affected males in 75% of cases, between 40 and 70 years of age. Ninety-one percent of patients had a previous valvulopathy, 32% were immunocompromised, and 70% had been exposed to animals. Our study confirms the improved clinical presentation and prognosis of the disease observed during the last decades. Such an evolution could be related to earlier diagnosis due to better physician awareness and more sensitive diagnostic techniques. As for Bartonella species, B. quintana was recorded more frequently than B. henselae (53 vs 17 cases). For 18 patients with Bartonella endocarditis, the responsible species was not identified. Species determination was achieved through culture and/or PCR in 49 cases and through Western immunoblotting in 22. Comparison of B. quintana and B. henselae endocarditis revealed distinct epidemiologic patterns. The 2 cases due to T. whipplei reflect the emerging role of this agent as a cause of infective endocarditis. Because identification of the bacterium was possible only through analysis of excised valves by histologic examination, PCR, and culture on shell vial, the prevalence of the disease might be underestimated. Among patients who received antibiotic drugs before blood cultures, 4 cases (7%) were found to be associated with Streptococcus species (2 S. bovis and 2 S. mutans) through 16S rDNA gene amplification directly from the valve, which shows the usefulness of this technique in overcoming the limitations of previous antibiotic treatment. Right-sided endocarditis occurred classically in young patients (mean age, 36 yr), intravenous drug users in 50% of cases, and suffering more often from embolic complications. Finally, 5 cases without etiology or explaining factors were all immunocompetent male patients with previous aortic valvular lesions, and 3 of the 5 presented with an aortic abscess. Further investigations should be focused on this group to identify new agents of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Molecular diagnosis of infective endocarditis by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of DNA from valve tissue.
AB  - We used broad-range eubacterial PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing to identify microbial pathogens in heart valve material from 29 patients with histologically confirmed infective endocarditis and 23 patients free of infective endocarditis. Microorganisms cultured by conventional techniques matched those identified by PCR in 21 cases. PCR alone identified the causative agent in three cases (Streptococcus bovis, Staphylococcus cohnii, and Coxiella burnetii), allowing better patient management. PCR corrected the initial bacteriological diagnosis in three cases (Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mutans, and Bartonella henselae). Among the 29 cases of histologically confirmed infective endocarditis, PCR findings were positive in 27 cases and were consistent with the bacterial morphology seen at Gram staining (26 cases) or with the results obtained by immunohistologic analysis with an anti-C. burnetii monoclonal antibody (one case). In two other cases of histologically confirmed infective endocarditis, PCR remained negative in a blood culture-negative case for which no bacteria were seen at histological analysis and in one case with visualization of cocci and blood cultures positive for Enterococcus faecalis. Ten clinical diagnoses of possible infective endocarditis were ruled out by histopathological analysis of the valves and subsequently by PCR. PCR was negative in 13 of the 14 patients in whom infective endocarditis was rejected on clinical grounds; the other patient was found to have Coxiella burnetii infective endocarditis on the basis of PCR and histopathological analysis and was subsequently included in the group of 29 definite cases. In total, PCR contributed to the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis in 6 of 29 (20%) cases.
TI  - groESL sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The full-length sequences of the groESL genes (also known as cpn10/60) of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groESL genes of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius were determined. The lengths of the groES genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groEL determined for 4 species (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. The intergenic region (spacer) between the groES and groEL genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. The variation of the groES sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groEL sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). Phylogenetic analysis of the groES and groEL genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of the 16S rRNA gene. The intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. The groESL sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) compared to eleven other antimicrobial agents against streptococcal isolates, excluding Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The purpose of the study presented here was to determine the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared with that of 11 other antimicrobial agents (5 of them quinolones) against 400 isolates of beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. The minimum inhibitory concentration values for gemifloxacin against 90% of the streptococci tested were as follows: Lancefield groups A, C and G, 0.06 microg/ml; Lancefield group B, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus bovis, 0.125 microg/ml; and Streptococcus milleri, 0.03 microg/ml. Resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and erythromycin was found mainly in the Streptococcus mitis isolates; tetracycline showed variable results, and no vancomycin resistance was encountered. Higher rates of ciprofloxacin resistance were identified in the Streptococcus bovis, mitis and mutans isolates. In conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active quinolone tested followed by trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, especially against isolates resistant to beta-lactam agents, macrolides and tetracycline.
TI  - Structure and transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding pyruvate formate-lyase of a ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The gene (pfl) encoding pyruvate formate-lyase (Pfl) from Streptococcus bovis was sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of Pfl was similar to Streptococcus mutans Pfl, and included the conserved regions necessary for free-radical formation and a catalytic site. The Pfl of S. bovis appeared to be a free-radical-containing enzyme because of its dioxygen sensitivity and its amino acid sequence similarity with the Escherichia coli enzyme. The pfl mRNA of S. bovis was approximately 2.3 kb and was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. When cells were grown in batch culture at pH 6.9, the level of pfl transcript increased as the growth phase changed from exponential growth to stationary phase. This result was in constrast to the previous observation that the level of lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) mRNA decreased during the later stages of growth. Continuous culture experiments conducted at pH 6.9 under glucose-limited and ammonia-limited conditions revealed that pfl mRNA was decreased by an excess supply of glucose, as well as by a high growth rate. On the contrary, ldh mRNA increased when excess glucose was supplied and the growth rate was high. The amount of pfl mRNA in cells was lower at pH 4.5 than pH 6.9, whereas the level of ldh mRNA was higher at pH 4.5. This result was consistent with the amounts of Pfl and Ldh in cells and the proportion of formate and lactate produced. These results support the hypothesis that S. bovis regulates Pfl and Ldh synthesis at the transcriptional level in response to growth conditions.
TI  - Intracellular alpha-amylase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Sequencing upstream of the Streptococcus mutans gene for a CcpA gene homolog, regM, revealed an open reading frame, named amy, with homology to genes encoding alpha-amylases. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a strong similarity (60% amino acid identity) to the intracellular alpha-amylase of Streptococcus bovis and, in common with this enzyme, lacked a signal sequence. Amylase activity was found only in S. mutans cell extracts, with no activity detected in culture supernatants. Inactivation of amy by insertion of an antibiotic resistance marker confirmed that S. mutans has a single alpha-amylase activity. The amylase activity was induced by maltose but not by starch, and no acid was produced from starch. S. mutans can, however, transport limit dextrins and maltooligosaccharides generated by salivary amylase, but inactivation of amy did not affect growth on these substrates or acid production. The amylase digested the glycogen-like intracellular polysaccharide (IPS) purified from S. mutans, but the amy mutant was able to digest and produce acid from IPS; thus, amylase does not appear to be essential for IPS breakdown. However, when grown on excess maltose, the amy mutant produced nearly threefold the amount of IPS produced by the parent strain. The role of Amy has not been established, but Amy appears to be important in the accumulation of IPS in S. mutans grown on maltose.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Cloning, sequence, and expression of the L-(+) lactate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The ldh gene encoding the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent L-(+) lactate dehydrogenase from the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis was cloned and sequenced. A genomic library of S. bovis JB1 DNA was constructed in lambda ZAP II and screened by use of a heterologous probe derived from the cloned Streptococcus mutans ldh gene. Several clones were isolated that contained a common 2.9-kb fragment as determined by restriction analysis. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 987-bp open reading frame with extensive homology to Streptococcus thermophilus and S. mutans ldh nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. Expression of the cloned S. bovis ldh gene in Escherichia coli was confirmed by the ability to complement the ldh mutation of E. coli FMJ39, by using an in-gel activity screen and by enzymatic assay. Increased LDH activity was observed in S. bovis JB1 containing the cloned ldh genes on a multicopy plasmid.
TI  - [Evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the Enterococcus genus].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in NaCl esculin broth and group D antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the Enterococcus genus were performed. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 E. faecium, 3 E. avium, 16 Streptococcus intermedius, 7 S. salivarius, 4 S. bovis, 4 S. constellatus, 2 S. sanguis and 1 strain of S. equinus, S. mitis, S. uberis and S. mutans were studied. The tests used were: rapid test in NaCl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup D streptococcus agglutination (Patho Dx Strep D/PYR; Diagnostic Product Corporation). All catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the Enterococcus genus. The usefulness of Gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. RESULTS: The results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. No significant differences were observed between the results obtained with Gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the Streptococcus mutans strain. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group D agglutination and rapid test in NaCl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Evaluation of the automicrobic system for the identification of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The performance of the Automicrobic System with the Vitek gram-positive identification card (bioMerieux, France) in identifying strains of Streptococcus mutans was studied. Of 160 strains assayed, 72.5% were confirmed to be Streptococcus mutans; the remainder were identified as other species of streptocci (Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis I and II, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus constellatus).
TI  - Determination of 16S rRNA sequences of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and phylogenetic relationships among members of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - We determined the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and calculated the phylogenetic distances between those organisms and other members of the genus Streptococcus. The viridans group streptococci were separated into five phylogenetic groups; we named these groups the anginosus group, the mitis group, the salivarius group, the bovis group, and the mutans group. S. mitis and S. gordonii clustered in the mitis group together with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus parasanguis at levels of sequence homology of more than 96%. Within this group, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae exhibited more than 99% sequence homology with each other, although the DNA-DNA similarity values for their total chromosome DNAs were less than 60%.
TI  - [Clinical significance of bacteremia caused by streptococci of the viridans group].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The viridans group Streptococcus (SVG) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of SVG. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation (Hemoline/BioMerieux) of SVG (Api 20 STREP/BioMerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. RESULTS: The most frequent species of SVG isolated were: S. sanguis II (29.4%), S. mitis (27.3%) and S. anginosus (12.9%). With regard to the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating S. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and S. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). More than half of the isolations of S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. mutans and S. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II, S. mitis, S. salivarius and S. acidominimus). The significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (S. sanguis II being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). In 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. The endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for S. sanguis II, S. sanguis I, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. adjacens; similar in both diseases for S. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for S. anginosus. CONCLUSIONS: In this series the isolation of SVG group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of SVG.
TI  - The presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  - The protein, HPr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in bacteria, was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. The purified preparation gave only one band when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pI = 4.85). However, electrophoresis in Tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by PEP in the presence of enzyme I of the PTS or by ATP with the HPr kinase. Homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained by preparative electrophoresis. Each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. The electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees C for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees C for several months. Both HPr proteins catalyzed in vitro the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with a preparation of HPr containing both forms of the protein. Both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from PEP to the other specific PTS proteins known in S salivarius. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. The presence of the 2 forms of HPr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of S salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. A doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (S mutans, S sobrinus, S sanguis, S thermophilus, S bovis, S rattus) and also in L lactis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Properties of a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) extracted from intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. A polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kDa comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. In vivo labelling of S. sanguis cells with 32Pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the HPr became dephosphorylated. Antiserum raised to the S. sanguis HPr reacted on Western blots with HPrs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, but not with HPrs from S. faecalis or S. bovis, nor with proteins from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces viscosus and various lactobacilli. The S. sanguis HPr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the HPrs from S. mutans an S. salivarius. The N-terminal residues (to 37) of the S. sanguis HPr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the N-terminal sequence of S. faecalis HPr. It is suggested that HPr in S. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. Non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of HPr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.
TI  - Classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  - This review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. The goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. This method has resulted in the division of some species. Streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common in humans. Three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. Conversely, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, and "S. milleri" have been combined under S. anginosus. S. mitis (or "S. mitior") can be well-defined and includes S. sanguis II. There is genetic heterogeneity within S. sanguis, but the species is usually easy to identify. There is also some heterogeneity in S. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. Discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. Among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.
TI  - A physiological classification of viridans streptococci by use of the API-20STREP system.
AB  - Physiological reactions of viridans streptococci were examined by the API-20STREP system and a selection of conventional tests. Cluster analysis of these results produced a classification similar to a taxonomic scheme based on that of Colman and Williams. The organisms could be divided into the six recognised species--Streptococcus mutans, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and S. milleri. Analysis confirmed that S. mitior and S. sanguis can be distinguished in the API-20STREP test by hydrolysis of arginine but not by dextran production. Although S. mutans, S. mitior and S. sanguis can be divided into two further subgroups, the taxonomic significance of this is unclear. With this means of classification, most organisms could be identified easily by a small number of tests. API-20STREP is convenient for performing physiological tests on viridans streptococci, but the information provided by the manufacturers in regard to identification and nomenclature is in need of revision.
TI  - DNA probe for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A total of 287 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. The test was positive for all but one isolate, strain DOC-1. This autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of S. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lytA gene. We used lytA as a DNA probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. In dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the DNA of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate DOC-1. No hybridization occurred when strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus bovis were tested. The lytA gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a DNA probe for the identification of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Identification of viridans streptococci by three commercial systems.
AB  - The API 20S (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY), the GPI card (Vitek Systems, St.  Louis, MO) and the RapSTR system (Innovative Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) were compared with conventional biochemicals for the identification of viridans streptococci. One hundred nine clinical isolates were tested that included the following species: intermedius (38) sanguis II (20), bovis (variant) (14), mitis (14), salivarius (11), sanguis I (6), constellatus (3), mutans (2), and uberis (1). With initial testing, a correct species call was made with 72% of the isolates with the GPI card, 62% with the RapSTR, and 50% with the API 20S. Identifications of viridans streptococci group or those that needed additional biochemicals for species identification occurred with 28% of isolates with the API 20S, 8% with the RapSTR, and 9% with the GPI card. Incorrect identifications occurred with 6% of the isolates tested by the GPI card, 20% with the API 20S, and 30% with the RapSTR. Most discrepancies with the RapSTR were with 66% of the intermedius isolates, whereas most, 55%, of misidentifications with the API 20S were with sanguis II isolates. No identifications were made with 2% and 13% of isolates with the API 20S and GPI, respectively.
TI  - Partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by Streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  - The production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin. Actinomycetes and Neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. Streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. S. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius. Inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. Extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - [Identification of Streptococcus viridans in clinical specimens].
AB  - In a 4 year prospective study of "viridans" or non-groupable streptococci 100 clinically significant strains were isolated. Strains were defined as significant when found in two or more samples of blood cultures, or when seen on Gram staining together with inflammatory reaction. Fifty-two strains were speciated by 10 physiological characteristics. In 42 cases additional tests were performed. Only 16 isolates were unidentifiable by the techniques used. Sources of isolates included purulent lesions (53%) (mainly S. milleri and S. mitior); endocarditis (27%) (S. bovis I, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. bovis II) and urinary tract infections (10%) (S. bovis II, S. milleri).
TI  - Presumptive identification of "Streptococcus milleri" in 5 h.
AB  - Rapid miniaturized tests for acetoin production, arginine hydrolysis, and sorbitol fermentation were used for presumptive identification of non-beta-hemolytic "Streptococcus milleri" isolates in 5 h. All 77 "S. milleri" strains tested were Voges-Proskauer positive, arginine hydrolysis positive, and sorbitol fermentation negative. On the basis of these reactions, "S. milleri" was differentiated from isolates of other viridans group streptococcal species and from Streptococcus bovis.
TI  - Evaluation of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in  patients with cirrhosis.
AB  - To determine the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, 14 patients (7 males, 7 females) with 16 Gram-negative infective episodes (12 Escherichia coli and 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae) were treated with aztreonam infusions at doses of 1 gm per 8 hr for a planned 14-day period. Ages ranged from 40 to 75 years with a mean of 57 +/- 10 years. All organisms were highly susceptible to aztreonam (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms per ml). Serum antibiotic levels were 61.9 +/- 25.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 27 +/- 18.5 micrograms per ml (trough). Ascitic fluid antibiotic levels were 33.6 +/- 22.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 32.7 +/- 16.8 micrograms per ml (trough). Although the symptoms of infection were controlled within 3 days and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr, 10 patients (62.5%) died, with hepatorenal syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage as the principal causes of death. Three patients developed streptococcal superinfections during treatment; Streptococcus faecalis peritonitis in one case and spontaneous bacteremia due to Streptococcus equinus and Streptococcus mutans in the other two. Aztreonam was well tolerated and clinically and bacteriologically efficacious in controlling the infection. Serum and ascitic fluid levels were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative organisms, suggesting that lower doses may achieve suitable therapeutic levels. A negative aspect of the antibiotic therapy was the superinfections. The high mortality rate was attributable to the generally poor underlying condition of the patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of A-16686, a new glycopeptide.
AB  - A-16686 is a novel glycopeptide antibiotic derived from Actinoplanes. A-16686 inhibited hemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C, F, and G at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml, with 90% inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, including erythromycin-resistant isolates. S. bovis, various viridans groups streptococci, S. mitis, S. mutans, and S. sanguis were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and MICs of S. faecalis and S. faecium were 0.5-2 micrograms/ml. Most staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, were inhibited by 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. A-16686 was bactericidal with minimal difference between MIC and MBC for gram-positive species. A-16686 did not inhibit Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas.
TI  - Growth inhibition of Streptococcus mutans by cellular extracts of human intestinal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro growth of Streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by water-soluble extracts from cells of various intestinal lactic acid bacteria identified as Streptococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The growth inhibition was dependent on the concentrations of the extracts. In contrast, the extracts did not inhibit the growth of the major indigenous intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from humans. These lactic acid bacteria were not acutely toxic in mice.
TI  - Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and Omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  - In recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. In the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (Omniserum). Representatives of the following species were included: Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, S. intermedius, S. lactis, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. suis, and Aerococcus viridans. Serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. Fifteen (12%) of the strains gave positive reactions by all three methods. Positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. Altogether 84 (68%) strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. Latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. Absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. These findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
TI  - The phylogenetic position of Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, S. equinus, S. bovis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. cricetus, S. lactis, S. raffinolactis and Enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16S ribosomal RNA. All the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the Brochothrix and Listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'Clostridium' branch of Gram-positive eubacteria. Within the Steptococcus-Enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by Enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group D streptococci.
AB  - The SeroSTAT latex agglutination test (Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskesville, R.I.) for identification of group D streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and Lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group D streptococci (S. faecalis, 74; S. bovis, 24; S. durans, 3; S. faecium, 9) and 65 viridans streptococci (S. anginosus-constellatus, 2; Streptococcus MG, 15; S. sanguis II, 14; S. mitis, 7; S. mutans, 5; S. salivarius, 8; S. sanguis I, 8; S. acidominimus, 1; S. morbillorum, 2; S. pneumoniae, 3). All strains of group D streptococci were bile-esculin positive. SeroSTAT reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of S. sanguisII and 1 strain of Streptococcus MG (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 S. bovis, 8 S. faecalis, 1 S. durans, and 6 S. faecium strains (22.7% of all group D streptococci tested). When considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, SeroSTAT is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group D streptococci.
TI  - Streptococci isolated from the bloodstream and gingival crevice of man.
AB  - One hundred and twenty six strains of streptococci isolated from the bloodstreams of 123 hospital in-patients--55 with endocarditis--and 255 strains isolated from the gingival crevices of 66 volunteers were characterised. Species isolated were Streptococcus mitior, S. sanguis, undifferentiated viridans streptococci, S. salivarius, S. milleri, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. faecalis. There was no significant difference between the distribution of species in blood and in the gingival crevice. S. mitior and S. sanguis were found less frequently in blood than their presence in the gingival crevice would have suggested, whereas S. milleri was found more frequently. This may indicate that S. milleri is more invasive or that it enters the bloodstream from sources other than the gingival crevice.
TI  - Purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from Streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  - It was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. The pyruvate kinases of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) from S. sanguis NCTC 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits. Whereas the pyruvate kinase from S. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (K. Abbe and T. Yamada, J. Bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme from S. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In the presence of 0.5 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP, were hyperbolic, and the Km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mM, respectively. Without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. GDP, IDP, and UDP could replace ADP. Like the enzyme from S. mutans, the enzyme from S. sanguis required a divalent cation, Mg2+ or Mn2+, and a monovalent cation, K+ or NH4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by Pi. When the concentration of Pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and Hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate increased. The remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of Pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in S. sanguis in vivo.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - Anaerobic radiometric detection of facultative Gram-positive cocci in blood.
AB  - Radiometric detection of facultative gram-positive cocci, particularly streptococci, has been reported to be suboptimal. A recently marketed anaerobic Bactec bottle (7C) with purportedly improved capability to detect facultative gram-positive cocci in blood was compared with the previously available bottle in a study of simulated bacteremia. The Bactec system detected all beta-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci tested. Detection of alpha-hemolytic streptococci was improved in general. However, detection of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus pneumoniae remained suboptimal under anaerobic conditions. A metabolic index unit threshold for positivity of 15 is recommended when employing the anaerobic Bactec bottle.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Further characteristics of beta2-microglobulin binding to oral streptococci.
AB  - A total of 85 strains of oral bacteria representing Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. Mitior, S. salivarious, S. milleri, S. infrequens, S. durans, S. lactis, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. equinus, Streptococcus species group E, Actinomyces, and one group A Streptococcus were tested for binding of aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin. Positive affinity between bacteria and aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin was detected in 36% of the strains. No apparent correlation with bacterial species, serotype, or group was noted. No positive strains were detected among seven group I:A S. sanguis strains (P < 0.01). Binding constants for one S. mutans strain indicated heterogeneous binding structures on the bacterial surface. The number of binding sites for aggregates of human beta 2-microglobulin involving multipoint attachment varied from 70 to 1,700 per bacterial cell. With whole saliva as buffer, a general increase in affinity was seen. Variations in salt concentrations of the buffers revealed different salt-dependent species-associated uptake patterns. Oral bacteria tended to have an uptake maximum at a salt concentration similar to that seen in saliva. Binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin on oral streptococci were sensitive to pepsin, heat, and formaldehyde treatment. Bacterial binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin might represent one of several factors of importance for bacterial attachment in the oral cavity. Experimental conditions reflecting the salivary milieu increased the degree of interaction, emphasizing the importance of physiological test systems for such studies.
TI  - Immunotherapy of the guinea pig line 10 hepatocarcinoma with a variety of nonviable bacteria.
AB  - A variety of heat-killed bacteria were tested for their capacity to induce regressions of established line 10 hepatocarcinomas in syngeneic guinea pigs. Multiple intralesional injections of heat-killed Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Listeria monocytogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes resulted in complete regression of the tumor in a majority of guinea pigs. Repeated injections of heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis strain Bacillus Calmette-Guerin caused no regressions. Surviving animals were immune to subsequent challenge with line 10 cells but not L2C cells, another syngeneic tumor.
TI  - The isolation of streptococci from human faeces.
AB  - Three selective media were designed for isolation of streptococci from faeces. Samples of faeces from twelve normal adults were suspended and serially diluted in saline or broth saline, and equal volumes of each dilution were spread and incubated on the media. The number of colonies of each different type which developed was counted and one colony of each type was subcultured and identified. Altogether, streptococci of 13 taxa were found. S. faecium, S. mutans, S. milleri, S. faecalis and S. mitior were each found in over half the samples. Lancefield group B and G streptococci, S. bovis II, an atypical strain of S. bovis I, S. cremoris, S. durans and a dextran-positive strain of S. mitior were each present in 1 or 2 samples. Individual samples contained 2-7 (mean 4.6) streptococcal taxa, and total viable counts of streptococci of 3 X 10(3)-3 X 10(8) (geometric mean 7 X 10(5)) per g. The significance of these findings is discussed.
TI  - Serologic studies of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum by crossed immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - A reference antigen-antibody system for Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus  constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum was established with crossed immunoelectrophoresis. A comparison of S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum with crossed immunoelectrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel indicated that S. intermedius and S. constellatus are closely related antigenically with as many as six common cytoplasmic antigens. S. morbillorum was antigenically more distinct; antiserum of one strain of S. morbillorum was monospecific, indicating that specific serogroups of S. morbillorum exist. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis and tandem crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed that S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum also share some common antigens with Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis, but S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum are antigenically distinct from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus bovis.
TI  - Adherence of glucan-positive and glucan-negative streptococcal strains to normal  and damaged heart valves.
AB  - The adherence of 18 strains of streptococci to sections of normal canine and human aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves and to canine interatrial septum was compared in an in vitro system. Quantitative measurements of adherence ratios were performed by two independent methods. Adherence ratios for Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. bovis, and Group D streptococci were higher (0.0058-0.0101) than for the other streptococcal strains studied (0.0025-0.0041). With the exception of Group D streptococci, adherence ratios for each bacterial strain were similar with the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve sections. Adherence ratios with normal human and canine valve leaflets were similar, but adherence ratios with interatrial septum were lower than with normal valve sections. Adherence ratios for glucan-positive and glucan-negative strains of streptococci with normal and with damaged aortic valve leaflets were also compared. The adherence ratios of the glucan-positive streptococci (S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. bovis) and one glucan-negative enterococcal strain (KG-3) were approximately five times higher with damaged aortic valves (0.039-0.051) than with normal aortic valves (0.009-0.010). For glucan-positive strains, adherence ratios with normal aortic leaflets were similar when bacteria were grown in media which contains or lacks sucrose. In striking contrast, growth of the glucan-positive strains in medium which lacks sucrose, with resultant deficiency of glucan production, decreased the adherence ratios with damaged aortic valve leaflets to those found with normal aortic leaflets. Treatment of glucan-positive strains with dextranase resulted in a decrease in their adherence ratios to levels seen with bacteria grown in medium lacking sucrose, but the higher adherence ratios could be restored in the presence of exogenous dextran.It is concluded that glucan production is one quantitatively important factor that contributes to the greater adherence of glucan-positive streptococci to damaged rather than to normal aortic heart valve leaflets. However, glucan production is not the only factor that determines preferential adherence of streptococci to damaged heart valves, because glucan-negative strains may also show some degree of increased adherence to damaged valves. Thus, bacterial glucan production is one of the factors that could contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Binding of lectins to Streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  - The lectin concanavalin A (Con A) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. Strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. Strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin RCA. S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, and Lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. The S. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by Con A. The a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. Glucan from d and e strains of S. mutans and dextran T2000 were also precipitated by Con A. D-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by Con A and the agglutination of type d cells by D-galactose. The quantity of [acetyl-3H]Con A bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. Cells grown in sucrose medium bound more Con A than those grown in glucose medium. After treatment with dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more Con A. The binding of Con A to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of Con A to the antibody globulin on the cell surface. Con A bound to S. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in vitro adherence. Bound Con A also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.
TI  - The effect of adsorption on the acid production of caries and noncaries-producing streptococci.
AB  - Eighteen different Streptococcus strains including S mutans, sanguis, mitis, salivarius, bovis, and 2F2, were assayed for their relative adsorption to synthetic hydroxyapatite and for quantities of lactic acid produced while in the adsorbed state. The results indicated that all S mutans and some S sanguis have an enhanced metabolic activity while adsorbed to hydroxapatite as compared to control suspensions without hydroxyapatite.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Members of the viridans group of streptococci are the commonest causes of bacterial endocarditis. However, Streptococcus mutans, a member of this group associated with dental caries which might be expected to be commonly associated with endocarditis, has only rarely been reported. This is possibly because of difficulties in isolation and identification. Differing blood culture media may affect the chances of isolation of these organisms, and, though brain-heart infusion, thiol, tryptic soy, and glucose-brain infusion broths have all proved satisfactory, subcultures may require increased CO2 concentrations for growth. Plemorphism in the resultant colonies and in the individual organisms may give rise to a hazardous misinterpretation of this appearance as contamination. Strep. mutans and the similarly penicillin sensitive Strep. bovis may be differentiated from the penicillin resistant enterococci by their lincomycin sensitivity and intolerance of 6-3 per cent sodium chloride. Precise differentiation of streptococci in bacterial endocarditis is of value both epidemiologically and in the management of the disease.
TI  - Streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  - A collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. Of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. The endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: Streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and usually mannitol-fermenting strains of S. bovis (S. bovis I), 15-1%; S. mutans, 14-2%; S. mitior, 13-2%. Streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (S. sanguis, S. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. When the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (S. mutans, S. bovis I, S. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling S. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. Endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. In young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. Infections with S. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with S. bovis I at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. A history of previous heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. The streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was S. milleri (29-3%). It was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. The only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. In other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and S. milleri.
TI  - Arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls from Str. bovis, Str. lactis, Str. mutans, Str. thermophilus, Str. salivarius, and Str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but Str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. S. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. It was also shown that cell walls from S. epidermidis, B. megaterium, and M. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. A close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the PPD hypersensitivity. It was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
TI  - Streptoccus mutans dextransucrase: purification, properties, and requirement for  primer dextran.
AB  - We attempted to purify dextransucrase from S mutans strain 6715 to investigate its properties and determine if multiple species of the enzyme existed. It was concluded that the properties of this enzyme such as the pH (5.5), temperature (37 C) optimum, and Km for sucrose (3 mM) are very similar to those reported for S sanguis, S bovis, S mutans strain OMZ-176 isozymes, S mutans strain GS-5, and the single dextransucrase purified from S mutans strain HS-6. The IEF enzyme preparation consisted of two enzyme species, possibly differing in their ability to synthesize different dextran linkages. The minor enzyme activity demonstrated a strict primer dependency. Similarly, primer dependency has been reported for dextransucrases from S mutans, S sanguis, and L mesenteroides. S mutans strain 6715 dextransucrase also showed both the insertion and stepwise mechanisms for dextran synthesis. Sucrose was the sole glucose donor, whereas dextran was a specific, highly efficient glucose acceptor. The complex primer kinetics are not fully understood at this time and require further investigation. Without linkage analysis of the products of our enzymes, we can only postulate that each enzyme has a different function in the synthesis of interresidue and interchain alpha1-3 and alpha1-6 bonds. Insoluble dextran synthesis may involve a special enzyme mechanism characteristic of S mutans. This synthesis would require both enzymes, possibly in some aggregated form, with one enzyme synthesizing endogenous primer dextran. This endogeneous primer or some cell wall polysaccharide could stimulate both enzymes to rapidly synthesize heterogeneously linked insoluble dextran.
TI  - Regulation of lactate dehydrogenase and change of fermentation products in streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans JC 2 produced mainly lactate as a fermentation product when  grown in nitrogen-limited continuous culture in the presence of an excess of glucose and produced formate, acetate, and ethanol, but no lactate, under glucose-limited conditions. The levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in these cultures were of the same order of magnitude, and the activity of LDH was completely dependent on fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP). The intracellular level of FDP was high and the level of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) was low under the glucose-excess conditions. In the glucose-limited cultures, all glycolytic intermediates studied, except PEP, were low. S. mutans FIL, which had an FDP-independent LDH and similar levels of glycolytic intermediates as S. mutans JC2, produced mainly lactate under glucose-excess or under glucose-limited conditions. LDH of Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809 was dependent on FDP for activity at a low concentration of pyruvate but had a significant activity without FDP at a high concentration of pyruvate. This strain also produced mainly lactate both under glucose-excess and glucose-limited conditions. The levels and characteristics of these LDHs were not changed by the culture conditions. These results indicate that changes in the intracellular level of FDP regulate LDH activity, which in turn influences the type of fermentation products produced by streptococci. PEP, adenosine 5'-monophosphate, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and inorganic phosphate significantly inhibited LDH activity from S. mutans JC 2 and may also participate in the regulation of LDH activity in other streptococci.
TI  - Glucose-6-phosphate-dependent pyruvate kinase in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Pyruvate kinase of Streptococcus mutans JC 2 had an absolute and specific requirement for glucose-6-phosphate. Inorganic phosphate was a strong inhibitor. The enzyme required K+ or NH4+ and Mg2+ or Mn2+. S. mutans FIL and E 49, Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419 had also glucose-6-phosphate-dependent pyruvate kinases, whereas Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 had an enzyme activated by fructose-1,6-diphosphate.
TI  - Peptidoglycan composition and taxonomy of group D, E, and H streptococci, and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The qualitative and quantitative composition of the peptidoglycan from the cell wall of groups D, E, and H streptococci, and Streptococcus mutans, was determined. In group D, S. faecalis and the closely related species S. liquefaciens and S. zymogenes were separated from S. faecium and the closely related species S. durans on the basis of their peptidoglycan composition. A relationship among S. bovis, S. equinus, and some strains of S. mutans was indicated by the presence in each of a similar peptidoglycan containing threonine. Threonine was released from the S. mutans polymer as a threonine-lysine dipeptide. Hydrolysis of the dipeptide at 100 C for 24 hr in 6 n HC1 was required to break the peptide bond. Motile group D streptococci possessed a peptidoglycan of the same composition as S. faecium. Group E and H strains were also similar in the composition of their peptidoglycan. The results demonstrate that peptidoglycan composition can be used to (i) aid in the division of members of an immunological group into subgroups, and (ii) indicate a relationship between members of the same genus which are not related on an immunological basis.
