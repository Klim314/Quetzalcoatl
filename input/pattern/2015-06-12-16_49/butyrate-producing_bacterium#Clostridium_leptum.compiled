TI  - Fluctuations in butyrate-producing bacteria in ulcerative colitis patients of North India.
AB  - AIM: To study the interplay between butyrate concentration and butyrate-producing bacteria in fecal samples of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients vs control individuals. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 14 control individuals (hemorrhoid patients only) and 26 UC patients (severe: n = 12, moderate: n = 6, remission: n = 8), recruited by the gastroenterologist at the Department of Gastroenterology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Disease activity in UC patients was determined by clinical colitis activity index. We employed fluorescent in situ hybridization in combination with flow cytometry to enumerate the clostridium cluster population targeted by 16S rRNA gene probe. Major butyrate-producing species within this cluster were quantified to see if any change existed in control vs UC patients with different disease activity. This observed change was further validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition to this, we carried out gas chromatography to evaluate the changes in concentration of major short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), namely acetate, n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, in the above samples. Student t test and Graph pad prism-6 were used to compare the data statistically. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease of Clostridium coccoides (control, 25.69% +/- 1.62% vs severe, 9.8% +/- 2.4%, P = 0.0001) and Clostridium leptum clusters (control, 13.74% +/- 1.05% vs severe, 6.2% +/- 1.8%, P = 0.0001) in fecal samples of UC patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that some butyrate-producing members of the clostridial cluster, like Fecalibacterium prausnitzii (control, 11.66% +/- 1.55% vs severe, 6.01% +/- 1.6%, P = 0.0001) and Roseburia intestinalis (control, 14.48% +/- 1.52% vs severe, 9% +/- 1.83%, P = 0.02) were differentially present in patients with different disease activity. In addition, we also demonstrated decreased concentrations of fecal SCFAs, especially of n-butyrate (control, 24.32 +/- 1.86 mmol/muL vs severe, 12.74 +/- 2.75 mmol/muL, P = 0.003), iso-butyrate (control, 1.70 +/- 0.41 mmol/muL vs severe, 0.68 +/- 0.24 mmol/muL, P = 0.0441) and acetate (control, 39.51 +/- 1.76 mmol/muL vs severe, 32.12 +/- 2.95 mmol/muL, P = 0.047), in the fecal samples of UC patients. The observed decrease of predominant butyrate producers of clostridial clusters correlated with the reduced SCFA levels in active UC patients. This was further confirmed by the restoration in the population of some butyrate producers with simultaneous increase in the level of SCFA in remission samples. CONCLUSION: Our observations indicate that decreases in members of the clostridial cluster resulting in reduced butyrate levels contribute to the etiology of UC.
TI  - Decreased colonization of fecal Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale species from ulcerative colitis patients in an in vitro dynamic gut model with mucin environment.
AB  - The mucus layer in the colon, acting as a barrier to prevent invasion of pathogens, is thinner and discontinuous in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). A recent developed in vitro dynamic gut model, the M-SHIME, was used to compare long-term colonization of the mucin layer by the microbiota from six healthy volunteers (HV) and six UC patients and thus distinguish the mucin adhered from the luminal microbiota. Although under the same nutritional conditions, short-chain fatty acid production by the luminal communities from UC patients showed a tendency toward a lower butyrate production. A more in-depth community analysis of those microbial groups known to produce butyrate revealed that the diversity of the Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale and Clostridium leptum group, and counts of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were lower in the luminal fractions of the UC samples. Counts of Roseburia spp. were lower in the mucosal fractions of the UC samples. qPCR analysis for butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA transferase, responsible for butyrate production, displayed a lower abundance in both the luminal and mucosal fractions of the UC samples. The M-SHIME model revealed depletion in butyrate producing microbial communities not restricted to the luminal but also in the mucosal samples from UC patients compared to HV.
TI  - Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic, butyrate-producing bacterium isolated from the caecal content of a broiler chicken.
AB  - Five isolates that produced large amounts of butyrate were obtained in the course of a study on the butyrate-producing microbiota from the caecal content of a 4-week-old broiler chicken. The five isolates were virtually indistinguishable in biochemical and genetic terms, suggesting that they were derived from a single bacterial clone colonizing this habitat. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that the five isolates represented a unique lineage within the Clostridium leptum subgroup of the clostridia, with Eubacterium desmolans as the closest phylogenetic neighbour (about 93 % similarity). These data indicate that the five novel isolates represent a single novel species within a novel genus, for which we propose the name Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum is 25-3(T) (=LMG 24109(T) =CCUG 55265(T)). The DNA G+C content of strain 25-3(T) was 54.5 mol% .
TI  - Dietary fructooligosaccharides alter the cultivable faecal population of rats but do not stimulate the growth of intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  - The effect of fructans on the cultivable faecal community of Bio Breeding rats fed diets containing 5% (m/v) food-grade fructooligosaccharide (FOS) was investigated. Culturing of faecal material using chicory inulin as the sole carbohydrate source revealed the presence of a greater diversity of inulin-utilizing bacterial species in FOS-fed rats as compared with the control rats, although both contained species which effectively utilized inulin. The majority of cultivable inulin-utilizing species fell within the Clostridium coccoides group and Clostridium leptum subgroup, some of which were related to previously cultured butyrate-producing bacteria from the intestines of various animals. The impact of FOS on the growth of the indigenous bifidobacteria community and three inulin-utilizing isolates was assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. While dietary FOS was found to stimulate the growth of all three inulin-utilizing isolates, no growth stimulation of the indigenous bifidobacteria community occurred over the duration of the feeding trial.
TI  - Molecular profiling of the Clostridium leptum subgroup in human fecal microflora  by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone library analysis.
AB  - A group-specific PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method  was developed and combined with group-specific clone library analysis to investigate the diversity of the Clostridium leptum subgroup in human feces. PCR products (length, 239 bp) were amplified using C. leptum cluster-specific primers and were well separated by DGGE. The DGGE patterns of fecal amplicons from 11 human individuals revealed host-specific profiles; the patterns for fecal samples collected from a child for 3 years demonstrated the structural succession of the population in the first 2 years and its stability in the third year. A clone library was constructed with 100 clones consisting of 1,143-bp inserts of 16S rRNA gene fragments that were amplified from one adult fecal DNA with one forward universal bacterial primer and one reverse group-specific primer. Eighty-six of the clones produced the 239-bp C. leptum cluster-specific amplicons, and the remaining 14 clones did not produce these amplicons but still phylogenetically belong to the subgroup. Sixty-four percent of the clones were related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (similarity, 97 to 99%), 6% were related to Subdoligranulum variabile (similarity, approximately 99%), 2% were related to butyrate-producing bacterium A2-207 (similarity, 99%), and 28% were not identified at the species level. The identities of most bands in the DGGE profiles for the same adult were determined by comigration analysis with the 86 clones that harbored the 239-bp group-specific fragments. Our results suggest that DGGE combined with clone library analysis is an effective technique for monitoring and analyzing the composition of this important population in the human gut flora.
TI  - Genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene analysis.
AB  - A novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16S rRNA gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. Simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (PI) and SYTO BC provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). The three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. This analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. Cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the DGGE patterns showed that most of clones retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium leptum, and Bacteroides. We found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as Eubacterium rectale and Eubacterium hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. However, amplicons affiliated with Bacteroides and Ruminococcus obeum- and Eubacterium biforme-like bacteria, as well as Butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. Furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the Clostridium leptum cluster. The bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; B. longum and B. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while B. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.
TI  - Design and validation of 16S rRNA probes to enumerate members of the Clostridium  leptum subgroup in human faecal microbiota.
AB  - Among human faecal bacteria, many members of the Clostridium leptum subgroup are  fibrolytic and butyrate producing microorganisms thereby contributing to processes important to colonic health. Yet this phylogenetic subgroup remains poorly described to date. To improve detection and description of members of the C. leptum subgroup, the Clep 866 group probe was developed. Its association with probes targeting the Clostridium viride cluster (Cvir 1414) and Eubacterium desmolans species (Edes 635) allowed for the first time the detection of all members found in this phylogenetic group in human faecal microbiota. A species-specific probe was also designed to detect members of the Ruminococcus callidus species (Rcal 733). The design of signature regions was based on alignment of 16S rRNA sequences isolated from faeces of five healthy adults. Furthermore, an oligonucleotide competitor strategy was developed in order to improve the specificity of the probes formerly validated or designed in this study. The oligonucleotide probes were tested using a collection of target and non-target strains using FISH combined with flow cytometry. These new probes were added to a panel of 18 phylogenetic probes selected to describe faecal microbiota composition in 21 human faeces of healthy adults. Clostridium leptum subgroup represented 22% of the total faecal bacteria and codominated with members of Clostridium coccoides group. The cluster Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was the dominant component of the C. leptum subgroup and 20% of the latter subgroup remained unidentified at the species level.
TI  - Assessment of microbial diversity in human colonic samples by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
AB  - Abstract The bacterial species diversity of three colonic tissue samples from elderly people was investigated by sequence analysis of randomly cloned eubacterial 16S rDNA. The majority of sequences (87%) clustered within three bacterial groups: (1) Bacteroides; (2) low G+C content Gram-positives related to Clostridium coccoides (cluster XIVa); (3) Gram-positives related to Clostridium leptum (cluster IV). These groups have been shown to dominate the human faecal flora. Only 25% of sequences were closely related (>97%) to current species type strains, and 28% were less than 97% related to any database entry. 19% of sequences were most closely related to recently isolated butyrate-producing bacteria belonging to clusters XIVa and IV, with a further 18% of the sequences most closely related to Ruminococcus obeum and Ruminococcus torques (members of cluster XIVa). These results provide the first molecular information on the microbial diversity present in human colonic samples.
