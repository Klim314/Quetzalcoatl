TI  - First Report of bla(IMP-8) in Raoultella planticola.
AB  - Two carbapenem-resistant Raoultella planticola clinical isolates were isolated from patients with pneumonia and Port-A catheter-related bacteremia, respectively, in Taiwan. These isolates remained susceptible to fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, and colistin. Though the two isolates had the same antibiogram, plasmidic carbapenemase blaIMP-8, class 1 integron cassette (dfrA12-orfF-aadA2), and qnrB2, they had different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, plasmid sizes, and outer membrane protein loss profiles. To our knowledge, this is the first report of blaIMP-8 found in R. planticola. Interestingly, blaIMP-8 is the most common carbapenemase found in Klebsiella pneumoniae in Taiwan. In the literature, carbapenemase genes in R. planticola in each country were also found in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the same country.
TI  - Sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. It is approved in Japan for use in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, other Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. Noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, C. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. Gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. Adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - Notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  - Anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. This could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. This study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and 65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. The floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.7%), Escherichia coli (1.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). Anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (Peptococcus 12.4% and Peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), Bacteroides (12.4%), Clostridium (3.8%), Fusobacterium (2.9%) and Propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. In 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only Aspergillus, in association with Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, was identified. The study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Clinical features and prognostic factors of anaerobic infections: a 7-year retrospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Risk factors for mortality resulting from anaerobic infection are incompletely defined. The clinical significance of a broad range of pathogenic obligate anaerobic organisms was examined, and factors independently associated with mortality were identified in patients with clinically significant anaerobic infections. METHODS: The medical records of 1,050 patients with anaerobic infections were retrospectively reviewed at Severance Hospital in Seoul, Korea. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 54.1+/-16.8 years, and 57.7% were men. Overall, 320 (30.5%) patients with case-defined illness experienced pain at the affected site, and 230 (21.9%) experienced pus flow from lesions. Ten (1.4%) patients presented with shock, and 80.3% of the clinically significant cases were polymicrobial anaerobic infections. The mean number of pathogens, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, was 3.7+/-1.0 (minimum 1, maximum 5), and the number of anaerobic organisms was 1.0+/-0.3 in each specimen. The major pathogens by rank were the Bacteroides fragilis group, which accounted for 41.8% of anaerobic infections, followed by Clostridium spp. (11.8%), Prevotella spp. (9.4%), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (8.4%). Escherichia coli (17.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%) were common concomitant aerobic organisms. The overall crude mortality rate resulting from anaerobic infection was 29.7%. Among the determining factors associated with mortality, liver disease (p=0.003) and old age (p=0.005) were significant in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobic infection is polymicrobial and has a significant role in morbidity and mortality. Underlying liver disease was associated with poor prognosis in anaerobic infection.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. Eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral centre. INTERVENTION: Adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. Sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001). Infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, Streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (Porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, Prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, Clostridium perfringens 3.2%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. The anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. Over 92% of the streptococci were sensitive to the beta-Lactams contrast low susceptibility with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.
TI  - Deep neck abscess: an analysis of microbial etiology and the effectiveness of antibiotics.
AB  - The objective was to demonstrate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of deep neck space abscess and to analyze the coverage rate of different empiric antimicrobial agents. A retrospective review of hospitalized patients with deep neck abscess diagnosed at a tertiary-care, general hospital between April 2001 and October 2006. The study enrolled 100 patients. The bacterial cultures of 89 patients yielded positive results (89%). The predominant aerobes were viridans streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobes included species of Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, and Bacteroides. Five different combinations of empiric antibiotics, namely regimen 1: penicillin G and clindamycin and gentamicin, regimen 2: ceftriaxone and clindamycin, regimen 3: ceftriaxone and metronidazole, regimen 4: cefuroxime and clindamycin, and regimen 5: penicillin and metronidazole, were compared using the antimicrobial susceptibility of 89 cases. The coverage rates of regimens 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 67.4%, 76.4%, 70.8%, 61.8%, and 16.9%, respectively. The coverage of regimen 5 was considerably worse than that of the other four regimens (p < 0.001). Regimen 2 was significantly better than regimen 4 (p < 0.001). Regimen 2 had better coverage than regimens 1 (p = 0.096) and 3 (p = 0.302), but the difference was not statistically significant. This study demonstrates the bacteriology of deep neck abscess and analyzes the coverage rate of different empiric antimicrobial agents. Regimens 1, 2, and 3 could be good candidates for empiric antibiotics. Pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted after the culture results are obtained.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - DC-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. DC-159a showed activity against Streptococcus spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Staphylococcus spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. Against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the MIC 90 of DC-159a was 8 microg/ml. DC-159a was the most active against Enterococcus spp. (MIC 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml) and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of DC-159a against Mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. The MICs of DC-159a against Chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and DC-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. DC-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DC-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. The bactericidal activity of DC-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. These activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with DC-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.
TI  - Role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Pouch of Douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and 20 healthy women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. A total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. Of 37 positive cultures 21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. Most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) implantation. The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli, Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus spp. Our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus for optimum therapy of acute PID it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute PID and have affected the choice of therapy.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2003 and march 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2005 to March 2006 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 384 strains including 18 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 161 (70.3%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and ninty-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 171 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both primary and postoperative infections. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. But cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum fl-lactamase was seen in 5.0 per cents. We should be carefully followed up the facts that the increasing isolation rates of B. fragilis group and Bilophila wadsworthia which were resistant to both penicillins and cephems.
TI  - Complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis: microbiology and predictors of adverse outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the microbiological characteristics of a cohort of patients with complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis, and to identify the potential risk factors for adverse outcomes, with particular reference to the choice of empirical antibiotics, intrapleural fibrinolytics, adherence to management guidelines, and input from pulmonologists. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS: All patients with a diagnosis of complicated parapneumonic effusion/empyema thoracis admitted between January 2003 and June 2005. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Microbiological characteristics, mortality, and surgery-free survival. RESULTS. There were 63 patients, with a mean age of 64 (standard deviation, 16) years and a male-to-female ratio of 45:18. The pleural fluid culture positivity rate was 68%; Streptococcus milleri (19%), Bacteroides (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), and Peptostreptococcus (7%) were the most common organisms. Thirteen (21%) patients died during their index admission. Use of intrapleural fibrinolytics according to the guideline was associated with survival (P=0.001) while discordant initial antibiotic use was associated with mortality (P=0.002). Discordant initial antibiotic use was also independently associated with reduced surgery-free survival (P<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that early intrapleural fibrinolytic use (within 4 days of diagnosis) was associated with decreased mortality (P<0.001), increased surgery-free survival (P=0.005), and shorter hospital stay (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: Organisms identified from complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis differ from those giving rise to community-acquired pneumonia. In these patients, adherence to guidelines, early concordant antibiotic treatment, intrapleural fibrinolytics, and input from a pulmonologist were associated with improved outcomes.
TI  - [Characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  - War wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. Wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. War wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. This environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. War wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. The infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. Time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. Apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection. These are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. The determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. The etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp and Enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family Enterobacteriacea (Escherichia coil, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus - A. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods Clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods Bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; Peptostreptococcus spp and Peptococcus spp. The latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. Early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. The choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. It is used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. The characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. The use of antibiotics is not a substitution for surgical treatment. The expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. If the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. The keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2004 to March 2005 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 645 strains including 17 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 226 (79.0%) of 286 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and seventeen strains were isolated from primary infections, and 345 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both primary infections followed by Bilophila wadsworthia. While the isolation rate of B. fragilis group was also the highest from postoperative infections, the following bacteria were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa but not multidrug-resistant was seen in 13.3 per cents. Also cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase was seen in 7.0 per cents. We should be carefully followed up the facts that an increasing isolation rates of B. fragilis group and B. wadsworthia which were resistant to both penicillins and cephems.
TI  - Factors affecting the bacteriology of deep neck infection: a retrospective study  of 128 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Broad-spectrum antibiotics are advocated for treating deep neck infection. Anaerobic coverage is necessary, especially in odontogenic cases. The presence of diabetes, infection of the parotid space and an obvious odontogenic source of infection can aid in determining the causative organisms. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze the bacteriology in deep neck infections and identify the factors that influenced the causative pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 212 patients who were diagnosed as having deep neck infections at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1997 and 2003 were reviewed; 128 patients with bacterial isolation from their pus cultures were enrolled. RESULTS: The cultures of 46 patients (35.9%) were polymicrobial. Viridans Streptococcus was the most commonly isolated organism (38.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.0%) and Peptostreptococcus (17.2%). The most common organism in 44 diabetic patients was K. pneumoniae (54.5%), versus viridans streptococcus (48.8%) in 84 nondiabetic patients. In patients with dental sources of infections, the culture rate of anaerobes was 59.3%; in upper airway infections and other sources of infections they were 22.7% and 21.5%, respectively (Chi(2) test, p = 0.0008). The differences in age, sex, and climate did not show any significant changes in the common causative pathogens. Common pathogens in the infection of parapharyngeal, submandibular, and extended spaces were the same as viridans streptococcus, but in the parotid space K. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (CMZ, Cefmetazon), MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including CMZ against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of CMZ in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Cefmetazon was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), Escherichia coli (3.6% --> 0.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), Proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), Morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), Providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), Bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). The Change in percent resistance of MRSA, other CNS, and B. flagiris tended to increase. It is necessary to pay much attention to trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. flagiris and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX.
TI  - Microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). METHODS: Repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242 days. RESULTS: Bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. A total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Moraxella catarrhalis (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). The anaerobic bacteria included pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp (19), Peptostreptococcus spp (9), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). A change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. An increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of AECS in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with AECS for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2003 to March 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. Two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and aerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenm-resistant P. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. Last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant E. coli in this year. In the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and Enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2002 and March 2003].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2002 to March 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 334 strains were isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citobacter freundii. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci nor P. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. But we noticed cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral Cephems against various clinically isolated strains].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activities of oral Cephems against isolated from  the patients with the respiratory infections, the urinary tract infections, and infections in the obstetrics field of an adult and a child, during the period from 2002 to 2003; Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli of 40 strains of each, and Peptostreptococcus spp. 22 strains. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains that resistant is regarded were collected mainly, penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) strains. The MICs of Cephems except cefaclor (CCL) were < or = 0.03 microgram/mL against all strains of S. pyogenes. The MICs of cefteram (CFTM) and cefditoren (CDTR) were < or = 0.0125 microgram/mL activity against 7 strains penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP). However the MIC90s of cefditoren (CDTR) was 1 microgram/mL, cefteram (CFTM), and cefcapene (CFPN) were 2 micrograms/mL against PISP and PRSP, were higher than those of other drugs, but showed slightly higher than PSSP. The MIC90s of Cephems. were 0.5-4 micrograms/mL against strains of E. coli. The MIC90s of CFTM was 0.5 microgram/mL, and CDTR, CFPN were 1 microgram/mL against E. coli were higher than those of other drugs. The four strains of E. coli however were highly-resistant which MIC90s of CCL were more than 32 micrograms/mL were obtains. Furthermore it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant such as E. coli of Cephems. Although all strains showed resistant to AMPC, MIC90 of Cephems were 0.25-1 microgram/mL, good activities against K. pneumoniae. Against beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-susceptible H. influenzae (BLNAS) 23 strains the MIC90s of CCL and other Cephems were 64 micrograms/mL and 0.25-8 micrograms/mL. The MIC90s of CDTR and CFTM were < or = 1 microgram/mL of BLNAR (15 strains). However there of CFDN and CPDX were 8 micrograms/mL and CCL were > or = 16 micrograms/mL. Two strains which were produced beta-lactamase were highly--ABPC resistant. Although B. catarrhalis all strains were produced beta-lactamase and Cephems except for CCL showed better susceptibility than AMPC. The MIC90s of Cephems were 0.25-2 micrograms/mL against Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (CMZ) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan was evaluated yearly for two years from June 2000 to March 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and flomoxef (FMOX). In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002. In these surveillances spanning two years, the MIC90s of CMZ against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 micrograms/mL) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 73%-->87%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (other CNS, 13%-->18%), Escherichia coli (4%-->1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), Proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), Proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), Morganella morganii (7%-->0%), Providencia spp. (17%-->0%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other Bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). The change in percent resistance of MRSA, S. epidermidis, other CNS, and other Bacteroides spp. tended to increase. In addition, the percent resistance of B. fragilis was 10%. It is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that of SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. fragilis and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before CMZ was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity.
TI  - [Effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (PO) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium difficile) and fungi (Candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. The study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of PO decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) and the anticomplement activity in Klebsiella, Shigella, Propionibacterium, Clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus Candida, but increased ALA in nonhemolytic Escherichia. Under the action of PO an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. The data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of PO on the microbiocenosis of the intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2001 and March 2002].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2001 to March 2002 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, four hundred and twenty strains were isolated from 175 (79.2%) of 221 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and eighty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 234 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp., E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of suppurative thyroiditis (ST). Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the predominant aerobic isolates. The most common anaerobic bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Agents that are rarely recovered include Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides immitis, Candida spp., Treponema pallidum, and Echinococcus spp. Viruses have been associated with subacute thyroiditis, and include measles, mumps, influenza, enterovirus Epstein-barr, adenovirus, echovirus, and St Louis encephalitis. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage may be necessary in case of suppuration.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2000 and March 2001].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibilities during the period from April 2000 to March 2001 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 234 for one year. A total of 388 strains (136 strains from primary infections and 252 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 165 cases (70.5% of total cases). In primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. There was no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus nor Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1999 and March 2000].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. In this paper, the results obtained in the academic year 1999 (from April 1999 to March 2000) have been summarized. Two hundred seven cases were investigated, and 411 strains were isolated from 169 cases (81.6%). Of those strains, 184 and 227 strains were from primary infections and postoperative infections, respectively. In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes, Streptococcus spp., and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes were higher than in primary infections. Staphylococcus aureus were most frequently isolated among Gram-positive aerobes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii among Gram-positive anaerobes, E. coli among Gram-negative aerobes, and Bacteroides fragilis among Gram-negative anaerobes. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes, which gradually increased by the year 1998, decreased in the year 1999. The percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes increased, while that of Gram-negative bacteria was equivalent to that in the last year. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes, which continuously increased after the year 1990, decreased, while that of Gram-positive aerobes, which decreased in the last year, increased. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for 70.7% of S. aureus (41 strains). Either the number of strain or the percentage of MRSA decreased. The susceptibilities of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased against third and forth generation cephems, oxacephems, and monobactams. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems tend to decrease after the year 1997. S. aureus showed good susceptibilities to the tested drugs including arbekacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 16 acutely infected and 7 chronically infected sphenoid sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 29 isolates were recovered from the 16 cases of acute sphenoid sinusitis (1.8 per specimen): 22 aerobic and facultative (1.4 per specimen), and 7 anaerobic (0.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 10 specimens (62%), anaerobes alone were isolated in 3 (19%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 3 (19%). The predominant aerobic and facultative species were Staphylococcus aureus (9 isolates), Streptococcus spp (9), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A total of 28 isolates were recovered from the 7 cases of chronic sphenoid sinusitis (4.0 per specimen): 11 aerobic and facultative (1.6 per specimen) and 17 anaerobic (2.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in I instance (14%), anaerobes alone in 3 instances (43%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 3 instances (43%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 1 each). The predominant anaerobes included Peptostreptococcus spp (4 isolates), Prevotella spp (5), and Fusobacterium spp (4). These findings illustrate the unique microbiology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 15 acutely and 13 chronically infected frontal sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 20 isolates (1.3 per specimen) were recovered from the 15 cases of acute frontal sinusitis, 16 aerobic and facultative isolates (1.1 per specimen) and 4 anaerobic isolates (0.3 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 13 specimens (87%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 2 (13%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), and Moraxella catarrhalis (3). A total of 32 isolates were recovered from the 13 cases (2.5 per patient) of chronic frontal sinusitis, 12 aerobic and facultative isolates (0.9 per specimen) and 20 anaerobic isolates (1.5 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms only were recovered in 3 instances (23%), anaerobes only in 7 instances (54%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 3 instances (23%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (H influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The predominant anaerobes included Prevotella species (8), Peptostreptococcus species (6), and Fusobacterium species (4). These findings illustrate the microbiologic features of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (BL) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB). METHODS: The microbiology, BL production by the different isolates, and BL contents in the sputum were determined. RESULTS: Eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). Aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). The predominant aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (11), Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (19), Prevotella sp. (11), and Fusobacterium sp.(6). Mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. The predominant aerobic BLPB were H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobic BLPB were Prevotella sp. and Fusobacterium sp. Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which BLPB were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor BLPB. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid detection of BL activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with AECB.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal activities of new oral penem, faropenem against the various clinical isolates].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of faropenem (FRPM) more compared with those of various oral beta-lactams against 15 isolates each of 6 species of microorganism. FRPM possessed potent in vitro antibacterial activity against both aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria tested. FRPM showed the same activity as new oral cephems such as cefdinir, cefditoren and cefcapene against all Gram-negative bacteria, but K. pneumoniae strains were less susceptible. The MBC of FRPM against S. pneumoniae and the other strains tested equal and were within 1 dilution the MIC of that, respectively. These results suggest that FRPM has excellent in vitro bactericidal activity against clinical isolates and is a clinically useful for the chemotherapy of bacterial infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - Microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses.
AB  - To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses and correlate the results with predisposing factors, potential causes and routes of infection, clinical and laboratory data of 48 patients with liver abscesses and 29 with spleen abscesses treated between 1970 and 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. In liver abscesses, a total of 116 isolates (2.4 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 43 were aerobic and facultative species (0.9 isolates/specimen) and 73 were anaerobic species or microaerophilic streptococci (1.5 isolates/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 12 (25%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from eight (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 28 (58%); polymicrobial infection was present in 38 (79%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (11 isolates), Streptococcus group D (8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (13), Fusobacterium spp. (10), Clostridium spp. (10) and Prevotella spp. (4). There were 12 isolates of micro-aerophilic streptococci. S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were associated with trauma; Streptococcus group D, K. pneumoniae and Clostridium spp. with biliary disease; and Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with colonic disease. In splenic abscesses, a total of 56 isolates (1.9 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 23 were aerobic and facultative species (0.8 isolates/specimen), 31 were anaerobic species or micro-aerophilic streptococci (1.1 isolates/specimen) and two were Candida albicans. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from nine (31%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria from eight (28%), mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10 (34%) and C. albicans in two (7%); polymicrobial infection was present in 16 (55%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were E. coli (5 isolates), Proteus mirabilis (3), Streptococcus group D (3), K. pneumoniae (3) and S. aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (11 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Clostridium spp. (3). S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Streptococcus group D were associated with endocarditis, E. coli with urinary tract and abdominal infection, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with abdominal infection and Fusobacterium spp. with respiratory infection.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  - Clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. A total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. The traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). A total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp (113), Clostridium spp (78), Prevotella spp (58), and Fusobacterium spp (23). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (83), Staphylococcus aureus (61), Streptococcus pyogenes (27), Streptococcus group D (16), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16). The types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). S. aureus was isolated at all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). This study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infections after trauma in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from infections after trauma in children over a 20 year period. METHODS: Only specimens that were studied for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were included in the analysis. They were collected from seven separate centres in which the microbiology laboratories only accepted specimens that were properly collected without contamination and were submitted in appropriate transport media. Anaerobes and aerobic bacteria were cultured and identified using standard techniques. Clinical records were reviewed to identify post-trauma patients. RESULTS: From 1974 to 1994, 175 specimens obtained from 166 children with trauma showed bacterial growth. The trauma included blunt trauma (71), lacerations (48), bites (42), and open fractures (5). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 38 specimens (22%), aerobic bacteria only in 51 (29%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 86 (49%); 363 anaerobic (2.1/specimen) and 158 aerobic or facultative isolates (0.9/specimen) were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Peptostreptococcus spp (115 isolates), Prevotella spp (68), Fusobacterium spp (52), B fragilis group (42), and Clostridium spp (21). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Staph aureus (51), E coli (13), Ps aeruginosa (12), Str pyogenes (11) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9). Principal infections were: abscesses (52), bacteraemia (3), pulmonary infections (30, including aspiration pneumonia, tracheostomy associated pneumonia, empyema, and ventilator associated pneumonia), wounds (36, including cellulitis, post-traumatic wounds, decubitus ulcers, myositis, gastrostomy and tracheostomy site wounds, and fasciitis), bites (42, including 23 animal and 19 human), peritonitis (4), osteomyelitis (5), and sinusitis (3). Staph aureus and Str pyogenes were isolated at all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from head and neck wounds and abscesses, and bites, and those from the gastrointestinal tract predominated in infections that originated from peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, and decubitus ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: Many infections that follow trauma in children involve multiple organisms.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of various types of retroperitoneal abscesses was studied by review of the clinical and laboratory data for 161 patients treated between 1974 and 1990 for such abscesses. These included 109 anterior, 8 posterior, 21 retrofascial, and 23 pelvic retroperitoneal abscesses. A total of 472 organisms (2.9 isolates/specimen)--204 aerobic and facultative (1.3/specimen), and 268 anaerobic (1.7/specimen)--were recovered. Aerobes only were recovered from 34 abscesses (21%), anaerobes only from 34 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 93 (58%). Polymicrobial infection was present in 132 patients (82%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (60 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20), Streptococcus group D (19), and Staphylococcus aureus (11). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (95 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (66), Prevotella species (22), and Clostridium species (22). The number of anaerobes per site always was greater than the number of aerobic or facultative organisms and was especially high in pelvic abscesses. The number of aerobic and facultative organisms was especially high in pancreatic abscesses. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of retroperitoneal abscesses.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  - The microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. Aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (TT). The middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. Analysis of the 138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28 patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in 20 (36%). There were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. Commonly recovered aerobes were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (11), Proteus sp. (7), Moraxella catarrhalis (6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (5). Commonly isolated anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), Prevotella sp. (10), Bacteroides sp. (8) and Fusobacterium sp. (6). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of TT-related otorrhea in children. Specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. Reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the TT or through the open perforation after their removal.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic infection associated with malignancy.
AB  - The goal of this work was to study the microbiology and clinical characteristics  of patients with infections associated with malignancy treated over a period of 17 years. A total of 668 specimens were obtained from 605 patients. The malignancies include 224 hematological malignancies and 381 nonhematogenic malignancies. Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 201 (30%) specimens, aerobic bacteria in 226 (34%), mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacteria in 231 (35%) and Candida spp. in 10 (1%). A total of 683 anaerobic (1.0 isolates per specimens) and 592 aerobic or facultative (0.9 per specimen) organisms were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group isolates (181), Peptostreptococcus spp. (166), Prevotella spp. (106), Clostridium spp. (70), and Fusobacterium spp. (43). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (133), Staphylococcus aureus (100), Klebsiella pneumoniae (48), and Pseudomonas aeroginosa (45). The type of infections included abscesses (221), bacteremia (198), wounds (175), including 61 cellulitis, 24 post-surgical wounds and 23 decubitus ulcers), peritonitis (48), empyema (12), cholecystitis (6) and thrombophlebitis (5). S. aureus and Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora (Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp.) predominated in local infections and bacteremia that originated from this site (head and neck wounds and abscesses and pulmonary infections), and organisms of the gastrointestinal tract flora predominated in infections that originated from this site (peritonitis, abdominal abscesses and decubitus ulcers). This retrospective study demonstrates polymicrobial features of many infections associated with malignancies.
TI  - Microbiology of nosocomial sinusitis in mechanically ventilated children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the bacteriology of nosocomial sinusitis in mechanically ventilated children. METHOD: Retrospective review of sinus aspirate specimens obtained from 20 children with nosocomial sinusitis. The specimens were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: A total of 58 isolates (2.9 per specimen), 30 aerobic or facultative (1.5 per specimen) and 28 anaerobic (1.4 per specimen), were recovered. Aerobes only were present in 8 patients (40%), anaerobes only in 5 (25%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 7 (35%). The predominant aerobes were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (5 isolates), Escherichia coli (3 isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (8 isolates), Prevotella species (6 isolates), and Fusobacterium species (4 isolates). Forty-one beta-lactamase bacteria were recovered from 14 specimens (70%). Thirty isolates similar to the sinus isolates were also recovered from the trachea, 6 from blood culture specimens, and 6 from other sites. Anaerobes were more commonly isolated from sinus aspirate samples obtained after 18 days of mechanical ventilation (21 vs 7, P<.05 by chi2). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of nosocomial sinusitis in mechanically ventilated children.
TI  - Periodontal microflora of HIV infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in HIV seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. The subgingival microflora of 20 CDC II, 20 CDC III, 20 CDC IV/V and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. Four sites with greatest probing depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the HIV infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus micros. However, HIV seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloaca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Clostridium difficile, Aspergillus fumigatus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycoplasma incognitum. The lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in HIV infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1995 and June 1996].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and sixty-four strains were isolated from primary infections, and 202 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from post operative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-negative, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We noticed that MICs of cefazolin against three out of 23 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
TI  - Microbiology of acute purulent pericarditis. A 12-year experience in a military hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic micro-biological and clinical characteristics in 15 cases of acute pericarditis treated over a 12-year period. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data. SETTING: Military hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 7 specimens (47%), anaerobic bacteria alone in 6 specimens (40%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 2 specimens (13%). In total, there were 21 isolates: 10 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 11 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 1.4 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in patients with pericarditis who also had mediastinitis that followed esophageal perforation and in patients whose pericarditis was associated with orofacial and dental infections. The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 isolates), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were Prevotella species (4 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (3 isolates), and Propionibacterium acnes (2 isolates). CONCLUSION: The findings in our study highlight the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in acute pericarditis.
TI  - Microbiology of mediastinitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with mediastinitis. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 17 patients treated between 1980 and 1987. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in three patients (18%), anaerobic bacteria only in seven (41%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in seven (41%). In total, there were 42 isolates, 13 aerobic or facultative and 29 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 2.5 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in infections that originated from esophageal perforation and orofacial, odontogenic, and gunshot sources. The predominant aerobes were alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (three isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (two isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella and Porphyromonas species (eight isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (seven isolates), and Bacteroides fragilis group (three isolates). CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of mediastinitis.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic suppurative otitis media in children in Surabaya, Indonesia.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of 38 children from Surabaya, Indonesia, who suffered from chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) was studied using strict microbiological methodology. A total of 106 isolates (49 anaerobic and 57 aerobic) were recovered. Aerobic organisms alone were isolated from 11 (29%), anaerobic bacteria only in 4 (11%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were present in 23 (60%). The predominant organisms were Peptostreptococcus sp., Prevotella sp., Bacteroides sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Fusobacterium sp. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 22 (58%) patients. These findings demonstrate the role of penicillin resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial etiology of CSOM in children from Indonesia. Judicious use of antimicrobial therapy may prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - The bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. A prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  - Obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. In the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. From March 1992 to February 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. The obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. Chest ultrasound (US) and US-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. Microorganisms were isolated from seven of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. A total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, two Peptostreptococcus species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides species, Veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and Escherichia coli). In five cases the isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. The results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. Pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. The pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. Two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. Septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. The parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. The most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. In both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium sp. and Peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. High mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly Escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly Bacteroides fragilis. All antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. Metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. The lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. Finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  - Maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. These decisions can be life-saving. This study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. The results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. A protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  - In eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. The results showed that: a) in pure culture, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) Fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and/or Streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. It is concluded that Fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or known to be present in clinical specimens. This gnotobiotic animal model will be useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Formation of nitrogen-containing metabolites from geniposide and gardenoside by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - During the course of our studies on the metabolism of iridoid glycosides by human intestinal bacteria, we found that geniposide (1) and gardenoside (4) were transformed to new nitrogen-containing compounds, genipinine (3) and gardenine (6), respectively, along with the known aglycones. Although the amounts of new metabolites were somewhat lower than those of the aglycones, they were quantitatively analyzed by means of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Of 25 strains of human intestinal bacteria, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaotus produced appreciable amounts of 3, while a bacterial mixture of human feces produced 10 times or more higher amounts of 3, as compared to the individual strains.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - Microbial aspects of failing osseointegrated dental implants in humans.
AB  - The subgingival microflora of 18 failing implants were examined for pathogenic periodontal microorganisms. Peptostreptococcus micros was recovered from 6 failing implants, Wolinella recta from 6, Fusobacterium species from 5, Candida albicans from 5, and Bacteroides intermedius from 4. Enteric rods or pseudomonads constituted a significant part of the microflora in 5 failing implants. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, nonpigmented Bacteroides species, Capnocytophage species, and staphylococci were detected in a few implant failures. The present study showed that a complex microflora comprising oral as well as primarily non oral organisms, and bacteria as well as yeasts, can be associated with failing implants. This great diversity in microbial composition and antimicrobial susceptibility among "peri-implantitis" isolates suggest that antimicrobial therapies for implant failures should not be implemented without a prior comprehensive microbiological analysis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology. Study group of cefuzonam in the field of obstetrics and gynecological infections].
AB  - A multi-center open study was conducted to investigate cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) regarding to its pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical aspects in the field of obstetrics and gynecology with the participation of 31 medical institutions and the related facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Peak MICs of CZON for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase (-) staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis group, Peptostreptococcus spp. isolated from obstetrical and gynecological infections with relatively high frequencies were 0.39, 0.20, 0.024, 0.024-0.05, 12.5, 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively, with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. 2. When 1 g of CZON was given through bolus injection, the maximum concentration (Cmax) of CZON in pelvic dead space exudate was 18.7 micrograms/ml at 60.9 minutes (Tmax) after the injection; Cmax's in all female genital tissues were observed at 0.6-27.9 minutes and ranged from 11.9-26.3 micrograms/g. The Cmax 8.3 micrograms/ml, in the pelvic dead space exudate was noted at 97.0 minutes after the end of the intravenous drip infusion of 1 g over 1 hour, and Cmax's in genital tissues were 14.3-30.0 micrograms/g at the end of infusion. With 1 hour drip infusion of 2 g, Cmax's in genital tissues were 35.0-53.9 micrograms/g at the end of infusion. 3. The clinical efficacy of CZON was evaluated in 206 evaluable patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections. Efficacy rates classified by types of infections were 97.1% (67/69) for intrauterine infections, 81.6% (31/38) for intrapelvic infections, 91.8% (45/49) for adnexitis, 95.2% (20/21) for infections of the external genital organs and 86.2% (25/29) for other infections. 4. Side effects were observed in 7 of the 262 patients: eruption in 6 cases, itching in 2, diarrhea in 1. Abnormal laboratory test values were noted in 9 of the 256 patients. Most of them were slight elevation of hepatic function values. CZON showed satisfactory clinical efficacy and potent antibacterial activity, hence it appears that CZON will be a very useful antibiotic for obstetric and gynecologic infections.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefuzonam in obstetrics and gynecological infections].
AB  - To evaluate the usefulness and the safety of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) against obstetric and gynecological infections, we conducted clinical trials and obtained the results summarized as follows. 1. Thirteen patients with obstetric and gynecological infections (intrauterine infection 2 cases, adnexitis 7, 1 case each of abscess of adnexa uteri, abscess of the vaginal wall, pyelonephritis, and mammitis) were treated with CZON. The CZON was administered by intravenous injection or intravenous drip infusion, 1 g twice daily for 4 to 7 days (8 g to 14 g in total). The clinical effect was good in 12 and poor in 1. 2. Four cases, on which other antimicrobial agents were ineffective, responded well to CZON. 3. The CZON displayed excellent effects on anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis) and Gram negative rods (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae). 4. No side effects or laboratory abnormalities were observed. 5. From the above results, CZON appeared to be an effective and useful drug for obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK0787/MK0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. Clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. Efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. Major pathogens isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. Eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. No major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. The results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Production of menaquinones by intestinal anaerobes.
AB  - Ninety intestinal organisms (71 isolates from fecal samples of neutropenic patients with cancer or from various sites in patients with intraabdominal infections and 19 control strains) were examined by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography for their ability to produce menaquinones in vitro. Menaquinones were found in all of 24 organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Two other Bacteroides species, Bacteroides disiens and Bacteroides bivius, also produced menaquinones. A single isolate of Bacteroides species lacked menaquinones. These constituents were found in all of five strains of Escherichia coli, all of four strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, five of eight strains of Propionibacterium species, two of five strains of Eubacterium species, and the one strain each of Arachnia propionica and Veillonella parvula tested. No menaquinones were detected in organisms of the genera Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Peptococcus, or Peptostreptococcus. These findings suggest that E. coli, Bacteroides species, and some gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming bacilli produce menaquinones that may be a source of vitamin K in patients who are deprived of exogenous vitamin K1.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Bacteriology and therapy of lung abscess in children.
AB  - The bacteriology and clinical findings of ten pediatric patients with lung abscess are presented. Bacteriologic data were based on percutaneous transtracheal aspiration obtained before initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Anaerobic bacteria were present in all ten patients; in nine they were mixed with aerobic bacteria. The most frequent isolates were Peptostreptococcus (8), Peptococcus (5), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (6), and Bacteroides fragilis (3). The aerobic isolates most frequently recovered were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (4), and Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). Virtually all abscesses were located in dependent pulmonary segments. Antimicrobial therapy was guided by the bacteriologic findings and was successful in all instances.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
