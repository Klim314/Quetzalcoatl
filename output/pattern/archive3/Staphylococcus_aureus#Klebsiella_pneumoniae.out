pegylated ofloxacin nanoparticles render strong antibacterial activity against many clinically important human pathogens.
the rise of bacterial resistance against important drugs threatens their clinical utility. fluoroquinones, one of the most important classes of contemporary antibiotics has also reported to suffer bacterial resistance. since the general mechanism of bacterial resistance against fluoroquinone antibiotics (e.g. ofloxacin) consists of target mutations resulting in reduced membrane permeability and increased efflux by the bacteria, strategies that could increase bacterial uptake and reduce efflux of the drug would provide effective treatment. in the present study, we have compared the efficiencies of ofloxacin delivered in the form of free drug (ofx) and as nanoparticles on bacterial uptake and antibacterial activity. although both poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (ofx-plga) and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (ofx-mpeg-plga) nanoformulations presented improved bacterial uptake and antibacterial activity against all the tested human bacterial pathogens, namely, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus, ofx-mpeg-plga showed significantly higher bacterial uptake and antibacterial activity compared to ofx-plga. we have also found that mpeg-plga nanoencapsulation could significantly inhibit bacillus subtilis resistance development against ofx.
in vitro bactericidal activity of cefepime and cefpirome against clinical isolates at karachi.
antibiotics not only support to alleviate the infections but also facilitate to avert the multiplication of microbes. due to the irrational use of antibiotics, the resistance of antibiotics has been augmented which results may increase in morbidity and mortality with the span of time. world renowned regulatory bodies like food and drug administration (fda), center of disease control and prevention (cdc), and world health organization (who) vigorously advocate the surveillance of the resistance of antibiotics. during the present study by kirby-bauer disk diffusion method 141 clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n=47, 33.34%), escherichia coli (n=54, 38.3%), proteus species (n=26, 18.4%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=14, 9.92%) are evaluated against cefepime and cefpirome which comes of fourth generation cephalosporin. it has been found that cefpirome has better bactericidal activity than cefepime against e. coli and k. pneumoniae while cefepime has been possessed better antibacterial activity against s. aureus and proteus species which were isolated from respiratory tract infections, blood stream infection, intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. k. pneumoniae, e. coli, proteus species, and s. aureus were 34.8%, 26.3%, 11.3%, and 37.7% resistance against cefepime respectively. s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus species has shown 41.4%, 21.7%, 17.6%, and 8.9% resistance against cefpirome correspondingly.
bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
repurposing non-antimicrobial drugs and clinical molecules to treat bacterial infections.
there is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. the objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. a library, containing 727 fda approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobactercloacae). drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. the initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolates. two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against gram-negative pathogens. among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (eb) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (fdurd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus isolates including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa), and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa).the minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of s. aureus were inhibited (mic90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/l for eb and fdurd, respectively. treatment with eb orally significantly increased mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic mrsa-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. fdurd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. these data encourage screening and repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
metabolic pathways of pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in competition with respiratory bacterial pathogens.
background: chronic airway infection by pseudomonas aeruginosa considerably contributes to lung tissue destruction and impairment of pulmonary function in cystic-fibrosis (cf) patients. complex interplays between p. aeruginosa and other co-colonizing pathogens including staphylococcus aureus, burkholderia sp., and klebsiella pneumoniae may be crucial for pathogenesis and disease progression. methods: we generated a library of pa14 transposon insertion mutants to identify p. aeruginosa genes required for exploitative and direct competitions with s. aureus, burkholderia cenocepacia, and k. pneumoniae. results: whereas wild-type pa14 inhibited s. aureus growth, two transposon insertions located in pqsc and carb, resulted in reduced growth inhibition. pqsc is involved in the synthesis of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (haqs), a family of molecules having antibacterial properties, while carb is a key gene in pyrimidine biosynthesis. the carb mutant was also unable to grow in the presence of b. cepacia and k. pneumoniae but not escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. we further identified a transposon insertion in purf, encoding a key enzyme of purine metabolism. this mutant displayed a severe growth deficiency in the presence of gram-negative but not of gram-positive bacteria. we identified a beneficial interaction in a bioa transposon mutant, unable to grow on rich medium. this growth defect could be restored either by addition of biotin or by co-culturing the mutant in the presence of k. pneumoniae or e. coli. conclusion: complex interactions take place between the various bacterial species colonizing cf-lungs. this work identified both detrimental and beneficial interactions occurring between p. aeruginosa and three other respiratory pathogens involving several major metabolic pathways. manipulating these pathways could be used to interfere with bacterial interactions and influence the colonization by respiratory pathogens.
repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic): 0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.
trends in paediatric bloodstream infections at a south african referral hospital.
background: the epidemiology of paediatric bloodstream infection (bsi) in sub-saharan africa is poorly documented with limited data on hospital-acquired sepsis, impact of hiv infection, bsi trends and antimicrobial resistance. methods: we retrospectively reviewed paediatric bsi (0-14 years) at tygerberg children's hospital between 1 january 2008 and 31 december 2013 (excluding neonatal wards). laboratory and hospital data were used to determine bsi rates, blood culture contamination, pathogen profile, patient demographics, antimicrobial resistance and factors associated with mortality. fluconazole resistant candida species, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing enterobacteriaceae were classified as antimicrobial resistant pathogens. results: of 17001 blood cultures over 6 years, 935 cultures isolated 979 pathogens (5.5% yield; 95% ci 5.3-5.7%). contamination rates were high (6.6%, 95% ci 6.4-6.8%), increasing over time (p = 0.003). discrete bsi episodes were identified (n = 864) with median patient age of 7.5 months, male predominance (57%) and 13% hiv prevalence. bsi rates declined significantly over time (4.6-3.1, overall rate 3.5 per 1000 patient days; 95% ci 3.3-3.7; chi square for trend p = 0.02). gram negative pathogens predominated (60% vs 33% gram positives and 7% fungal); klebsiella pneumoniae (154; 17%), staphylococcus aureus (131; 14%) and escherichia coli (97; 11%) were most prevalent. crude bsi mortality was 20% (176/864); hiv infection, fungal, gram negative and hospital-acquired sepsis were significantly associated with mortality on multivariate analysis. hospital-acquired bsi was common (404/864; 47%). overall antimicrobial resistance rates were high (70% in hospital vs 25% in community-acquired infections; p < 0.0001); hospital-acquired infection, infancy, hiv-infection and gram negative sepsis were associated with resistance. s. pneumoniae bsi declined significantly over time (58/465 [12.5%] to 33/399 [8.3%]; p =0.04). conclusion: although bsi rates declined over time, children with bsi had high mortality and pathogens exhibited substantial antimicrobial resistance in both community and hospital-acquired infections. blood culture sampling technique and local options for empiric antimicrobial therapy require re-evaluation.
[mrsa and esbl in outpatient: development from 2008 up to 2012 and socio demographic differences].
data on resistance from ambulatory care are rarely available, since surveillance  systems cover mostly isolates come from inpatient care. the outpatient setting is of interest, however, since it is where hospitalized patients with resistant pathogens are also treated as outpatients, and where patients are seen who have resistant pathogens from other sources, such as food. in addition, 85% of the antibiotics used in human medicine, are used in ambulatory care. using data from the antibiotic resistance surveillance system (ars), we show the development of resistance of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin and of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae to cefotaxime in outpatient care between 2008 and 2012 and corresponding socio-demographic differences in the resistance rate. according to our analyses, the proportion of mrsa in s. aureus since 2009 in the outpatient sector decreased (all materials: 2009 11.5%, 2012 9.8%), which is similar to inpatient care, while the proportion of esbl in e. coli (2008 2.7%, 2012 5.6%), and k. pneumoniae (2008 2.7%, 2012 6.6%) increased over the total period. at the same time resistance for the three pathogens in both sexes over the age groups continuously increased, women still hold a lower proportion of resistance than men. the resistance levels of s. aureus and k. pneumoniae in ambulatory care are reflected at a lower level than in hospital care. in contrast, the high proportion of resistant e. coli in children suggests another source in ambulatory care.
antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
rapid automated microscopy for microbiological surveillance of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
rationale: diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is imprecise. objectives: to (1) determine whether alternate-day surveillance mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (mini-bal) in ventilated adults could reduce time to initiation of targeted treatment and (2) evaluate the potential for automated microscopy to reduce analysis time. methods: adult intensive care unit patients who were anticipated to require ventilation for at least a further 48 hours were included. mini-bals were processed for identification, quantitation, and antibiotic susceptibility, using (1) clinical culture (50 +/- 7 h) and (2) automated microscopy ( approximately 5 h plus offline analysis). measurements and main results: seventy-seven mini-bals were performed in 33 patients. one patient (3%) was clinically diagnosed with vap. of 73 paired samples, culture identified 7 containing pneumonia panel bacteria (>10(4) colony-forming units/ml) from five patients (15%) (4 staphylococcus aureus [3 methicillin-resistant s. aureus], 2 stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 1 klebsiella pneumoniae) and resulted in antimicrobial changes/additions to two of five (40%) of those patients. microscopy identified 7 of 7 microbiologically positive organisms and 64 of 66 negative samples compared with culture. antimicrobial responses were concordant in four of five comparisons. antimicrobial changes/additions would have occurred in three of seven microscopy-positive patients (43%) had those results been clinically available in 5 hours, including one patient diagnosed later with vap despite negative mini-bal cultures. conclusions: microbiological surveillance detected infection in patients at risk for vap independent of clinical signs, resulting in changes to antimicrobial therapy. automated microscopy was 100% sensitive and 97% specific for high-risk pneumonia organisms compared with clinical culturing. rapid microscopy-based surveillance may be informative for treatment and antimicrobial stewardship in patients at risk for vap.
in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
microwave-assisted synthesis of cdo-zno nanocomposite and its antibacterial activity against human pathogens.
cdo-zno nanocomposite was prepared by microwave-assisted method and characterized by x-ray crystallography (xrd), scanning electron microscopy (sem) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir). it exhibits hexagonal cubic structure with an average crystallite size of 27 nm. from the uv-vis spectra, the bandgap is estimated as 2.92 ev. the fluorescence spectrum shows a near band edge emission at 422 nm. in addition the antibacterial activity of cdo-zno nanocomposite was carried out in-vitro against two kinds of bacteria: gram negative bacteria (g -ve) i.e. escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and gram positive bacteria (g +ve): staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris and bacillus spp. this study indicates the zone of inhibition of 40 mm has high antibacterial activity towards the gram positive bacterium s. aureus.
in vitro antimicrobial analysis of aqueous humor after topical application of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%.
purpose: to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of aqueous humor in patients who had preoperative topical application of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%. setting: department of ophthalmology, santa casa de misericordia de sao paulo, brazil. design: comparative case series. methods: twenty-nine eyes from 29 cataract surgery patients were included in this study. in the study group (n = 15 eyes), 3 topical applications of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5% were administered preoperatively; in the control group (n = 14 eyes), no topical applications were administered. aqueous humor samples were collected and stored in sterile microtubes at -80 degrees c until analysis. antimicrobial analysis was performed using standard strains with standard sterile filter paper disks. inhibition halos were measured in millimeters, and both bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects were analyzed. results: inhibition halos were observed on most of the study group plates except those with streptococcus pneumoniae: escherichia coli (13.93 mm +/- 0.64 [sd]), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.63 +/- 0.61 mm), staphylococcus aureus (7.47 +/- 0.68 mm), and s epidermidis (4.20 +/- 3.33 mm) the differences between the mean inhibition halo diameters were statistically significant (p < .0001) in all samples. no bactericidal effect was observed against any of the microorganisms studied. conclusions: after topical application of moxifloxacin 0.5%, aqueous humor showed bacteriostatic effect against e coli, k pneumoniae, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no bactericidal effect was observed against any of the microorganisms evaluated. no antimicrobial effect against s pneumoniae was observed. financial disclosure: no author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of a. retroflexus.
in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 mul/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtills, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (candida albicans, c. famata, c. utilis, saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (mic determination) for antimicrobial activity and teac (trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. the adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of a. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. the extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against k. pneumoniae and b. subtilis with no activity against s. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against c. famata by both extracts. the a. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the p. aeruginosa clinical strain. the inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on b. subtilis strain. the antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.
[trends in antibiotic resistance in medellin and municipalities of the metropolitan area between 2007 and 2012: results of six years of surveillance].
introduction: bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. objective: to determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in medellin and its metropolitan area. materials and methods: percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using whonet 5.6 program. for interpretation of susceptibility results, clsi standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. using the epi-info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. results: in six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). in escherichia coli and serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). k. pneumoniae , s. marcescens and e. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii . conclusions: the resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae . it is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
synergistic antibacterial activity of the combination of the alkaloid sanguinarine with edta and the antibiotic streptomycin against multidrug resistant bacteria.
objectives: drug combinations consisting of the dna intercalating benzophenanthridine alkaloid sanguinarine, the chelator edta with the antibiotic streptomycin were tested against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multi-resistant clinical isolates. methods: microdilution, checkerboard and time kill curve methods were used to investigate the antibacterial activity of the individual drugs and the potential synergistic activity of combinations. key findings: sanguinarine demonstrated a strong activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (minimum inhibitory concentrations, mic = 0.5-128 mug/ml), while streptomycin was active against gram-negative strains (mic = 2-128 mug/ml). edta showed only bacteriostatic activity. indifference to synergistic activity was seen in the two-drug combinations sanguinarine + edta and sanguinarine + streptomycin (fractional inhibitory concentration index = 0.1-1.5), while the three-drug combination of sanguinarine + edta + streptomycin showed synergistic activity against almost all the strains (except methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), as well as a strong reduction in the effective doses (dose reduction index = 2-16 times) of sanguinarine, edta and streptomycin. in time kill studies, a substantial synergistic interaction of the three-drug combination was detected against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. conclusions: the combination of drugs, which interfere with different molecular targets, can be an important strategy to combat multidrug resistant bacteria.
trends and correlation of antibacterial usage and bacterial resistance: time series analysis for antibacterial stewardship in a chinese teaching hospital (2009-2013).
the purpose of this investigation was to describe the effect of antibacterial stewardship and evaluate the trends and correlation of antibacterial resistance and usage from 2009 to 2013 in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in northwest china. antibacterial usage was expressed as defined daily doses per 100 patients per day (ddds/100 pds). hospital-wide population-level data and time series analysis were used to evaluate the trends and determine associations between antibacterial exposure and acquisition of resistance. yearly consumption of overall antibacterials significantly decreased from 66.54 to 28.08 ddds/100 pds (beta = -10.504, p < 0.01). the resistant rates of the five most frequently isolated species (including escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) significantly decreased or remained stable, and none of them showed a statistically significant upward trend. the medical quality indicators got better or remained stable. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models demonstrated that the monthly resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to imipenem was strongly correlated with antipseudomonal carbapenems usage (beta = 34.94, p < 0.001), as did the correlation of p. aeruginosa to meropenem with antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins usage (beta = 32.76, p < 0.01) and k. pneumoniae to amikacin with aminoglycosides usage (beta = 22.01, p < 0.001). the decreased antibacterial use paralleled the improved bacterial resistance without deteriorating medical quality indicators during antimicrobial stewardship. it also suggests that optimum antibiotic use is necessary to alleviate the threat posed by resistant microorganisms at the hospital level.
antioxidant and antibacterial potential of pomegranate peel extracts.
pomegranate peels of ganesh variety were subjected to extraction using different  solvents viz. water, methanol and ethanol either alone or in combination with water. the extraction yield, antioxidant activity (dpph and abts inhibition) and total phenolic contents were evaluated. highest yield was obtained from 50 % ethanol: 50 % water (16.3 +/- 1.99 %). the dpph and abts inhibition activity was found to be the highest for methanol and 70 % ethanol: 30 % water extract (79.5 +/- 6.5; 94.6 +/- 6.10), respectively. the phenolic content was the highest in the aqueous extract (438.3 +/- 14.15). the antibacterial activity of peel extracts was tested against four bacterial strains, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae and the extracts demonstrated remarkable antibacterial activities against all the tested bacterial strains. the 70 % ethanol: 30 % water and 100 % water extract had a higher antioxidant activity and phenolic content and has the potential for nutraceutical application.
antimicrobial potential of helicanthus elastica (desr.) danser - a less explored  indian mistletoe growing on mango trees.
helicanthus elastica (desr.) danser (loranthaceae) is a less-known medicinally important mistletoe species occurring in india. it is used to check abortion, and also in vesical calculi and kidney affections. there are no detailed studies reporting the antimicrobial potential of this plant. based on the traditional use and the rich phenolic composition of the whole plant, the antimicrobial property of the alcohol extract was analyzed and the results are outlined in the present paper. for the analysis, zone of inhibition, and minimum inhibitory concentration were used, and the total activity was assayed by standard methodologies. the antimicrobial activity was studied against bacteria like aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes, vibrio fischeri, and a fungus candida albicans. of the eight tested bacteria, the alcoholic extract of h. elastica was found to be active against k. pneumoniae, a. hydrophila, e. coli, and v. fischeri at concentration ranging from 250 to 500 mug/ml. c. albicans showed inhibition only at a concentration of 2000 mug/ml.
efficiency of vanilla, patchouli and ylang ylang essential oils stabilized by iron oxide@c14 nanostructures against bacterial adherence and biofilms formed by staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae clinical strains.
biofilms formed by bacterial cells are associated with drastically enhanced resistance against most antimicrobial agents, contributing to the persistence and chronicization of the microbial infections and to therapy failure. the purpose of this study was to combine the unique properties of magnetic nanoparticles with the antimicrobial activity of three essential oils to obtain novel nanobiosystems that could be used as coatings for catheter pieces with an improved resistance to staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae clinical strains adherence and biofilm development. the essential oils of ylang ylang, patchouli and vanilla were stabilized by the interaction with iron oxide@c14 nanoparticles to be further used as coating agents for medical surfaces. iron oxide@c14 was prepared by co-precipitation of fe+2 and fe+3 and myristic acid (c14) in basic medium. vanilla essential oil loaded nanoparticles pelliculised on the catheter samples surface strongly inhibited both the initial adherence of s. aureus cells (quantified at 24 h) and the development of the mature biofilm quantified at 48 h. patchouli and ylang-ylang essential oils inhibited mostly the initial adherence phase of s. aureus biofilm development. in the case of k. pneumoniae, all tested nanosystems exhibited similar efficiency, being active mostly against the adherence k. pneumoniae cells to the tested catheter specimens. the new nanobiosystems based on vanilla, patchouli and ylang-ylang essential oils could be of a great interest for the biomedical field, opening new directions for the design of film-coated surfaces with anti-adherence and anti-biofilm properties.
membrane active phenylalanine conjugated lipophilic norspermidine derivatives with selective antibacterial activity.
natural and synthetic membrane active antibacterial agents offer hope as potential solutions to the problem of bacterial resistance as the membrane-active nature imparts low propensity for the development of resistance. in this report norspermidine based antibacterial molecules were developed that displayed excellent antibacterial activity against various wild-type bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative) and drug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and beta-lactam-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae). in a novel structure-activity relationship study it has been shown how incorporation of an aromatic amino acid drastically improves selective antibacterial activity. additionally, the effect of stereochemistry on activity, toxicity, and plasma stability has also been studied. these rapidly bactericidal, membrane active antibacterial compounds do not trigger development of resistance in bacteria and hence bear immense potential as therapeutic agents to tackle multidrug resistant bacterial infections.
nitrile versus latex for glove juice sampling.
the objective of this study was to explore the utility of nitrile gloves as a replacement for latex surgical gloves in recovering bacteria from the hands. two types of nitrile gloves were compared to latex gloves using the parallel streak method. streaks of klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were made on tryptic soy agar plates, and the zones of inhibition were measured around pieces of glove material placed on the plates. latex gloves produced a mean zone of inhibition of 0.28 mm, compared to 0.002 mm for nitrile gloves (p<.001). while the parallel streak method is not intended as a quantitative estimate of antimicrobial properties, these results suggest that nitrile may be a viable alternative to latex in glove juice sampling methods, since nitrile avoids the risk of latex exposure.

objective: to determine the potential antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts from mentha longifolia l. (m. longifolia) and hydroalcoholic extract of zataria multiflora boiss. (z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. methods: pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella dysenteriae, klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumonia), enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of m. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. results: the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/ml) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/ml) were observed by the aqueous extracts of m. longifolia. conclusions: in conclusion, it seems that z. multiflora and m. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
antimicrobial activity of fermented theobroma cacao pod husk extract.
theobroma cacao l. contains more than 500 different chemical compounds some of which have been traditionally used for their antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, immunomodulatory, vasodilatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial activities. spontaneous aerobic fermentation of cacao husks yields a crude husk extract (che) with antimicrobial activity. che was fractioned by solvent partition with polar solvent extraction or by silica gel chromatography and a total of 12 sub-fractions were analyzed for chemical composition and bioactivity. che was effective against the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and the basidiomycete moniliophthora perniciosa. antibacterial activity was determined using 6 strains: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis (gram-positive) and pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella choleraesuis (gram-negative). at doses up to 10 mg/ml, che was not effective against the gram-positive bacteria tested but against medically important p. aeruginosa and s. choleraesuis with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 5.0 mg/ml. sub-fractions varied widely in activity and strongest antibacterial activity was seen with che8 against s. choleraesuis (mic of 1.0 mg/ml) and che9 against s. epidermidis (mic of 2.5 mg/ml). all bioactive che fractions contained phenols, steroids, or terpenes, but no saponins. fraction che9 contained flavonoids, phenolics, steroids, and terpenes, amino acids, and alkaloids, while che12 had the same compounds but lacked flavonoids.
functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
in this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (amps; pl-5, pl-31, pl-32, pl-18, pl-29 and pl-26), alone or in combination, against three gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis) and three gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. in addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and pl-5 against staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. traditional antibiotics and amps showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro. a strong synergistic effect in the pl-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. the mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of amps and traditional antibiotics. the combination of amps and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections, particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.
bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
platelet-rich plasma affects bacterial growth in vitro.
background aims: platelet-rich plasma (prp), a blood derivative rich in platelets, is a relatively new technique used in tissue regeneration and engineering. the increased quantity of platelets makes this formulation of considerable value for their role in tissue healing and microbicidal activity. this activity was investigated against five of the most important strains involved in nosocomial infections (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis) to understand the prophylactic role of pure (p)-prp. microbicidal proteins released from activated p-prp platelets were also determined. methods: the microbicidal activity of p-prp and platelet-poor plasma (ppp) was evaluated on different concentrations of the five bacterial strains incubated for 1, 2, 4 and 18 h and plated on agar for 18-24 h. p-prp and ppp-released microbicidal proteins were evaluated by means of multiplex bead-based immunoassays. results: p-prp and ppp inhibited bacterial growth for up to 2 h of incubation. the effect of p-prp was significantly higher than that of ppp, mainly at the low seeding concentrations and/or shorter incubation times, depending on the bacterial strain. chemokine (c-c motif) ligand-3, chemokine (c-c motif) ligand-5 and chemokine (c-x-c motif) ligand-1 were the molecules mostly related to pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis inhibition. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were less influenced. conclusions: the present results show that p-prp might supply an early protection against bacterial contaminations during surgical interventions because the inhibitory activity is already evident from the first hour of treatment, which suggests that physiological molecules supplied in loco might be important in the time frame needed for the activation of the innate immune response.
indolylmethylene benzo[h]thiazolo[2,3-b]quinazolinones: synthesis, characterization and evaluation of anticancer and antimicrobial activities.
a series of novel 10-((1h-indol-3-yl)methylene)-7-aryl-7,10-dihydro-5h-benzo[h]thiazolo[2,3-b]quina zolin-9(6h)-ones (8a-t) have been synthesized in good yields by the reaction of benzo[h]quinazoline-2(1h)-thiones (4a-f) with 2-chloro-n-phenylacetamide (5) followed by knoevenagel condensation with various indole-3-carbaldehydes (7a-d) under conventional method. all the synthesized compounds were characterized by spectral studies and screened for their in vitro anticancer and antimicrobial activities. compound 8c has exhibited excellent activity against mcf-7 (breast cancer cell line) than the standard drug doxorubicin. compound 8d against both the cancer cell lines, 8q against mcf-7 and 8c, 8h against hepg2 have also shown good activity. remaining compounds have shown moderate activity against both the cell lines. antimicrobial activity revealed that, the compound 8q and 8t against staphylococcus aureus and 8i, 8k, 8l, 8q &8t against klebsiella pneumoniae have shown equipotent activity on comparing with the standard drug streptomycin. remaining compounds have shown significant antibacterial and comparable antifungal activities against all the tested microorganisms.
synthesis of 2,3,6-trideoxy sugar triazole hybrids as potential new broad spectrum antimicrobial agents.
here, we describe a molecular hybridization inspired design and synthesis of novel 6-triazolyl 2,3,6-trideoxy sugars as promising new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents using click chemistry in key step. these compounds showed mic between 0.39 and 50 mug/ml against different native and resistant bacteria and fungi with no toxicity. among them, compound 29 was the most active molecule with mic 0.78 mug/ml against staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae and 3.12 mug/ml against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant s. aureus. compound 26 was the most potent anti-fungal candidate with mic 0.39 mug/ml against trichophyton mentagrophytes. compound 46 was found to be promising with broad-spectrum activity against both bacterial and fungal strains. the bioinformatic studies involving bacteria's protein co-crystals prompted penicillin binding protein-2 as the most likely target of these compounds.
the in vitro antibacterial effect of s53p4 bioactive glass and gentamicin impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads.
osteomyelitis is a disease that is still difficult to treat, with considerable morbidity and associated costs. the current "gold standard" in treatment - debridement and implantation of antibiotic impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) beads - presents the disadvantage of a second surgical intervention required for the removal of the beads. we comparatively investigated the in vitro antibacterial effect of s53p4 bioactive glass (bag) and gentamicin impregnated pmma beads. bacterial viability was assessed hourly by standard plate count during 24 hours of incubation, by determining the number of colony forming units (cfu) of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. both tested materials showed an antibacterial effect on all studied bacteria. in case of s. aureus, bag granules were almost as effective as gentamicin impregnated pmma beads, with no statistically significant differences. in contrast, pmma beads had a superior antibacterial effect on s. epidermidis and k. pneumoniae. the antibacterial effect of bag was greatly influenced by granule size and contact time. there was a statistically significant correlation between ph values and the number of cfu in the case of s53p4 bag granules. as a biocompatible and biodegradable bone substitute, s53p4 bioactive glass can be a good alternative in the local management of osteomyelitis.
toxicity of magnetic chitosan micro and nanoparticles as carriers for biologically active substances.
nanoparticles of inorganic magnetic core surrounded by layers of functional coatings are potential representatives of nanostructures for immobilization of bio-substances. magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) are often bound in aggregates due to a strong magnetic dipole, which has a lot of advantages, such as large surface area for binding biologically active substances. chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer that is non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and has hydroxy and amino groups in its structure. because of these chemical and biological properties it is a desirable bio-product for immobilization of enzymes and for binding of other biologically active substances. magnetic micro and nanoparticles were synthesized with chitosan by three different methods; microemulsion process, suspension cross-linking technique and covalent binding of chitosan. toxic effect of the prepared magnetic particles was determined as well and was examined on five different bacterial cultures; escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. at concentrations of 10-30 mg of magnetic particles per 0.5 mcfarland standard solution of e. coli and per 400 cfu of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis in k. pneumonia, no inhibition on the chosen bacterial cultures was detected.
next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. such wounds then become chronically infected. topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of next science wound gel technology (nxtsc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. in vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that nxtsc inhibited biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. the gel formulation nxtsc-g5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 cfu/disc or cfu/g. in vivo, nxtsc-g5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. storage of nxtsc-g5 at room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. these results establish that nxtsc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. this novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life, shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.
novel benzoxazoles: synthesis and antibacterial, antifungal, and antitubercular activity against antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive microbes.
a new series of 5-(p-substituted benzamido/phenylacetamido)-2-(p-tert-butylphenyl)benzoxazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial, antifungal, and antimycobacterial activities against antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as against candida albicans and candida krusei. the compounds possessed broad-spectrum activity against all of the tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeasts, their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging between 16-128 microg/ml. one compound exhibited significant antibacterial activity (16 microg/ml) against an antibiotic-resistant enterococcus faecalis isolate, having twice the potency of the compared standard drugs vancomycin and gentamycin sulfate. the compounds also showed moderate antitubercular activity with mic values between 8-128 microg/ml against mycobacterium tuberculosis and its clinical isolate.
in vitro activity of plazomicin against 5,015 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals as part of the canward study, 2011-2012.
plazomicin is a next-generation aminoglycoside that is not affected by most clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. the in vitro activities of plazomicin and comparator antimicrobials were evaluated against a collection of 5,015 bacterial isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between january 2011 and october 2012. susceptibility testing was performed using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method, with mics interpreted according to clsi breakpoints, when available. plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with all species except proteus mirabilis having an mic90 of </=1 mug/ml. plazomicin was active against aminoglycoside-nonsusceptible escherichia coli, with mic50 and mic90 values identical to those for aminoglycoside-susceptible isolates. furthermore, plazomicin demonstrated equivalent activities versus extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-esbl-producing e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, with 90% of the isolates inhibited by an mic of </=1 mug/ml. the mic50 and mic90 values for plazomicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa were 4 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively, compared with 4 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively, for amikacin. plazomicin had an mic50 of 8 mug/ml and an mic90 of 32 mug/ml versus 64 multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates. plazomicin was active against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, with both having mic50 and mic90 values of 0.5 mug/ml and 1 mug/ml, respectively. in summary, plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a diverse collection of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci obtained over a large geographic area. these data support further evaluation of plazomicin in the clinical setting.
antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline combined with avibactam tested against bacterial organisms isolated from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections in united states medical centers (2010-2012).
ceftaroline-avibactam and comparator agents were tested against clinical isolates collected at 174 medical centers from patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (absssi) in the united states (usa) during 2010-2012. isolates were processed at the medical centers and forwarded to a central laboratory for confirmatory identification and susceptibility testing using reference methods. ceftaroline-avibactam was highly active against methicillin-susceptible (mic50/90, 0.25/0.25 mug/ml) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml). vancomycin, tigecycline, daptomycin, and linezolid were also active (>99.9% susceptible) against mrsa (51.4% of s. aureus), but activity against mrsa was decreased for erythromycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin (10.8, 40.3, and 81.9% susceptible, respectively). beta-hemolytic streptococci were highly susceptible to beta-lactam antimicrobials, including ceftaroline-avibactam (mic50/90, </=0.03/</=0.03 mug/ml). ceftaroline-avibactam was very active against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 and 0.06/0.25 mug/ml, respectively) including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) screen-positive phenotypes (mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 and 0.12/1 mug/ml, respectively). susceptibility of esbl screen-positive e. coli and k. pneumoniae was 100.0/97.9% for tigecycline and 99.2/56.1% for meropenem, respectively. susceptibility to other agents for esbl screen-positive e. coli and k. pneumoniae was decreased. ceftaroline-avibactam exhibited a broad-spectrum of in vitro activity against isolates from patients in the usa with absssi including mrsa, beta-hemolytic streptococci, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae as well as esbl screen-positive phenotype isolates and merits further study in clinical indications where these resistant organisms may be a concern.
seasonal shifts in bacteria associated with jersey cows on a small dairy farm and the potential for bedding choice and low levels of iodine use to inhibit mastitic pathogens.
milk products from small dairies are increasingly in demand, as access to pasture provides benefits to the cow, consumer, and environment. the productivity and profitability of small dairy farms particularly rely on the prevention of infectious diseases. cattle on seasonal grazing dairies live primarily outdoors until inclement weather warrants relocation indoors. while shifts in the amounts of bacteria associated with livestock may be expected from this transition, potentially increasing risks for infectious diseases, changes in bacteria levels on cows relocated to indoor facilities have not been well-studied. in addition, the optimal use of bedding materials and iodine are critical in bovine infectious diseases prevention. however, the antibacterial potential of bedding material with high polyphenol content or low concentrations of iodine, are poorly understood. cow teats were swabbed and total bacteria and coliform counts, as well as extracellular enzyme activities (eea) were utilized to assess shifts in bacterial levels on cows at pasture and then housed indoors. to test the antibacterial efficacy of bedding materials, as well as low concentrations of povidone-iodine, growth curves with laboratory strains of staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as s. aureus isolated from a dairy farm, were performed with three concentrations of red cedar shavings or iodine. post hoc multiple comparisons indicated that total bacteria, coliform, and beta-galactosidase activities were significantly greater among cows housed indoors compared to bacterial samples from cows at pasture. laboratory strains of s. aureus, but not k. pneumoniae, were significantly inhibited by moderate and high treatments of red cedar shavings, while s. aureus isolated from a dairy were inhibited by the high treatment only. all low iodine concentrations significantly inhibited each bacterial strain investigated. these results may help optimize strategies for the prevention of infectious diseases of bovine udders critical to the productivity and profitability of small dairies.
antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of dispersinb(r)-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
the medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. as the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of dispersinb((r)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum ksl-w antimicrobial peptide. the combination of dispersinb((r)) and ksl-w peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and acinetobacter baumannii. in addition, the wound gel formulation comprising dispersinb((r)), ksl-w peptide, and a gelling agent pluronic f-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel silver-sept, dispersinb((r))-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded mrsa, s. epidermidis, cons, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, a. baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.05). thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial dispersinb((r))-ksl-w wound gel in chronic wound management.
analysis of community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia during a recent 5-year period.
there are sparse data concerning sex- and age-specific characteristics of community-acquired bacteraemia (cab) and hospital-acquired bacteraemia (hab). between january 2008 and december 2012, we identified 2956 bacteraemia cases, which we classified as cab, hab or healthcare-associated bacteraemia (hcab). almost half of the pathogens were escherichia coli in cab patients. by contrast, staphylococcus aureus was most frequent (16.2%) in hab patients. hcab showed mixed features of cab and hab. in cab, e. coli was significantly more abundant in females than in males (56.9 vs 24.3%, respectively). this trend was most striking in young adults (20-39 years) (77.2% in females vs 11.4% in males). hab cases showed greater heterogeneity in their associated pathogens. the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive rates of e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, were 31.3 and 33.8% in hab and 8.8 and 8.4% in cab. the non-susceptibility rates of s. aureus to oxacillin were 37.4% in cab and 73.0% in hab. in conclusion, cab and hab showed different distributions of micro-organisms, and these distributions also differed with patient age and sex. in addition, antimicrobial susceptibility needs to be monitored separately.
could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.
evaluation of antibacterial properties of barium zirconate titanate (bzt) nanoparticle.
so far, the antibacterial activity of some organic and inorganic compounds has been studied. barium zirconate titanate [ba(zrxti(1)-x)o(3)] (x = 0.05) nanoparticle is an example of inorganic materials. in vitro studies have provided evidence for the antibacterial activity of this nanoparticle. in the current study, the nano-powder was synthesized by sol-gel method. x-ray diffraction showed that the powder was single-phase and had a perovskite structure at the calcination temperature of 1000 degrees c. antibacterial activity of the desired nanoparticle was assessed on two gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus ptcc1431 and micrococcus luteus ptcc1625) and two gram-negative (escherichia coli hp101ba 7601c and clinically isolated klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria according to radial diffusion assay (rda). the results showed that the antibacterial activity of bzt nano-powder on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was acceptable. the minimum inhibitory concentration of this nano-powder was determined. the results showed that mic values for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, m. luteus and s. aureus were about 2.3 mug/ml, 7.3 mug/ml, 3 mug/ml and 12 mug/ml, respectively. minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was also evaluated and showed that the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, m. luteus and s. aureus could be decreased at 2.3, 14, 3 and 18 mug/ml of bzt. average log reduction in viable bacteria count in time-kill assay ranged between 6 log(1)(0) cfu/ml to zero after 24 h of incubation with bzt nanoparticle.
antibacterial activity of 2-alkynoic fatty acids against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
the first study aimed at determining the structural characteristics needed to prepare antibacterial 2-alkynoic fatty acids (2-afas) was accomplished by synthesizing several 2-afas and other analogs in 18-76% overall yields. among all the compounds tested, the 2-hexadecynoic acid (2-hda) displayed the best overall antibacterial activity against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (mic=15.6 mug/ml), staphylococcus saprophyticus (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and bacillus cereus (mic=31.3 mug/ml), as well as against the gram-negative klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8 mug/ml) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic=125 mug/ml). in addition, 2-hda displayed significant antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) atcc 43300 (mic=15.6 mug/ml) and clinical isolates of mrsa (mic=3.9 mug/ml). no direct relationship was found between the antibacterial activity of 2-afas and their critical micelle concentration (cmc) suggesting that the antibacterial properties of these fatty acids are not mediated by micelle formation. it was demonstrated that the presence of a triple bond at c-2 and the carboxylic acid moiety in 2-afas are important for their antibacterial activity. 2-hda has the potential to be further evaluated for use in antibacterial formulations.
synthesis and characterization of new n-(4-(4-chloro-1h-imidazol-1-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)amide/sulfonamide derivatives as possible antimicrobial and antitubercular agents.
in this paper we report the sar studies of a series of n-(4-(4-chloro-1h-imidazol-1-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)amide and n-(4-(4-chloro-1h-imidazol-1-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)sulfonamide derivatives 6(a-o) and 7(a-o), were synthesized in good yields and characterized by (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr and mass spectral analyses. the preparation of the key intermediate highlights an optimized palladium catalyzed (pd(2)(dba)(3)/ruphos) buchwald cross-coupling of intermediate 2 and 3. the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, (gram-positive), escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (gram-negative), antifungal activity against candida albicans, aspergillus flavus and rhizopus sp. and antitubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv, mycobacterium smegmatis, mycobacterium fortuitum and mdr-tb strains. the synthesized compounds displayed interesting antimicrobial activity. the compounds 7d, 7f, 7h and 7n displayed significant activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv strain.
antibacterial activity of the roots, stems and leaves of alchornea floribunda.
ethnopharmacological relevance: alchornea floribunda mull. arg. is used in traditional medicine across africa for the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and inflammatory disorders. aim of the study: to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the crude extracts of different plant parts in order to provide a scientific rationale for the proposed broad efficacy of alchornea floribunda in the treatment of bacterial infections. materials and methods: extracts of roots, stems and leaves were prepared using solvents of various polarities in order to extract a wide range of phytochemicals. the antibacterial activity of these crude extracts was evaluated by micro-dilution assay, against gram-positive (i.e. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus saprophyticus) as well as gram-negative (i.e. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and proteus mirabilis) bacteria. results: generally, the ethanol (etoh), methanol (meoh), ethyl acetate (etoac) and chloroform (chcl3) extracts demonstrated the best activities, with the leaves exhibiting the highest average activity for six of the eight pathogens. of these, the ethanolic leaf extract was the most active against staphylococcus aureus with an mic value of 50microg/ml. some other notable activity was observed for the ethyl acetate and chloroform root extracts against staphylococcus aureus (50microg/ml), and for selected stem extracts against staphylococcus aureus (50microg/ml), klebsiella pneumoniae (63microg/ml) and staphylococcus saprophyticus (63microg/ml). conclusion: this study demonstrates the promising antibacterial activity of alchornea floribunda against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary ailments, and validates its use in the ethnopharmacology of the region.
in vitro effectiveness of the antimicrobial peptide ecath1 against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens of horses.
the equine antimicrobial peptide ecath1 previously has been shown to have in vitro activity against antibiotic-susceptible reference strains of rhodococcus equi and common respiratory bacterial pathogens of foals. interestingly, ecath1 was also found to be effective in the treatment of r. equi infection induced in mice. the aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of ecath1 against equine isolates of gram-negative (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas spp.) and gram-positive (r. equi, staphylococcus aureus) bacteria resistant to multiple classes of conventional antibiotics. a modified microdilution method was used to evaluate the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the antimicrobial peptide. the study revealed that ecath1 was active against all equine isolates of e. coli, s. enterica, k. pneumoniae, pseudomonas spp. and r. equi tested, with mics of 0.5-16 mug ml(-1), but was not active against most isolates of s. aureus. in conclusion, the activity of the equine antimicrobial peptide ecath1 appears to not be hampered by the antibiotic resistance of clinical isolates. thus, the data suggest that ecath1 could be useful, not only in the treatment of r. equi infections, but also of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.
study on antibacterial effect of medlar and hawthorn compound extract in vitro.
this paper evaluated the antibacterial effect of medlar and hawthorn compound extract in vitro. water extract method and ethanol extraction method was adopted to prepare the compound extracts, and disc diffusion method and improved test tube doubling dilution method were used to conduct the antibacterial test on the two common pathogenic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumonia, in vitro. the results showed that medlar and hawthorn compound extract was moderately sensitive to staphylococcus aureus, while its inhibiting effect on klebsiella pneumoniae was particularly significant, moreover, the antibacterial effect of ethanol extract was better than water extract. medlar and hawthorn compounds had good antibacterial effect on the two pathogenic bacteria.
antimicrobial activity and sar study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
a series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. they were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida krusei, and candida albicans. in this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). then, we present a sar study for staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the dominance-based rough set approach (drsa), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. the sar study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.
antibacterial effects of curcumin: an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration study.
aim: to evaluate the antibacterial effect of curcumin with the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) method in standard bacterial strains. methods: the in vitro antibacterial activity of curcumin was evaluated against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (atcc 29213), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (atcc 43300), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), bacillus subtilis (atcc 6633), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc 700603) using the macrodilution broth susceptibility test method. after incubation in tubes, the antibacterial activity of curcumin was detected by a lack of turbidity, which indicated the inhibition of bacterial growth. the concentration in the tube with the highest dilution showing no turbidity was defined as the mic. results: the curcumin mic values were 175 microg/ml, 129 microg/ml, 219 microg/ml, 217 microg/ml, 163 microg/ml, 293 microg/ml and 216 microg/ml against p. aeruginosa, b. subtilis, mssa, mrsa, e. coli, e. faecalis and k. pneumonia, respectively. conclusion: this study revealed antibacterial effects of curcumin against standard bacterial strains in high concentrations. animal experiments have demonstrated that curcumin applied at high doses has strong antibacterial activity. there is a need for further in vivo studies to shed light on antibacterial effects of curcumin with high concentrations.
risk factors for cardiovascular events in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
background: an increased risk of cardiovascular complications has been found in those with community-acquired pneumonia (cap). preliminary data suggest that pneumococcal pneumonia, more severe pneumonia, older age, renal disease, hypoalbuminemia, and inpatient sliding scale insulin administration contribute to risk. the objective of this study was to ascertain additional factors influencing cardiovascular events in cap. methods: this investigation was a retrospective cohort study of inpatients with cap. outcomes evaluated were development of a cardiovascular event during hospitalization, defined as acute pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction. those with and without events were compared across cardiovascular- and pneumonia-specific variables by logistic regression to ascertain factors that independently increase risk or reduce risk. results: of 3068 inpatients with pneumonia, 376 (12%) developed a cardiovascular event. hyperlipidemia, more severe pneumonia, and staphylococcus aureus or klebsiella pneumoniae as etiologies were associated with increased risk, while statin use was associated with decreased risk. conclusions: this study highlights variables in cap patients that should make clinicians vigilant for the development of cardiac complications. additional research is needed to determine if statins attenuate cardiac risk in cap.
antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.
new antibiotics for bad bugs: where are we?
bacterial resistance to antibiotics is growing up day by day in both community and hospital setting, with a significant impact on the mortality and morbidity rates and the financial burden that is associated. in the last two decades multi drug resistant microorganisms (both hospital- and community-acquired) challenged the scientific groups into developing new antimicrobial compounds that can provide safety in use according to the new regulation, good efficacy patterns, and low resistance profile. in this review we made an evaluation of present data regarding the new classes and the new molecules from already existing classes of antibiotics and the ongoing trends in antimicrobial development. infectious diseases society of america (idsa) supported a program, called "the '10 x 20' initiative", to develop ten new systemic antibacterial drugs within 2020. the microorganisms mainly involved in the resistance process, so called the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae) were the main targets. in the era of antimicrobial resistance the new antimicrobial agents like fifth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, beta-lactamases inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines active against gram-positive pathogens, like vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) and mrsa, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin resistant enterococcus (vre) but also against highly resistant gram-negative organisms are more than welcome. of these compounds some are already approved by official agencies, some are still in study, but the need of new antibiotics still does not cover the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. therefore the management of antimicrobial resistance should also include fostering coordinated actions by all stakeholders, creating policy guidance, support for surveillance and technical assistance.

spectrum and potency of ceftaroline against leading pathogens causing community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infections in latin america, 2010.
ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as common gram-negative organisms. in this study a total of 986 isolates collected in 2010 from patients in 15 medical centers in five latin american countries from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation program were identified as community-acquired respiratory tract or skin and soft tissue infection pathogens. ceftaroline was the most potent agent tested against s. pneumoniae with a mic90 value (0.12mug/ml) that was eight-fold lower than ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and linezolid. its spectrum of coverage (100.0% susceptible) was similar to tigecycline, linezolid, levofloxacin and vancomycin. against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, ceftaroline was the most active agent tested. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus (including mrsa) was similar to that of vancomycin and tetracycline (mic90, 1mug/ml) and linezolid (mic90, 2mug/ml). the beta-haemolytic streptococci exhibited 100.0% susceptibility to ceftaroline. ceftaroline activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. was similar to that of ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. these parenteral cephalosporin agents have potent activity against non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains, but are not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains. these results confirm the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against pathogens common in community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infection in latin america, and suggest that ceftaroline fosamil could be an important therapeutic option for these infections.
[adherence to copper and stainless steel metal coupons of common nosocomial bacterial strains].
background: copper has a bactericidal activity against a series of bacterial strains. aim: to measure resistance to bacterial adherence of copper (cu) and stainless steel (ss) metal coupons. material and methods: bacterial strains causing nosocomial infections in chile were analyzed. bacterial adherence was studied using a previously described method based on a system of metal coupons that are immersed in culture media containing the bacteria of interest at room temperature. results: adherence to cu and ss coupons was different for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii strains. for these strains, no adherence to cu coupons occurred during the 48 h observation period compared to a rapidly increasing adherence to ss coupons, with a final colony count of 1.00 e + 07 cfu/ml. for two different pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains, inhibition of adherence was not observed on cu coupons, and colony counts were similar for cu and ss using the standard inoculum (2-3 x lo7 cfu).a partial decrease in adherence was observed for cu but not for ss coupons, when a lower inoculum was used. conclusions: copper surfaces represent an interesting option to reduce bacterial contamination in the hospital environment due to its resistance to bacterial adhesion of most of the common nosocomial bacterial strains.

in an attempt to design and synthesize a new class of antimicrobials, dialkyne substituted 2-aminobenzothiazole was reacted with various substituted aryl azides to generate a small library of 20 compounds (3a-t) by click chemistry. structures of the newly synthesized compounds were established on the basis of spectral data. these compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against gram+ bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), gram- bacteria (salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella boydii) and antifungal activity against candida tropicalis, candida albicans, candida krusei, cryptococcus neoformans) as well as molds (aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus). the compound 3e showed maximum potency against all gram+/gram- bacterial strains with mic value 3.12 mug/ml, which is two fold more active as compared to standard drug ciprofloxacin (mic 6.25 mug/ml). however, all compounds were found ineffective against s. boydii (clinical isolate). further, only one compound 3n was found to be the most active against all fungal strains with mic value in the range of 1.56 mug/ml-12.5 mug/ml while the remaining compounds showed moderate to weak antifungal activity.
phytochemical screening and evaluation of monechma ciliatum (black mahlab) seed extracts as antimicrobial agents.
objective: tribes in nubia mountains regions of sudan used monechma ciliatum seeds for common cold and other chest allergic conditions as a traditional medicine. the aim of this paper is to validate this traditional practice scientifically. materials and methods: monechma ciliatum seeds were screened for major phytochemical groups using standard methods. different extracts were bioassayed in- vitro for their bioactivity to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. results: phytochemical screening results showed the presence of flavonoids, tannins, triterpens, and anthraquinones. staphylococcus aureus was found to be sensitive to both water extract with zones of inhibition 22 - 26 mm at concentrations of 50 and 100mg/ml and ethanol extract 17 mm at concentration of 100 mg/ml. the growth of klebsiella pneumoniae was inhibited by ethanol extract with zones of inhibition equal to 16, 26, and 33 mm at concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 mg/ml, respectively. pseudomonas aeruginosa was insensitive to all extracts used. similarly, all used fungi were found to be insensitive to extracts used. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the extracts against microorganisms were ranged from 12.5 to 25 mg/ml. conclusion: the findings of the current study support the traditional uses of the plant's seed in the therapy of respiratory tract infections caused by staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae.
serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of ssis.
background: despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (ssis) is still high. an improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. the aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. methods: a total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. results: after single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and non-esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. moreover, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans were also inhibited. we found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring: at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional ssis. conclusions: these preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.
spectrum and potency of ceftaroline tested against leading pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections in europe (2010).
ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel cephalosporin exhibiting bactericidal activity in vitro against gram-positive organisms, including meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), beta-haemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci (vgs) and streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as against many common gram-negative organisms. the objective of this study was to determine the spectrum and potency of ceftaroline against recent (2010) leading pathogens causing complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (csstis) isolated in europe. a total of 2438 isolates from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance and evaluation (aware) programme were identified as cssti pathogens. isolates were collected from patients in 52 medical centres in 19 european countries. reference susceptibility testing for ceftaroline and commonly used antimicrobials was performed by broth microdilution methodologies. ceftaroline was very active overall against s. aureus (mic(50/90)=0.25/1 mg/l) and inhibited 100.0% of isolates at a mic of </=2 mg/l. activity against mrsa was documented (mic(50/90)=1/2 mg/l) but was lower than that observed against mssa (mic(50/90)=0.25/0.25 mg/l). ceftaroline was also very active against 460 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 93 vgs (mic(90)=0.015 mg/l and 0.06 mg/l, respectively). ceftaroline was active against escherichia coli (mic(50)=0.12 mg/l) and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic(50)=0.06 mg/l) not expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, with activity similar to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. in summary, this study documents the potent in vitro activity of ceftaroline when tested against recent pathogens isolated from patients with cssti in europe.
copper(ii) triflate promoted multicomponent catalytic clubbing of piperazinyl-thiazoloquinolines and thiazolocoumarins as antimicrobials.
step economical, multicomponent construction of two series based on quinoline and coumarin ring systems was carried out. annulation towards the 2-piperazinylthiazole system was established in satisfactory yields, using copper(ii) triflate. these multicomponent reaction products were examined for their potential inhibitory effect against two gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus), three gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and two fungal species (aspergillus niger and candida albicans). in vitro pharmacological screening data demonstrated that the majority of the compounds were found to possess a significant broad-spectrum antimicrobial (25-50 microg/ml of mic) potential and the results were comparable to control drugs. the structural assignments of final products were done on the basis of ir, 1h nmr, 13c nmr spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. the structure-activity relationship (sar) was explored to facilitate further development of this class of compounds.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts of rumex dentatus  l.
in-vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of various concentrations ranging from 150 to 500 mug/ml of alcoholic (methanol and ethanol) extracts of rumex dentatus were analyzed on different clinical bacterial strains (shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus) and fungal strains (aspergillus versicolor, aspergillus flavus, acremonium spp., penicillium dimorphosporum, candida albicans, candida kruesie, candida parapsilosis) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (mic and mbc determination) for antimicrobial activity and dpph (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assay, riboflavin photo-oxidation assay, deoxyribose assay, lipid peroxidation assay for antioxidant activity. the extracts showed maximum inhibitory effect against k. pneumonia and p. aeruginosa with no activity against s. typhimurium from among the bacterial strains while as in case of the fungal strains the maximum effect was observed against c. albicans by both the extracts. mic and mbc values determined for active fractions of the extracts against some bacterial strains (s. flexneri, k. pneumonia and e. coli) revealed that the test organisms were inhibited by all the extracts with methanol showing lower values of both mic and mbc indicating it as a better antimicrobial agent. the antioxidant activity showed that the extracts exhibited scavenging effect in concentration-dependent manner on superoxide anion radicals and hydroxyl radicals leading to the conclusion that the plant has got a broad spectrum antimicrobial and antioxidant activity and could be a potential alternative for treating various diseases.
antimicrobial isothiocyanates from the seeds of moringa oleifera lam.
4-(alpha-l-rhamnosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate (1) and 4-(4'-o-acetyl-alpha-l-rhamnosyloxy)-benzyl isothiocyanate (2) isolated from moringa oleifera seeds were screened for their antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for their antifungal activities against candida albicans, trichophyton rubrum, and epidermophyton floccosum using the disk diffusion method. isothiocyanates 1 and 2 were found active at the lowest inhibitory concentration of 1 mg/ml against all gram-positive bacteria tested (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, b. subtilis) and against the dermatophytic fungi e. floccosum and t. rubrum. statistically significant differences were found between the mean inhibition zones (iz) of 1 and 2 and the standard drugs, ofloxacin and clotrimazole. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values confirmed the good antimicrobial activity of 1 and 2 against s. aureus, good to moderate activity against s. epidermidis, moderate activity against b. subtilis, and weak activity against e. floccosum and t. rubrum. the in vitro bactericidal effect of 1 and 2 against the gram-positive bacterial strains tested is suggested by mbc:mic ratios of 2:1.
antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude plant extracts from colombian biodiversity.
on a global scale, people have used plants to treat diseases and infections, and  this has raised interest on the plant biodiversity potencial in the search of antimicrobial principles. in this work, 75 crude n-hexanes, dichloromethane and methanol extracts from the aerial parts of 25 plants belonging to four botanical families (asteraceae, euphorbiaceae, rubiaceae and solanaceae), collected at the natural regional park ucumari (risaralda, colombia), were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities by the agar well diffusion method. the antibacterial activities were assayed against two gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, and three gram-negative ones named, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, the same plant extracts were tested against the yeast candida albicans and the fungi aspergillus fumigatus and fusarium solani. overall, the plant extracts examined displayed better bactericide rather than fungicide activities. in general, the best antibacterial activity was showed by the plant extracts from the rubiaceae family, followed in order by the extracts from the euphorbiaceae and solanaceae ones. it is important to emphasize the great activity displayed by the methanol extract of alchornea coelophylla (euphorbiaceae) that inhibited four out of five bacteria tested (b. subtilis, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and e. coli). furthermore, the best minimal inhibitory concentration for the extracts with antifungal activities were displayed by the dichloromethane extracts from acalypha diversifolia and euphorbia sp (euphorbiaceae). the most susceptible fungus evaluated was f. solani since 60% and 20% of the dichloromethane and methanol extracts evaluated inhibited the growth of this phytopathogenic fungus. the antimicrobial activity of the different plant extracts examined in this work could be related to the secondary metabolites contents and their interaction and susceptibility of pathogenic microorganism evaluated.

the current study was aimed to assess antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic activity of total saponin, alkaloid and sterol contents of joshanda decoction followed by its constituent's analysis via thin layer chromatography (tlc). saponins and alkaloids showed prominent antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus and klebsiella pneumoniae whereas sterols only against s. aureus. saponin and alkaloid contents of 97 and 108 microg/ml, respectively, showed prominent free radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhidrazyl, with mild cytotoxicity in brine shrimp cytotoxic test. under ultraviolet light at 254 nm, tlc of total saponins showed eight different compounds, total sterols comprising three while total alkaloids two compounds of various polarities. it is concluded that the various contents of joshanda decoction possess outstanding susceptibility against bacteria implicating primarily upper respiratory tract infections augmented by strong antioxidant activity.
a reflection on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents at a major tertiary  care center in lebanon over a decade.
background: antimicrobial resistance has been inflecting deleterious health and economic consequences locally and globally. this study addresses the patterns and trends of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents over a decade, at a major tertiary care center in beirut. methods: data on bacterial susceptibility patterns at the cap accredited clinical microbiology laboratory is analyzed from january 2000 to november 2011, along with related different studies conducted during this period. results: increasing rates of esbl-producing isolates were noted for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. resistance to carbapenems remains problematic in acinetobacter spp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and started emerging in e. coli and k. pneumoniae. tigecycline and colistin maintained excellent activity against most esbl and carbapenem resistant bacteria relevant to the treatment by these agents. resistance to quinolones is being encountered in streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), though remaining relatively high, showed decreasing trends of resistance, while vancomycin maintain uniform activity. rare and sporadic vancomycin resistant strains in enterococci are encountered. macrolide and clindamycin increasing rates of resistance is noted in s. pneumoniae, group a streptococci, s. aureus, viridans streptococci and some others. conclusion: physicians should be aware of the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance to properly guide the initial therapy. these resistance problems can be attributed to uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents, thus, highlighting the need for antimicrobial stewardship to curb this threat.
microwave-assisted synthesis of antimicrobial agents based on pyridazine moiety.
an efficient and simple microwave assisted synthesis of sulfonamide derivatives incorporating the pyridazine moiety has been developed. these sulfonamides were used for the preparation of new heterocyclic compounds via reaction with different reagents using a microwave irradiation technique. the structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed on the basis of ftir, (1)h and (13)c-nmr, mass spectral techniques and elemental analyses. some of the new synthesized compounds were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia and antifungal activity against aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans. most of the new compounds showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity.
novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
influence of hybrid inorganic/organic mesoporous and nanostructured materials on  the cephalosporins' efficacy on different bacterial strains.
the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different hybrid inorganic-organic micro- and nanomaterials (fe(3)o(4)/peg(600), fe(3)o(4)/c(12), zsm-5) on the antibacterial activity of different cephalosporins against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. the synergic effect of the studied materials was demonstrated by the increase in the growth inhibition zones diameter. all tested hybrid micro- and nanomaterials increased the activity of cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus. zsm-5 increased the activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone and fe(3)o(4)/c(12) that of ceftriaxone against pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus. the anti-pseudomonas, anti-klebsiella pneumoniae and anti-bacillus subtilis activity of cefoperazone was increased by fe(3)o(4)/c(12) nanoparticles, while the zsm-5 improved its anti-escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus and b. subtilis activity, whereas fe(3)o(4)/peg(600) against k. pneumoniae. the anti-k. pneumoniae activity of cefepime was increased by all tested nanoparticles, whereas its anti-b. subtilis and anti-e. coli activity was improved by fe(3)o(4)/c(12) and fe(3)o(4)/peg(600) nanoparticles. in conclusion, both magnetic fe(3)o(4) nanoparticles, charged outside as extra-shell with the antibiotic as well as zsm-5 microparticles carrying the antibiotic inside the pores, significantly and specifically improved cephalosporin efficacy. a probable explanation for the increase in the antibiotic efficiency is the better penetration through the cellular wall of the antibiotic charged nanoparticles.
estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections caused by selected multidrug-resistant bacteria finland, 2010.
background: knowledge of the burden of healthcare-associated infections (hai) and antibiotic resistance is important for resource allocation in infection control. although national surveillance networks do not routinely cover all hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, estimates are nevertheless possible: in the eu, 25,000 patients die from such infections annually. we assessed the burden of hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria in finland in 2010. methods: by combining data from the national infectious disease registry on the numbers of bacteremias caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., and susceptibility data from the national antimicrobial resistance network and the finnish hospital infection program, we assessed the numbers of healthcare-associated bacteremias due to selected multidrug-resistant bacteria. we estimated the number of pneumonias, surgical site and urinary tract infections by applying the ratio of these infections in the first national prevalence survey for hai in 2005. attributable hai mortality (3.2%) was also derived from the prevalence survey. results: the estimated annual number of the most common hais due to the selected multidrug-resistant bacteria was 2804 (530 hais per million), 6% of all hais in finnish acute care hospitals. the number of attributable deaths was 89 (18 per million). conclusions: resources for infection control should be allocated not only in screening and isolation of carriers of multidrug-resistant bacteria, even when they are causing a small proportion of all hais, but also in preventing all clinical infections.
anthelmintic and antimicrobial activity of methanolic and aqueous extracts of euphorbia helioscopia l.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the anthelmintic and antimicrobial efficacy of euphorbia helioscopia crude extracts. a worm motility inhibition assay and egg hatch assay were used for in vitro study, and a faecal egg count reduction assay was used for in vivo study. the in vitro study revealed anthelmintic effects of crude methanolic extracts of e. helioscopia on live haemonchus contortus worms as evident from their paralysis and/or death at 8 h after exposure. different concentrations (12.5 mg ml(-1), 25 mg ml(-1) and 50 mg ml(-1)) of aqueous and methanolic extracts were used against h. contortus which exhibited dose-dependent anthelmintic effects on h. contortus. different extracts of e. helioscopia on percent inhibitory egg hatching was very low as compared to levamisole. the antimicrobial activity of extracts ranging from 100 to 500 mg ml(-1) screened by disc diffusion method against four selected bacterial (staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas multocida and escherichia coli) and two fungal strains (aspergillus flavus and candida albicans) was also dose dependent with the extract showing more inhibitory effects against s. aureus and e. coli and a minimum inhibitory effect against a. flavus. it is concluded that the entire plant of e. helioscopia possesses significant anthelmintic and antimicrobial activity and could be a potential alternative for treating cases of helminth infections in ruminants.
influence of substituent effects on spectroscopic properties and antimicrobial activity of 5-(4'-substituted phenylazo)-2-thioxothiazolidinone derivatives.
5-(4'-substituted phenylazo)-2-thioxothiazolidinone derivatives (hl(n)) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, spectra (ir, electronic and (1)h nmr). the ir spectral data indicate that the compounds can exist in two resonance structures. the synthesized ligands were screened for their antimicrobial activity against four bacterial species, two gram positive bacteria (bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus) and two gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) as well as against some species various of fungi; aspergillus niger, penicillium chrysogenum, penicillium italicum and fusarium oxysporium. the results showed that most these ligands are good antibacterial agents against b. cereus and s. aureus and antifungal agents against a. niger and f. oxysporium. hl(3) was found to be the most effect compound against all tested microorganisms. the size of clear zone were ordered as follows p-(och(3) < ch(3) < h < cl < no(2)) as expected from hammett's constant sigma(r).
plant essential oils and their constituents in coping with multidrug-resistant bacteria.
antibiotic resistance is documented to be a serious problem that affects the choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy and increases the probability of unfavorable infection outcome. one of the proposed methods to cope with multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria is the use of alternative antibacterial treatments, which include natural antimicrobial substances such as plant essential oils (eos). the aim of the present article is to review published studies on the activity of eos and their constituents against mdr bacteria and to formulate perspectives for the future. in general, published studies indicate that eos can be used as effective antiseptics against many species, including mdr bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, resistant isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and others; certain eos may potentiate the effectiveness of antibiotics against mdr bacteria; eos can be synergistic with bacteriophages; and polymeric nanoparticles can be used for delivery of eos and enhancement of their activity at the site of infection.
chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of linum pubescens growing wild in jordan.
the volatile constituents of the aerial flowering parts of linum pubescens were collected by hydro-distillation and analysed by gc and gc/ms. analysis allowed the identification of 68 components of which, geranyl isovalerate (18.93%), lauric acid (12.07%), germacrene d (10.61%), decanoic acid (8.07%), 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone (5.02%) and 1-hexanol (4.99%) were detected as major constituents. the isolated essential oil of the plant exhibited high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus atcc11778, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 2923) and showed moderate antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 25922, enterococcus faecalis atcc 13048 and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 10031).
dna binding mode of novel tetradentate amino acid based 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine complexes.
few transition metal complexes of tetradentate n(2)o(2) donor schiff base ligands containing 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine and amino acids (alanine/valine) abbreviated to khl(1)/khl(2) have been synthesized. all the metal complexes have been fully characterized with the help of elemental analyses, molecular weights, molar conductance values, magnetic moments and spectroscopic data. the schiff bases khl(1)/khl(2) are found to act as tetradentate ligands using n(2)o(2) donor set of atoms leading to a square-planar geometry for the complexes around the metal ions. the binding behaviors of the complexes to calf thymus dna have been investigated by absorption spectra, viscosity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. the dna binding constants reveal that all these complexes interact with dna through minor groove binding mode. the studies on mechanism of photocleavage reveal that singlet oxygen ((1)o(2)) and superoxide anion radical (o(2)(-)) may play an important role in the photocleavage. the schiff bases and their metal complexes have been screened for their in vitro antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae and antifungal activities against aspergillus niger, fusarium solani, culvularia lunata, rhizoctonia bataicola and candida albicans by mic method.
hydroxyapatites and europium(iii) doped hydroxyapatites as a carrier of silver nanoparticles and their antimicrobial activity.
hydroxyapatites (ca10(po4)6(oh)2 and eu3+:ca10(po4)6(oh)2) were synthesized by aqueous synthesis route. hydroxyapatites were impregnated with silver ions that were subsequently reduced. xrd, tem, and saed measurements were used in order to determine the crystal structure and morphology of the final products. the results showed the well crystallized hydroxyapatite grains with diameter of about 35 nm and with silver nanoparticles on their surface. the antimicrobial activity of the nanoparticles against: staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538 as model of the gram-positive bacteria, escherichia coli atcc 11229, and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352 as model of gram-negative bacteria, were shown with the best activity against k. pneumoniae. these nanocomposite powders can be a promising antimicrobial agent and a fluorescent material for biodetection due to their optical and bioactive properties.
bio-efficacy of dioscorea pentaphylla from midmid-western ghats, india.
antibacterial and antifungal activity of crude extracts of medicinally important  and traditionally used yam plant, dioscorea pentaphylla, from mid-western ghats was evaluated against 27 bacterial and 5 fungal clinical strains collected of the patients from infectious sources. the clinical strains belonging to their respective species showed concentration-dependent susceptibility toward crude petroleum ether extract, chloroform extract and methanol extract at 100 mug/100 mul. the extracts exhibited predominant antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus (atcc-20852), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc-29737) and klebsiella pneumoniae (mtcc-618), respectively, and five clinically isolated pathogenic fungi, trichophyton rubrum, microsporum gypseum, tricophyton tonsurans, microsporum audouini, and candida albicans, with antibacterial drug ciprofloxacin and antifungal drug fluconozole (50 mug/100 mul) as standards. out of the three extracts, ethanol extracts possessed better minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against all the bacterial strains. all the three extracts showed significant activity against all the five fungal pathogen strains. the results are promising and support the traditional use of d. pentaphylla for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
structures of staphylococcus aureus peptide deformylase in complex with two classes of new inhibitors.
peptide deformylase (pdf) catalyzes the removal of the formyl group from the n-terminal methionine residue in newly synthesized polypeptides, which is an essential process in bacteria. four new inhibitors of pdf that belong to two different classes, hydroxamate/pseudopeptide compounds [pmt387 (7a) and pmt497] and reverse-hydroxamate/nonpeptide compounds [pmt1039 (15e) and pmt1067], have been developed. these compounds inhibited the growth of several pathogens involved in respiratory-tract infections, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae, and leading nosocomial pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) in the range 0.1-0.8 mg ml(-1). interestingly, the reverse-hydroxamate/nonpeptide compounds showed a 250-fold higher antimicrobial activity towards s. aureus, although the four compounds showed similar k(i) values against s. aureus pdf enzymes, with k(i) values in the 11-85 nm range. to provide a structural basis for the discovery of additional pdf inhibitors, the crystal structures of s. aureus pdf in complex with the four inhibitors were determined at resolutions of 1.90-2.30 a. the inhibitor-bound structures displayed distinct deviations depending on the inhibitor class. the distance between the zn(2+) ion and the carbonyl o atom of the hydroxamate inhibitors (or the hydroxyl o atom of the reverse-hydroxamate inhibitors) appears to be correlated to s. aureus inhibition activity. the structural information reported in this study should aid in the discovery of new pdf inhibitors that can be used as novel antibacterial drugs.
chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods: the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si = 3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
antimicrobial activities of aerva javanica and paeonia emodi plants.
aerva javanica and paeonia emodi plants extracts were studied for antibacterial activity against escherichia coli (nctc 10418), klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc 700603), pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus epidermidis (nctc 11047) and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (nctc 13143) and antifungal activity against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani. extracts were obtained by using methanol, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous fraction. the extracts of paeonia emodi and aerva javanica showed significant antibacterial activity but only salmonella typhi was resistant to aerva javanica. moreover, the antifungal activity of aerva javanica was very poor but the fractions of paeonia emodi showed sufficient inhibition against fungal strains.
antibacterial activity of extracts from five medicinal plants and their formula against bacteria that cause chronic wound infection.
background: chronic wound is caused by various factors such as chemotherapy, gene damage, treatment with steroids, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, blood pressure, infection and nutritional factors. one of the most common causes is bacterial infection. antibacterial activity of several herbal plants has been reported. thai medicinal plants which possess biological activities are potential to develop an alternative treatment of bacterial infection. objective: to study efficiency of extracts from medicinal plants and their formula against bacteria that cause chronic wound infection. material and method: extraction of thai medicinal plants including curcuma longa linn, rhinacanthus nasutus linn, garcinia mangostana linn, caesalpinia sappan linn and centellia asiatica linn was performed by maceration with 95% ethanol and decoction followed by freeze dry. formulation was conducted by varying the ratio of each components. antibacterial activity were determined disk diffusion and broth dilution against staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. results: ethanolic extracts exhibited better antibacterial activity against tested strains than water extracts. antibacterial activity of caesalpinia sappan linn. against s. aureus and mrsa showed the most effective with mic value of 0.625 mg/ml. one of the five different formulas which contained two times proportion of c. sappan revealed that this formula was able to inhibit all tested strains with the mic ranging between 0.156 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml. conclusion: c. sappan is the most effective herbal plant. the formula with two times proportion of c. sappan is potentially best formula for development of medicinal product of chronic wound infection. the potential active compound of c. sappan is suggested for further investigation of antimicrobial activity and other biological properties.
relationship between lactobacilli and opportunistic bacterial pathogens associated with vaginitis.
background: vaginitis, is an infectious inflammation of the vaginal mucosa, which sometimes involves the vulva. the balance of the vaginal flora is maintained by the lactobacilli and its protective and probiotic role in treating and preventing vaginal infection by producing antagonizing compounds which are regarded as safe for humans. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the protective role of lactobacilli against common bacterial opportunistic pathogens in vaginitis and study the effects of some antibiotics on lactobacilli isolates. materials and methods: in this study (110) vaginal swabs were obtained from women suffering from vaginitis who admitted to babylon hospital of maternity and paediatrics in babylon province, iraq. the study involved the role of intrauterine device among married women with vaginitis and also involved isolation of opportunistic bacterial isolates among pregnant and non pregnant women. this study also involved studying probiotic role of lactobacilli by production of some defense factors like hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocin, and lactic acid. results: results revealed that a total of 130 bacterial isolates were obtained. intrauterine device was a predisposing factor for vaginitis. the most common opportunistic bacterial isolates were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. all lactobacilli were hydrogen peroxide producers while some isolates were bacteriocin producers that inhibited some of opportunistic pathogens (s. aureus, e. coli). lactobacilli were sensitive to erythromycin while 93.3% of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin and (40%, 53.3%) of them were resistant to amoxicillin and gentamycin respectively. results revealed that there was an inverse relationship between lactobacilli presence and organisms causing vaginitis. this may be attributed to the production of defense factors by lactobacilli. conclusion: the types of antibiotics used to treat vaginitis must be very selective in order not to kill the beneficial bacteria (lactobacilli) that help in preservation of vaginal health and ecosystem as being one of the probiotic bacteria.
profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of andhra pradesh, india.
introduction: antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. methods: data on antibiotic usage and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in vijayawada, andhra pradesh, india, through the use of questionnaires. the data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. results: the consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. these drugs were found to be in high demand. among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the following organism profile: escherichia coli (36%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16%), staphylococcus aureus (29%), enterococcus faecalis (9%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). in terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. conclusion: the results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.
prevalence, bacterial causes, and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of mastitis isolates from cows in large-scale dairy farms of northern ethiopia.
the study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of bovine mastitis, isolate  mastitis causing bacteria, assess the association of some risk factors, and determine the antibiotic resistance pattern of bacterial isolates in cows in large-scale dairy farms of northern ethiopia. a total of 305 lactating and nonlactating cows were included in the present study. the overall prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis was 3.6 and 33.8 %, respectively. the quarter level prevalence was 15.4 %; from which, 11.9 and 1.1 % were subclinical form and blind teat, respectively, while the remaining 2.4 % were of clinical form. staphylococcus aureus accounted for 36 % of the isolates followed by escherichia coli (27.3 %). risk factors including age (p < 0.001), parity (p < 0.001), and lactation stage (p = 0.02) showed significant association with the occurrence of mastitis. higher prevalence was observed in both groups of older cows (i.e., 6-9 years (odds ratio (or) = 4.65, 95 % confidence interval (ci) = 2.74-7.89) and >9 years (or = 3.63, 95 % ci = 1.42-9.25)), cows with four to seven calves (or = 3.39, 95 % ci = 2.06-5.60), and cows in late lactation stage (or = 3.79, 95 % ci = 1.64-8.75). in multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (p = 0.005) and lactation stage (p = 0.027) showed statistically significant association with the occurrence of mastitis. the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern showed high susceptibility of s. aureus to nalidixic acid (82.4 %) followed by chloramphenicol (58.8 %); however, these species were resistant to the rest of the antimicrobials tested. highest resistance was observed against clindamycin and ampicillin. coliform bacteria (e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) showed resistance to most of the antimicrobials used. detailed investigation is needed to identify the interplay of managemental and environmental risk factors to design appropriate control measures.
[microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
aim: development of methodical approach of evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis. materials and methods: 9 bifidobacteria cultures (dominants) and 18 opportunistic microorganism strains (associants) isolated from patients during examination for intestine dysbiosis and identified by conventional methods were used. evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis was performed by author developed technique that is based on determination of growth factors (gf), anti-lysozyme activity (ala) and formation of biofilms (bff) of associants co-incubated with exometabolites of dominants. gf, ala, bff were studied photometrically (bukharin o.v., 1999, 2009; o'toole g.a., 2000). the data were statistically analyzed by fisher-student criteria. results: the detected opposite (increase/reduction) phenomenon of the "dominant-associant" pair allowed realization of the "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis. associants (e. coli and enterococcus faecium) were "friend" species, in which bifidobacteria exometabolites did not change growth properties and stimulated ala (by 17,5--32%) and bff (by 25 - 39%). associants (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans) were "foe" microsymbiont species, in which bifidoflora exometabolites decreased gf (by 20,7--68%), ala (by 22,7--54%) and bff (by 22,5 --39%). conclusion: indigenous microflora during microsymbiocenosis formation can participate in "friend-foe" identification, the basis of which is determined by microsymbiont exometabolites. the data obtained open a perspective of understanding mechanisms of intramicrobial interactions and can be used for both diagnostics and optimal selection of "candidates" during creation of new probiotics and synbiotics.

objectives: this short study aims to determine the prevalence of various bacterial pathogens causing infections in the aseer regions, and to also assess the distribution of staphylococcus aureus in relation to different body sites as well as their in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility profile. methods: clinical specimens (n=9831) from various infections diagnosed at aseer central hospital (ach) and abha general hospital (agh), were analyzed bacteriologically. confirmed s. aureus isolates (n=210) were tested against 44 antibacterial agents as per standard methods. results: bacterial pathogens were recovered from 24.9% of the samples. the results revealed that escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and s. aureus to be the main etiological agents, while purulent exudates of wounds and abscesses were the main source of s. aureus. out of the 210 s. aureus isolates; 77 (38.5%) were recovered from purulent exudates of wounds and abscesses of the examined patients and 53 (26.5%) were from high vaginal discharges, while other body sites exhibited different rates of s. aureus. on the other hand, 45% of the 210 s. aureus isolates were found to be multidrug resistant s. aureus (mrsa). conclusion: the results from this study revealed that escherichia coli and staphylococci were the main etiological agents, while purulent exudates of wounds and abscesses were the main source of s. aureus. also, a higher rate of mrsa was detected.
the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
effect of a synbiotic on microbial community structure in a continuous culture model of the gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
patients with dysphagia require long-term nutritional support. this can be delivered by the enteral route via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg) tube. enteral nutrition (en) bypasses the body's innate defences that prevent the microbial colonization of the proximal gut, which predisposes to microbial overgrowth. a continuous culture model simulating the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota of en patients was used to investigate the effects of a synbiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus dun-311, bifidobacterium bifidum bb-02, bifidobacterium lactis bl-01, synergy 1) on microbial community structure and metabolism. a peg tube was inserted into the fermenters to study biofilm formation. the synbiotic delivered in sterile semi-skimmed milk (sssm) was introduced either 48 h prior to or after peg tube insertion. the synbiotic reduced biofilm formation on peg tube surfaces, with suppression of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae when it was added subsequent to peg insertion. when synbiotic feeding was commenced prior to peg insertion, colonization by staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and candida famata was also inhibited. lactate production increased in response the synbiotic or control (sssm). these results indicate that the use of a synbiotic has the potential to reduce pathogen colonization on peg tube surfaces in vivo, thereby reducing the incidence of biofilm-related infectious complications.

biological activity of carbazole alkaloids and essential oil of murraya koenigii  against antibiotic resistant microbes and cancer cell lines.
a total of three carbazole alkaloids and essential oil from the leaves of murraya koenigii (rutaceae) were obtained and examined for their effects on the growth of five antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria and three tumor cell lines (mcf-7, p 388 and hela). the structures of these carbazoles were elucidated based on spectroscopy data and compared with literature data, hence, were identified as mahanine (1), mahanimbicine (2) and mahanimbine (3). the chemical constituents of the essential oil were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (gcms). these compounds exhibited potent inhibition against antibiotic resistant bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (210p jtu), psedomonas aeruginosa (atcc 25619), klebsiella pneumonia (sr1-tu), escherchia coli (ni23 jtu) and streptococcus pneumoniae (sr16677-prsp) with significant minimum inhibition concentration (mic) values (25.0-175.0 mg/ml) and minimum bacteriacidal concentrations (mbc) (100.0-500.0 mg/ml). the isolated compounds showed significant antitumor activity against mcf-7, hela and p388 cell lines. mahanimbine (3) and essential oil in particular showed potent antibacteria and cytotoxic effect with dose dependent trends (</=5.0 mug/ml). the findings from this investigation are the first report of carbazole alkaloids' potential against antibiotic resistant clinical bacteria, mcf-7 and p388 cell lines.
evaluation of ceftobiprole activity against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, including escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and beta-lactamase negative), and klebsiella pneumoniae, in a rabbit meningitis model.
ceftobiprole medocaril, a new cephalosporin, is highly active against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. in this study, we tested ceftobiprole against various gram-negative pathogens in a rabbit meningitis model and determined its penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (csf). in this animal model, ceftobiprole produced an antibacterial activity similar to that of cefepime against an escherichia coli strain, a klebsiella pneumoniae strain, and a beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae strain. against a beta-lactamase-positive h. influenzae strain, ceftobiprole was significantly superior. the penetration of ceftobiprole through inflamed meninges reached about 16% of serum levels compared to about 2% of serum levels through uninflamed meninges.
dna, protein binding, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and antibacterial activities  of new palladium(ii) complexes of thiosemicarbazone ligands: effects of substitution on biological activity.
the coordination propensities of 4(n,n')-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde-4(n)-substituted thiosemicarbazones (h(2)l(1-4)) were investigated by reacting with an equimolar amount of [pdcl(2)(pph(3))(2)]. the new complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. the structure determination of the complexes [pd(deasal-tsc)(pph(3))] (1), [pd(deasal-mtsc)(pph(3))] (2) and [pd(deasal-etsc)(pph(3))] (3) by x-ray crystallography showed that ligands are coordinated in a dibasic tridentate ons donor fashion forming stable five and six membered chelate rings. the binding ability of complexes (1-4) to calf-thymus dna (ct dna) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. based on the observations, an electrostatic and an intercalative binding mode have been proposed. the protein binding studies have been monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using lysozyme as a model protein. as determined by mtt assays, complex 3 exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect towards human lung cancer cell line (a549) and liver cancer cells (hepg2). ldh, no assay and cellular uptake of the complexes have been studied. further, antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against the pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, mic50 values of the complexes showed that the complexes exhibited significant activity against the pathogens and among the complexes, 3 exhibited higher activity.
recent trends in antibiotic resistance in european icus.
purpose of review: antimicrobial resistance is an emerging problem in icus worldwide. as numbers of published results from national/international surveillance studies rise rapidly, the amount of new information may be overwhelming. therefore, we reviewed recent trends in antibiotic resistance in icus across europe in the past 18 months. recent findings: in this period, infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus appeared to stabilize (and even decrease) in some countries, and infection rates due to gram-positive bacteria resistant to vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin have remained low. in contrast, we are witnessing a continent-wide emergence of infections caused by multiresistant gram-negative bacteria, especially escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, with easily exchangeable resistance genes located on plasmids, producing enzymes such as extended spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenamases. in the absence of new antibiotics, prevention of infections, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use, optimizing adherence to universal hygienic and infection control measures, and improving implementation of diagnostic tests are our only tools to combat this threat. summary: as the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance in icus is rapidly changing toward more frequently occurring epidemics and endemicity of multi and panresistant gram-negative pathogens, better infection control and improved diagnostics will become even more important than before.
the revival of fosfomycin.
fosfomycin, originally named phosphonomycin, was discovered in spain in 1969. there are three forms of fosfomycin: fosfomycin tromethamine (a soluble salt) and fosfomycin calcium for oral use, and fosfomycin disodium for intravenous use. fosfomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting the initial step involving phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase. it has a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it is highly active against gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus, and against gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae. its unique mechanism of action may provide a synergistic effect to other classes of antibiotics including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. oral fosfomycin is mainly used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, particularly those caused by escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. intravenous fosfomycin has been administered in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. fosfomycin has good distribution into tissues, achieving clinically relevant concentrations in serum, kidneys, bladder wall, prostate, lungs, inflamed tissues, bone, cerebrospinal fluid, abscess fluid, and heart valves. fosfomycin is well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. further randomized controlled trials are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous fosfomycin for the management of nosocomial infections due to mdr pathogens.
inhibition of growth of highly resistant bacterial and fungal pathogens by a natural product.
the continuous escalation of resistant bacteria against a wide range of antibiotics necessitates discovering novel unconventional sources of antibiotics. b. oleracea l (red cabbage) is health-promoting food with proven anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. however, it has not been researched adequately for its antimicrobial activity on potential resistant pathogens. the methanol crude extract of b. oleracea l. was investigated for a possible anti-microbial activity. the screening method was conducted using disc diffusion assay against 22 pathogenic bacteria and fungi. it was followed by evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). moreover, the antibacterial and the antifungal activities were confirmed using the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (mfc), respectively. remarkable, antibacterial activity was evident particularly against highly infectious microorganisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium as well as against human fungal pathogens, trichophyton rubrum and aspergillus terreus. red cabbage is a rich source of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins being the most abundant class, which might explain its potent antimicrobial action. this extract is potentially novel for future antimicrobials, inexpensive, and readily available at a large scale for pharmaceutical companies for further investigation and processing.
synthesis, antioxidant and antimicrobial evaluation of simple aromatic esters of  ferulic acid.
aromatic ester derivatives of ferulic acid where the phenolic hydroxyl is free (6a-d) or acetylated (5a-d) were evaluated for their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. the superoxide radical scavenging capacity of compounds 5d and 6d-e (ic(50) of 0.19, 0.27 and 0.20 mm, respectively) was found to be twice as active as alpha-tocopherol (ic(50) = 0.51 mm). dpph radical scavenging capacity was moderate and only found in compounds bearing free phenolic hydroxyl groups (6a-e). with regard to antimicrobial properties, compounds 6b and 6c displayed significant activity against enterococcus faecalis (mics = 16 mug/ml) and vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis (mic for 6b, 32 and for 6c, 16 mug/ml). compound 6c also demonstrated prominent activity against planktonic staphylococcus aureus with a mic value of <8 mug/ml and it inhibited bacterial biofilm formation by s. aureus with a mbec value of <8 mug/ml, which was 64 and 128 times more potent than ofloxacin and vancomycin, respectively.
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in asia: report from the community-acquired respiratory tract infection pathogen surveillance (cartips) study, 2009-2010.
a multicentre resistance surveillance study [community-acquired respiratory tract infection pathogen surveillance (cartips)] investigating the susceptibilities of 2963 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and streptococcus spp. from asia against 12 antimicrobial agents was undertaken from 2009 to 2010. based on the breakpoints for oral penicillin v recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute, the prevalence of penicillin-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae (pnssp) ranged from 46% to 100%. azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibited variable resistance rates of 0-88% against s. pneumoniae, 0-57% against mssa and 0-76.5% against streptococcus spp. isolates. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae varied from 5.1% to 58.5%. beta-lactamase production rates amongst h. influenzae isolates ranged from 15% to 46.6% and amongst m. catarrhalis isolates from 90% to 100%. amongst m. catarrhalis isolates, macrolide resistance and cefaclor resistance rates of 5.8% and 1.2%, respectively, were found, mainly in mainland china. levofloxacin resistance rates of 0-3.9% with a mic(90) (minimum inhibitory concentration causing inhibition of 90% of isolates) of 1-2mg/l and moxifloxacin resistance rates of 0-1.7% with a mic(90) of 0.125-0.5mg/l were found amongst pnssp isolates. moxifloxacin was very active against streptococcus spp., h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis isolates, with mic(90) values of 0.125-0.25, 0.032-0.5 and 0.064-0.125mg/l, respectively. these results from the cartips study have confirmed some significant regional differences in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of s. pneumoniae, mssa, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and streptococcus spp. and emphasise the importance of antimicrobial surveillance programmes for guiding empirical therapy and for focusing interventional control of antimicrobial resistance in distinct geographic areas.

background: with the increasing experience of tigecycline usage, its ecological impact on microorganisms raises concerns but remains unknown. we aimed to analyze the difference in microorganisms isolated before, during, and after tigecycline usage and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. methods: between july 2008 and august 2009, 66 patients who received tigecycline monotherapy for more than 2 days at a taiwan medical center were enrolled. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method with vitek-2 system and was analyzed according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines, except for tigecycline. we followed usa food and drug administration criteria for interpretation of susceptibility to tigecycline. results: the median duration of tigecycline monotherapy was 13.4 days. after tigecycline treatment, the isolation frequency of acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased, but that of pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia did not change. a baumannii and p aeruginosa were the two most common pathogens when tigecycline was administered. the tigecycline susceptibility rate of a baumannii isolates decreased after the administration of tigecycline. conclusion: the most common pathogens isolated in patients receiving tigecycline were a baumannii and p aeruginosa. tigecycline usage decreased the isolation frequency of a baumannii, methicillin-resistant s aureus, e coli, and k pneumoniae. exposure to tigecycline may be associated with a decreased susceptibility rate of a baumannii for tigecycline.
design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of beta-lactam antibiotic-based imidazolium- and pyridinium-type ionic liquids.
we herein report the preparation and investigation of antibacterial activity of biocidal ionic liquids (ils) consisting of cationic imidazolium or pyridinium and an anionic beta-lactam antibiotic. the antibacterial properties were quantified by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration against escherichia coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecium. in general, the ils had improved antibacterial activity than their parent materials, whether individually or in combination. in 83% of the experiments, the ampicillin ils (amp-ils) had better antibacterial activities than their quaternary halide parent materials, whereas in 92% of the experiments, amp-ils outperformed the commercially available sodium ampicillin salt. amp-ils had up to 43 times improved antibacterial activity than sodium ampicillin. overall, when normalized for ampicillin content, ils had greater antimicrobial activity against e. coli o157:h7, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and e. faecium than sodium ampicillin alone.
antimicrobial properties and phenolic contents of medicinal plants used by the venda people for conditions related to venereal diseases.
ethnopharmacology relevance: many people are infected by venereal diseases and the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) in rural areas. sexual transmitted diseases are considered a disgrace in the community because of the stigmas attached to them. indigenous people tend to use several medicinal plants to treat these infectious diseases rather than western medicines. aim of the study: this study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial, antifungal, antigonococcal, hiv-type 1 reverse transcriptase (rt) and to determine phenolic content of twelve medicinal plants used by the venda people to treat venereal diseases. materials and methods: the dried plant materials of twelve medicinal plants were extracted with petroleum ether (pe), dichloromethane (dcm), 80% ethanol (etoh) and water. the extracts were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties against two gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative (neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria and a fungus candida albicans. the phenolic contents including total phenolics, flavonoids, gallotannins and condensed tannins of the methanolic extracts of the same plants were also determined. results: dcm and etoh extracts of bolusanthus speciosus bark and stems exhibited good activity (<0.1mg/ml) against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus with mic values ranging from 0.098 to 0.012 mg/ml. the dcm extracts of bolusanthus speciosus bark showed the best activity against candida albicans with mic and mfc values of 0.012 mg/ml. water and 50% methanol extracts of acacia karroo bark, bolusanthus speciosus stems and ximenia caffra roots and leaves showed good rt inhibition percentages (>70%) at 1mg/ml. all tested extracts exhibited dose dependent ic(50) values ranging from (0.1 to 0.6 mg/ml). almost all plant species investigated contained phenolic compounds, which were greater than 5mg/g with the exception of adansonia digitata bark and aloe chabaudii roots. the highest level of flavonoids (11.9 mug/g) were detected in ximenia caffra leaves. whereas the highest amount of gallotannins were detected in ekebergia capensis bark (69 mug/g). condensed tannins were higher in ekebergia capensis bark and ximenia caffra roots (0.47 and 0.48% respectively). adansonia digitata bark and aloe chabaudii roots exhibited low levels of phenolic compounds as well as antimicrobial activities. conclusion: the presented results offer supporting evidence for effective use of selected plant extracts. more in vitro confirmatory tests using other assays and/or in vivo tests are required. toxicity studies are urgently needed to support the safe usage of these plants.

synthesis of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole derivatives as potential anti-microbial and  cytotoxic agents.
a series of novel 2-(1h-benzimidazol-2-ylsulfanyl)-n-(4-oxo-2-phenyl-thiazolidin-3yl)-acetamide 5a-j have been synthesized from various aldehydes and 2-(5-phenyl-[1,3,4]-oxadiazol-2-ylmethylsulfanyl)-1h-benzimidazole 6a-j from various benzoic acids. these compounds were screened for their in-vitro anti-bacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis as gram positive, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli as gram negative bacterial strains and for in-vitro anti-fungal activity against asperigillus fumigatus and candida albicans. the in vitro cytotoxic properties were studied using brine shrimp bioassay. results revealed that, compounds 5b, 5d, 5g, 5i, 6b, 6e, 6f, and 6i showed excellent activity against a panel of microorganisms. the cytotoxic activities of 5b, 5g, 5i, 6b, 6f, 6h, and 6i were found to be good. all the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, ir, (1)h-nmr, (13)c-nmr and ms.
antibacterial action of a heat-stable form of l-amino acid oxidase isolated from  king cobra (ophiophagus hannah) venom.
the major l-amino acid oxidase (laao, ec 1.4.3.2) of king cobra (ophiophagus hannah) venom is known to be an unusual form of snake venom laao as it possesses unique structural features and unusual thermal stability. the antibacterial effects of king cobra venom laao were tested against several strains of clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli using broth microdilution assay. for comparison, the antibacterial effects of several antibiotics (cefotaxime, kanamycin, tetracycline, vancomycin and penicillin) were also examined using the same conditions. king cobra venom laao was very effective in inhibiting the two gram-positive bacteria (s. aureus and s. epidermidis) tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.78mug/ml (0.006mum) and 1.56mug/ml (0.012mum) against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, respectively. the mics are comparable to the mics of the antibiotics tested, on a weight basis. however, the laao was only moderately effective against three gram-negative bacteria tested (p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and e. coli), with mic ranges from 25 to 50mug/ml (0.2-0.4mum). catalase at the concentration of 1mg/ml abolished the antibacterial effect of laao, indicating that the antibacterial effect of the enzyme involves generation of hydrogen peroxide. binding studies indicated that king cobra venom laao binds strongly to the gram-positive s. aureus and s. epidermidis, but less strongly to the gram-negative e. coli and p. aeruginosa, indicating that specific binding to bacteria is important for the potent antibacterial activity of the enzyme.
[antimicrobial potential of metarhizium taii in vitro].
objective: to investigate the antimicrobial potential of metarhizium tail and its corresponding active fractions. methods: the agar diffusion method and growth-rate assay were employed individually to measure the antibacterial and antifungal activities of m. taii. the microdilution and disk colony count was used to test the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bacterial concentration. results: the extraction fractions of m. tail could evidently inhibi the growth of gram positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, gram negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aerzginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis,and phytopathogenic fungi such as rhizoctonia solani, fusarium oxysporum, hereby m. taii had a broad spectrum antimicrobial effect including potent antibacterial and antifungal activities. the antimicrobial active ingredients of m. tail mainly existed in three extraction fractions including ethyl acetate extract in fermented broth, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts in mycelia. however there was an evident discrepancy on the antibacterial spectrum and competence for different active extraction fractions. conclusion: m. taii possess potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial potential, and it is a good edible and medicinal resource for the functional food development and the discovery of new antimicrobial drug.
evaluation of tigecycline activity in clinical isolates among indian medical centers.
background: resistance to multiple antibiotics among gram-positive cocci (gpc) and gram negative bacilli (gnb) is high in india. tigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic is a newer treatment option for emerging single or multidrug-resistant (mdr) gpc and gnb. material and method: we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline and compared it against other antimicrobials. between 2005-2007, seven indian medical centers from diverse geographic regions forwarded 727 isolates [escherichia coli (166), staphylococcus aureus (125), klebsiella spp (120), streptococcus pneumoniae (102), enterococcus spp. (100), pseudomonas aeruginosa (50), acinetobacter spp. (50) and enterobacter spp. (14)] from patients with blood stream (bsi), skin and soft tissue (ssti) including surgical site, urinary tract and respiratory infections to our reference laboratory. susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials besides tigecycline included: vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, quinopristin-dalfopristin, daptomycin, amikacin, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam was determined by agar dilution and etest method. result: tigecycline was active against all gpc (mic 90 < 0.25 mug/ml), e. coli and klebsiella spp. (mic 90 </=1 mug/ml). mdr acinetobacter spp. showed lower susceptibility (70.6%) to tigecycline. tigecycline mic 90 values were not influenced by oxacillin resistance among s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, vancomycin resistance in enterococci (vre) and esbl producing e. coli, klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. increased resistance was seen to other antimicrobials among esbl producing e. coli, klebsiella spp., metallo beta lactamase (mbl) producing p. aeruginosa and vre. conclusion: tigecycline is an alternative option for emerging multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens exhibiting promising spectrum/potency exceeding currently available agents seen in india.
[susceptibility surveillance of clinical isolates to fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents from 2003 to 2008: post-marketing study of prulifloxacin].
yearly changes in the susceptibility of clinical isolates to ulifloxacin (ufx) and other fluoroquinolones were examined through surveys over 3 periods. in the first survey, 534 strains derived from 19 species were collected from clinical specimens during 6 months from december 2003 to may 2004. in the same way, 805 strains were collected from december 2005 to may 2006 in the second survey, and 863 strains were from december 2007 to may 2008 in the third survey. over these 3 study periods, the susceptibilities of fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were decreased. the isolation frequency of levofloxacin-nonsusceptible strain was increased from 0% to 11.8% and from 14.6% to 20.8%, respectively. mic90s of ufx against these pathogens were also increased, but its mic90 for e. coli was 2 to 4 times lower than that of levofloxacin. on the other hand, the susceptibility of strains of klebsiella pneumoniae to ufx was increased. among the fluoroquinolones tested, ufx showed the most potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and no changes in the mic90s occurred during the surveillance. although one strain of streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in the third study period showed levofloxacin-resistance (mic, 8 microg/ml), there were nearly no changes in the mic90s of any agents tested including ufx against s. pneumoniae during the surveillance. as for other bacterial species, a tendency to increase in resistance to ufx was not observed. the activity of ufx against salmonella spp. and shigella spp. was superior/equal to those of fluoroquinolones tested.
progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.
light insensitive silver(i) cyanoximates as antimicrobial agents for indwelling medical devices.
ten silver(i) cyanoximates of agl composition (l = nc-c(no)-r, where r is electron withdrawing groups: -cn, -c(o)nr(2), -c(o)r' (alkyl), -c(o)oet, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and x-ray analysis. crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2d) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. in these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. all studied agl complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees c. synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and uv-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and ag(i) centers. all 10 silver(i) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject of their antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus hirae, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of agl in dmf. results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. a combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(i) cyanoximates for medical applications. these include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by uv-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.
synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of fluoroquinolone derivatives containing 3-(n'-alkoxycarbamimidoyl)-4-(alkoxyimino) pyrrolidines.
a series of novel 7-[3-(n'-alkoxycarbamimidoyl)-4-(alkoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl] fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and characterized by (1)h nmr, ms and hrms. these fluoroquinolones were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity. most of them exhibit good potency in inhibiting the growth of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis (mic: 0.06-4.00 mug/ml). the activity of compounds 33 and 43 against s. aureus including mrsa and s. epidermidis including mrse (mic: 0.06-0.125 mug/ml) is more than or comparable to the reference drugs levofloxacin and gemifloxacin. in addition, compound 33 is 32 and 16-32 fold more potent than both the reference drugs against enterococcus faecium 08-7 and klebsiella pneumoniae 09-22, respectively.
in vitro antibacterial evaluation of anabaena sp. against several clinically significant microflora and hptlc analysis of its active crude extracts.
the present study was conducted to evaluate the possible antibacterial activity of anabaena extracts. anabaena was isolated from a natural source and cultured in vitro. after suitable growth, cyanobacterial culture was harvested using different solvents. extracts, thus prepared, were evaluated for their antibacterial potential by agar-well diffusion assay against bacterial species of clinical significance. mic values were determined further to check the concentration ranges for significant inhibition. hptlc analysis was done to separate the components of active crude extract in an attempt to identify the bio-active chemical entity. methanol extract exhibited more potent activity than that of hexane and ethyl acetate extracts. no inhibitory effect was found against pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, and klebsiella pneumoniae. staphylococcus aureus required about 256 microg/ml of the crude methanol extract for effective inhibition. hptlc evaluation at lambda 254 nm was performed for the separation of a complex mixture of the methanol extract. the results provide evidence that anabaena sp. extracts might indeed be potential sources of new antibacterial agents.
[synthesis, modifications, and antimicrobial activity of the methylpiperazinyl amides of triterpenic acids].
n-methylpiperazinyl amides of betulinic, platanic, glycyrrhetic, oleanolic, ursolic, and moronic acids were synthesized and modified. betulin and betulonic acid showed antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus at a concentration of 90 mg/ml, and betulin manifested a bacteriostatic effect against klebsiella pneumoniae at a concentration of 60 mg/ml. among the studied n-methylpiperazinyl amides, the highest activity against s. aureus was observed for a betulonic acid derivative.
a study of cytotoxicity of novel chlorokojic acid derivatives with their antimicrobial and antiviral activities.
a series of 6-chloromethyl-3-hydroxy-2-substituted 4h-pyran-4-one derivatives were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial and antiviral activities. mannich base derivatives were prepared through the reaction of substituted piperazine or piperidine derivatives on chlorokojic acid and formaline. the structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by ir, (1)h and (13)c nmr, esi-ms, and elemental analysis. according to the activity studies, compounds 2-7 (mic: 1-2 microg/ml) were found to be highly active against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, while compounds 3, 5 and 6 showed significant activity against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii. also, compounds 2-7 were more remarkably active against candida albicans and candida parapsilosis (mic: 4-8 microg/ml). additionally, compound 2 was the most active one against rna virus pi-3.
antimicrobial susceptibility testing of newer quinolones against gram positive and gram negative clinical isolates.
antibiotic resistance development is an ongoing process associated with irrational antibiotic use. who recommends regular surveillance programs for monitoring of antibiotic resistance. the present study is a step in this direction. a total of 124 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from different hospitals in karachi. in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility studies were carried out by agar dilution method using newer quinolones that included gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. it was observed that 50% (n=30) isolates of staphylococcus aureus were resistant to gatifloxacin. gatifloxacin was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=23) and showing complete susceptibility with mic 1mg/l except for three very resistant strains that shown resistance at even higher concentrations. escherichia coli (n=45) has shown 15.5% and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=26) 34.61% resistance to gatifloxacin. levofloxacin was more active against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli showing complete susceptibility at 0.5 mg /l concentration. pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae were found to be resistant to levofloxacin showing 36.36% and 23.08% resistance respectively. the study strongly recommends the adherence to the antibiotic policy and regular susceptibility testing to overcome the problem associated with antimicrobial resistance.
the cyclotide cycloviolacin o2 from viola odorata has potent bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria.
objectives: to determine the antibacterial activity of small cyclic plant proteins, i.e. cyclotides, and the importance of the surface exposed charged residues for activity. methods: prototypic cyclotides, including the mobius kalata b1 and the bracelet cycloviolacin o2 (cyo2), were isolated using reversed-phase hplc. initial activity screenings were conducted using radial diffusion assays (rdas) and mic assays with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus as test strains. for the most active peptide, cyo2, time-kill kinetics was determined in sodium phosphate buffer (containing 0.03% trypticase soy broth) against several gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species. charged residues in cyo2 were chemically modified and activity was determined in time-kill assays. results: cyo2 was the most active cyclotide and efficiently inhibited the growth of s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 and e. coli in rdas and mic assays, while the other peptides were less active. in time-kill assays, cyo2 also had bactericidal activity against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in contrast, none of the cyclotides had high activity against s. aureus. chemical masking of the charged glu and lys residues in cyo2 caused a near total loss of activity against salmonella, while masking arg caused a less pronounced activity reduction. conclusions: cyo2 is a cyclotide with potent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the charged residues in cyo2 are all required for optimum antibacterial activity. in combination with its previously demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and the general stability of cyclotides, cyo2 provides a promising scaffold for future drug design.
dramatic increase of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli in german intensive care units: secular trends in antibiotic drug use and bacterial resistance, 2001 to 2008.
introduction: the objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (icus). methods: the study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 german icus from 2001 through 2008. data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (ad) expressed as daily defined doses (ddd) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. results: total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 ddd/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). carbapenem use almost doubled to an ad of 151 in 2008. significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (ad of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (ad of 117 in 2008). aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (ad of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 26% and 20% (p = 0.006; trend test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (p = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3gc)-resistant escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (p < 0.001), 3gc-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (p < 0.001), imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (p = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant k. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. the resistance densities did not change for mrsa but increased significantly for vre faecium and 3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. in 2008, the resistance density for mrsa was 3.73, 0.48 for vre, 1.39 for 3gc-resistant e. coli and 0.82 for k. pneumoniae. conclusions: although total antibiotic use did not change over time in german icus, carbapenem use doubled. this is probably due to the rise in 3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant a. baumannii.
activity of topical antimicrobial agents against multidrug-resistant bacteria recovered from burn patients.
background: topical antimicrobials are employed for prophylaxis and treatment of  burn wound infections despite no established susceptibility breakpoints, which are becoming vital in an era of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria. we compared two methods of determining topical antimicrobial susceptibilities. methods: isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumanii-calcoaceticus (abc) from burn patients were tested using broth microdilution and agar well diffusion to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and zones of inhibition (zi). isolates had systemic antibiotic resistance and clonality determined. mdr included resistance to antibiotics in three or more classes. results: we assessed 22 esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, 20 abc (75% mdr), 20 p. aeruginosa (45% mdr), and 20 mrsa isolates. the most active agents were mupirocin for mrsa and mafenide acetate for the gram-negatives with moderate mics/zi found with silver sulfadiazene, silver nitrate, and honey. mdr and non-mdr isolates had similar topical resistance. there was no clonality associated with resistance patterns. conclusion: despite several methods to test bacteria for topical susceptibility, no defined breakpoints exist and standards need to be established. we recommend continuing to use silver products for prophylaxis against gram-negatives and mafenide acetate for treatment, and mupirocin for mrsa.
in vitro antimicrobial, anthelmintic and cyclooxygenase-inhibitory activities and phytochemical analysis of leucosidea sericea.
ethnopharmacological relevance: leucosidea sericea is used as a vermifuge and in  the treatment of ophthalmia by various tribes in southern african countries. aim of the study: the study aimed at screening leaves and stems of leucosidea sericea for pharmacological activity and validating the plant's traditional use. a general phytochemical screening was also carried out. materials and methods: petroleum ether (pe), dichloromethane (dcm), ethanol (etoh) and water extracts of the plant parts were investigated for antimicrobial, anthelmintic and cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitory activities. gram-positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) and candida albicans were used for the antimicrobial evaluation. caenorhabditis elegans was used for the anthelmintic assay using the microdilution technique. cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (cox-1 and -2) were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of the plant extracts. phytochemical analysis for phenolic compounds, including gallotannins, condensed tannins and flavonoids was done using 50% methanol extracts of the leaves and stems employing spectrophotometric methods. results: the leaf extracts exhibited broad spectrum antibacterial activity ranging from 0.025 to 6.25mg/ml. the most noteworthy minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.025 mg/ml was exhibited by pe and dcm leaf extracts against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. in the anthelmintic assay, the best minimum lethal concentration (mlc) value of 0.26 mg/ml was observed for the dcm and etoh leaf extracts. both leaf and stem organic solvent extracts exhibited high to moderate inhibition against cox-1 and -2 at a screening concentration of 250 microg/ml. at lower concentrations, the extracts displayed a dose-dependent inhibition, with the lowest ic(50) values of 0.06 microg/ml (cox-1) and 12.66 microg/ml (cox-2) exhibited by the pe extract of the leaves. generally, the leaf extracts exhibited better pharmacological activities and contained higher amounts of phenolic compounds than the stem extracts. alkaloids and saponins were only detected in the leaf and stem extracts, respectively. conclusion: the reported results support the local use of leucosidea sericea against eye infections and as a vermifuge. the pharmacological activities exhibited by the leaf extracts are probably due to their higher phenolic levels.
new quinoline derivatives: synthesis and investigation of antibacterial and antituberculosis properties.
four new series of quinoline derivatives were synthesized starting from 2-trifluoromethyl aniline through multi-step reactions. in the reaction sequence, substituted aniline was cyclized to 4-hydroxy quinoline 1, which was then transformed to 4-chloro-2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline 2. the key scaffold 4-hydrazinyl-2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline 3, obtained from the compound 2, was successfully converted to target quinoline derivatives, viz. hydrazones 4a-t, ureas 5a-e, thioureas 6a-c and pyrazoles 7a-d, in good yields. the newly synthesized title compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae (recultured) and antituberculosis activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h(37)rv and mdr-tb. preliminary results indicated that most of the hydrazone derivatives demonstrated very good antibacterial and antituberculosis activities while other derivatives showed moderate activity.

the antibacterial activity of zno nanoparticles has been investigated and presented in this paper. nanoparticles were prepared via non-hydrolytic solution process using zinc acetate di-hydrate (zn(ch(3)coo)(2).2h(2)o) and aniline (c(6)h(5)nh(2)) in 6 h refluxing at approximately 65 degrees c. in the presence of four pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae, the antibacterial study of zinc oxide nanoparticles were observed. the antibacterial activity of zno nanoparticles (zno-nps) were studied by spectroscopic method taking different concentrations (5-45 microg/ml) of zno-nps. our investigation reveals that the lowest concentration of zno-nps solution inhibiting the growth of microbial strain is found to be 5 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae, whereas for e. coli, s. aureus, and s. typhimurium, it was calculated to be 15 microg/ml. the diameter of each zno-nps lies between "20 and 30 nm" as observed from fesem and transmission electron microscopy images. the composition of synthesized material was analyzed by the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and it shows the band of zno at 441 cm(-1). additionally, on the basis of morphological and chemical observations, the chemical reaction mechanism of zno-nps was also proposed.
the global problem of antibiotic resistance.
amid the recent attention justly focused on the potential problem of microbial sources for weapons of bioterrorism, it is also apparent that human pathogens frequently isolated from infections in patients from community and hospital sources have been growing more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. much of the growth of multiple-drug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens can be contributed to the overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial products. however, an equally troubling and often overlooked component of the problem involves the elegant ways in which pathogenic bacteria continually evolve complex genetic systems for acquiring and regulating an endless array of antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. efforts to develop new antimicrobials have over the past two decades been woefully behind the rapid evolution of resistance genes developing among both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. several new agents that are best suited for use in the hospital environment have been developed to combat staphylococci resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobials following acquisition of the meca gene. however, the dramatic spread in the us of the now common community strain of staphylococcus aureus usa300 has shifted the therapeutic need for new antibiotics useful against mrsa to the community. as the pharmaceutical industry focused on discovering new agents for use against mrsa, hospitals in many parts of the world have seen the emergence of gram-negative pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae that are clinically resistant to almost all available antimicrobials. such mdr isolates usually contain multiple-resistance determinants, including loss of outer membrane porins via gene inactivation by chromosomally encoded insertion sequences, up-regulation of inate efflux pumps, as well as acquisition of drug-inactivating enzymes whose genes are encoded on self-transmissible plasmids, integrons, and complex transposable elements. these determinants confer a complex resistance phenotype that is often superimposed on mutations in the primary drug target in the cell. the continued evolution of such a complex array of antibiotic-resistance genes presents a formidable challenge at a time when large pharmaceutical companies have scaled down their presence in the anti-infectives arena.
essential oil from the underground parts of laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
the composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of laserpitium zernyi hayek (apiaceae) were investigated. the pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by gc and gc-ms. forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). the main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. the antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis), gram (-) bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (candida albicans). l. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against s. epidermidis, s. aureus and m. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
antimicrobial efficacy assessment of multi-use solution to disinfect hydrophilic  contact lens, in vitro.
purpose: to evaluate the efficacy of disinfecting solutions in hydrophilic contact lenses (cl). methods: two multi-use solutions denominated solution a (0.001% polyquaternium-1 and 0.0005% myristamidopropyl dimethylamine) and solution b (0.0001% polyaminopropyl biguanide) were used. the solutions were tested in hydrophilic contact lenses infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc27583), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc1226), klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc13883), staphylococcus aureus (atcc25923) and candida albicans (atcc 10231) and the decrease in microorganisms growth after the hydrophilic contact lenses were cleaned with the respective solutions was verified. the manufacture's instructions were followed. results: a decrease of 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and a decrease 100% of klebsiella pneumoniae was observed. conclusion: the solutions decreased the amount of microorganisms tested.
antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from more than 10,000 patients with infectious respiratory diseases: a 25-year longitudinal study.
the study group on antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from respiratory infections was established in 1981 in japan to elucidate trends in such susceptibilities in patients with infectious respiratory diseases; the group has conducted nationwide research in collaboration with 21 medical institutions. examination of more than 10,000 patients by 2005 allowed a summary of study findings. streptococcus pneumoniae started to become resistant to penicillin g in the 1990s, and the isolation rate of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp + prsp) reached almost 60% in 2001. the proportion of prsp also increased, reaching 19.4%. thereafter, the rate of pisp + prsp decreased somewhat to the mid-30% range. macrolide resistance was also observed; in 2005, the prevalence of strains highly susceptible to erythromycin with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml had decreased to 15.5%, whereas the proportion of highly resistant strains with mics >or= 128 microg/ml exceeded 40%. among staphylococcus aureus isolates, the proportion of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains began to increase rapidly in 1986 and constituted around 60% of all s. aureus strains identified in 1990 and in the following years. in 1993, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant isolates of haemophilus influenzae had increased remarkably, presumably related to the outbreak of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae strains, and the proportion of these strains among the isolates surpassed 30% in 2002 and thereafter. for klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of first- to fourth-generation cephems improved with each generation. the mic distribution patterns of pseudomonas aeruginosa shifted towards higher mics when compared with the mics for other pathogens. broad patterns with no distinct peaks reflected the difficulty in treating p. aeruginosa infection. regarding moraxella catarrhalis, beta-lactamase-producing strains already constituted a majority of the isolates in 1990, and the proportion of strains highly susceptible to ampicillin, with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml, was less than 10% at that time.
[analysis on the sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of respiratory-infectious isolates on the second survey on the sensitivity of isolates conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007--concerning the aspect of pk/pd break points].
sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of isolates clinically obtained from respiratory infection sites in adults on the second survey on sensitivity of isolates conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007 was investigated according to the classification of the "guideline for treatment for adult nosocomial pneumonia in 2008". among the primary antibacterial drugs for mild (a) and moderate (b) nosocomial pneumonia in adults, beta-lactam antibiotics; ceftriaxone (ctrx), sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc), panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp), tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs), meropenem (mepm), doripenem (drpm), biapenem (bipm) were studied to evaluate their clinical efficacy. the covering rate was analyzed using the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and break point of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd). consequently, the results with methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae revealed the mic90 of all antibacterial drugs to be at low levels, while almost 100% of isolates were within the range of pk/pd break points except bipm and sbt/abpc to h. influenzae, and sbt/abpc to k. pneumoniae. however, the analysis of p. aeruginosa didn't reach 100% for the covering rates of isolates, indicating that these drugs did not have a complete inhibitory action to restrict bacterial proliferation. the analysis of all 5 carbapenem drugs showed superiority to taz/pipc in mic90 while covering rates of isolates at pk/pd break points showed inferiority to taz/pipc. this tendency was found to be more significant in covering the rates of isolates on the regular dose with maximal bactericidal action and on the maximum dose. this is because the maximum dose approved in japan is as low as half that in ipm/cs and 1/3 that in mepm in western countries.
in vitro activity of tigecycline against 2423 clinical isolates and comparison of the available interpretation breakpoints.
mics to tigecycline and 12 antimicrobials were performed by microdilution method, against 2423 nonduplicate pathogens recently isolated in 17 greek hospitals. the food and drug administration (fda) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria were used comparatively for interpretation of tigecycline mics. tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro activity against the majority of the isolates tested. (mic(90) values of 0.5, 1, 2, 0.125, 1, 0.25, 0.125, and 1 mg/l were observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, respectively.) tigecycline activity was the same, irrespective of the resistance profile to other antimicrobials (gram-negative pathogens susceptible or resistant to imipenem, enterococcus spp., s. aureus, or s. pneumoniae isolates, susceptible or resistant to vancomycin, methicillin or penicillin, respectively). interpretation using eucast and fda breakpoints differed among isolates of k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. having tigecycline mics of 2 to 4 mg/l. in conclusion, tigecycline exhibited potent activity against pathogens recently isolated in a region that experiences high antimicrobial resistance rates. indications that the available criteria might categorize differently tigecycline susceptibility status in k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. isolates were also detected.
chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) fruits from different regions.
structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) obtained from different regions (germany, india, and turkey). the main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. it was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. the highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from germany and india was higher than that of kefe cumin fruits obtained from turkey. the fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris (fmc 1), proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus (fmc 19), aeromonas hydrophila (atcc 7965), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 15753), klebsiella pneumoniae (fmc 5), salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes (ccm 2531) and escherichia coli (atcc 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.

antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of plants from northeast of mexico.
traditional medicine has a key role in health care worldwide. obtaining scientific information about the efficacy and safety of the plants from our region is one of the goals of our research group. in this report, 17 plants were selected and collected in different localities from northeast mexico. the dried plants were separated into leaves, flowers, fruit, stems, roots and bark. each part was extracted with methanol, and 39 crude extracts were prepared. the extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity using three gram-negative bacterial strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii), three gram-positive bacterial strains (enterococcus faecalis and two staphylococcus aureus strains), and seven clinically isolated yeasts (candida albicans, c. krusei, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis and c. glabrata); their antioxidant activity was tested using a dpph free radical assay. no activity against gram-negative bacteria was observed with any extract up to the maximum concentration tested, 1000 mug ml(-1). we report here for the first time activity of ceanothus coeruleus against s. aureus (flowers, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) 125 mug ml(-1)), c. glabrata (mics 31.25 mug ml(-1)) and c. parapsilosis (mics between 31.25 and 125 mug ml(-1)); chrysanctinia mexicana against c. glabrata (mics 31.25 mug ml(-1)); colubrina greggii against e. faecalis (mics 250 mug ml(-1)) and cordia boissieri against c. glabrata (mic 125 mug ml(-1)). furthermore, this is the first report about antioxidant activity of extracts from ceanothus coeruleus, chrysanctinia mexicana, colubrina greggii and cyperus alternifolius. some correlation could exist between antioxidant activity and antiyeast activity against yeasts in the species ceanothus coeruleus, schinus molle, colubrina greggii and cordia boissieri.
evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
background: a single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. there is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (plts), and red blood cells. study design and methods: in this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (amps) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored plt concentrates (pcs). nine synthetic amps, four from plt microbicidal protein-derived peptides (pd1-4) and five arg-trp (rw) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and pc samples spiked with staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus cereus. a 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. results: in both plasma alone and pcs, rw3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae; pd4 and rw2 against p. aeruginosa; and rw4 against k. pneumoniae. the activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. conclusions: these findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic amps against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, pcs, and other blood products.
new antimicrobial agents for use in the intensive care unit.
timely provision of adequate antimicrobial coverage in an initial anti-infective  treatment regimen results in optimal outcomes for bacterial and fungal infections. however, selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens for treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (icu) can be challenging due to expansion of resistance, which typically requires use of multidrug anti-infective regimens to provide adequate coverage of important pathogens commonly seen in the icu setting. indeed, a recent additional call to action by the infectious diseases society of america (idsa) has enforced the impact that antimicrobial-resistant pathogens can have on patient care. the term eskape has been coined by this idsa group to refer to enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, the etiologic causes of the majority of hospital-acquired infections in the united states that are able to effectively "escape" our antibiotic arsenal and that also mandate discovery of new antimicrobial agents. this article reviews select antibacterial agents and an antifungal agent in late stages of clinical development that appear to have potential for treatment of infections in the icu.
synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(ii) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (osn2) schiff base ligands.
cobalt ion complexes with the schiff bases, (4-x-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (x=methoxy (ome), phenylazo (n(2)ph), bromo (br), nitro (no(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (c, h, n), ftir, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. the thermal stability of free ligands and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) and thermogravimetric analyses (tga). cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. the synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four gram-positive bacteria: streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus anthracis and also against the two gram-negative bacteria: klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity data show that the parent schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.

a new series of novel 5-(nitro/bromo)-styryl-2-benzimidazoles (1-12) has been synthesized by simple, mild and efficient synthetic protocol by attempted condensation of 5-(nitro/bromo)-o-phenylenediamine with trans-cinnamic acids in ethylene glycol. screening for in vitro anti-tubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h(37) rv, anti-bacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial strains and anti-fungal activity against candida albicans and asperigillus fumigatus fungal strains were carried out. compounds 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 showed higher anti-tubercular activity and compounds 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 have proved to be effective with mic (microg/ml) and emerged as lead molecules showing excellent activities against a panel of microorganisms. all synthesized compounds were characterized using ir, (1)h, (13)c nmr, gc-ms and elemental analysis.
synthesis, spectral and biological evaluation of some new thiazolidinones and thiazoles based on t-3-alkyl-r-2,c-6-diarylpiperidin-4-ones.
a stereospecific synthesis of some thiazolidinones and thiazoles was achieved conveniently through certain alpha-halo keto agents and reactivity of chloroacetyl chloride was successfully enhanced by csf-celite+ch(3)coona. nmr studies revealed that the configuration of n-n bond is found to be anti with respect to c-3 alkyl group while c=n bond in thiazolidinone is trans with respect to n-n bond. antimycobacterial activity tested against mycobacterium tuberculosis indicated that compounds 19, 20, 24, 29, 30 and 32 exhibited twofold enhanced potency than rifampicin. similarly, antimicrobial screening studies pointed out that compounds 21 and 28 exceptionally noticed promising activities and particularly, 21 against staphylococcus aureus and, 24 and 32 against rhizopus sp. exhibited onefold elevated inhibition potency whereas 21 against klebsiella pneumoniae showed twofold improved potency than ciprofloxacin and amphotericin b.
a study of 3-substituted benzylidene-1,3-dihydro-indoline derivatives as antimicrobial and antiviral agents.
3-substituted benzylidene-1,3-dihydro-indoline derivatives were tested for their  in vitro antibacterial activity against the gram-negative bacteria klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and the gram-positive bacteria bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and for their their in vitro antifungal activity against candida krusei and candida albicans. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were determined by the 2-fold serial dilution technique in mueller hinton broth and sabouraud dextrose agar using antibacterial and antifungal assays, respectively. for comparison of the antimicrobial activity, rifampicin, ampicillin trihydrate, gentamicin sulfate, and ofloxacin were used as reference antibacterial agents, and fluconazole and amphotericin b were employed as reference antifungal agents. the most active compound 10 showed notable inhibition against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and candida krusei. compounds 1 and 6 were found slightly effective against klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. in addition, compounds 13 and 14 showed inhibition against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. indole derivatives were also tested in vitro for replication of the hepad38 cell line and compared with lamivudine (3tc, l-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine). the ic50 values of the compounds were found to be >1000 microm against hbv except for compound 13 which exhibited activity with an ic50 value of 500 microm.
biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from staphylococcus aureus and its antimicrobial activity against mrsa and mrse.
silver bionanoparticles (agnps) have been known to have inhibitory and bactericidal effects. resistance to antimicrobial agents by pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years and is a major health problem. this report focuses on the synthesis of metallic bionanoparticles of silver using a reduction of aqueous ag+ ion with the culture supernatants of staphylococcus aureus. the bioreduction of the ag+ ions in the solution was monitored in the aqueous component and the spectrum of the solution measured through ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and characterized by atomic force microscopy. the agnps were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. the most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant s. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. from the clinical editor: silver bionanoparticles (agnps) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. the most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant s. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae.
synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-amino-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives.
a series of novel 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-amino-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and characterized by (1)h nmr, ms and hrms. these fluoroquinolones were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against representative gram-positive and gram-negative strains. all of the title compounds have considerable activity against the twelve strains, and exhibit exceptional potency in inhibiting the growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic): 0.06-8 microg/ml). the most active compound 17 is 4-fold more potent than levofloxacin against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, 32-fold more potent than levofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, and 16-fold more potent than imb against k. pneumoniae.
effect of soft segment crystallization and hard segment physical crosslink on shape memory function in antibacterial segmented polyurethane ionomers.
shape memory polyurethane (smpu) ionomers containing constant 75 wt.% soft segment content were synthesized using poly(epsilon-caprolactone)diol, 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 1,4-butanediol and/or n,n-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-isonicotinamide. to introduce substrate bonding antibacterial activity, pyridinium was prepared through a neutralization reaction using 1-iodooctane as neutralization agent. for the smpu ionomer film obtained, tensile testing at 70 degrees c and dynamic mechanical analysis suggests that, at temperatures>t(ms) (the melting point of soft segments), 6.72 and 29.55 mol.% pyridinium within hard segments significantly decreased the mechanical properties such as the stress at 100% elongation (70 degrees c), the initial modulus (70 degrees c) and the elastic modulus (75-110 degrees c). cyclic tensile investigation demonstrated that the two factors, soft segment crystallization and hard segment physical crosslink, play a very important role in shape memory function in smpu ionomers. for the each individual specimen, the fixity ratio increased, and the recovery ratio decreased with the extension of cooling time. after sufficient cooling time, the fixity ratio of all specimens can reach a high value (approximately 95%). owing to the disrupted physical crosslink in the sample containing 29.55 mol.% pyridinium, the crystallization rate of soft segments has less effect on shape fixity. therefore, a high fixity ratio (93.8%) can be achieved in a short cooling time (30 s). in the control sample, the fixity ratio is only 73.7% after 30 s cooling. in addition, the admirable substrate bonding antibacterial activity of prepared smpu ionomers was verified using standards aactt 147 and astm e2149 in comparison with the control sample. the antibacterial activity of smpu ionomers on gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus) is significant, and the rate of reduction of bacteria is 100%; the antibacterial activity on gram-negative bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae) increases from 83.6% to 90.7% with increase in pyridinium content from 6.72 to 29.55 mol.%.
cationic compounds with activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria: interest of a new compound compared with two older antiseptics, hexamidine and chlorhexidine.
use of antiseptics and disinfectants is essential in infection control practices  in hospital and other healthcare settings. in this study, the in vitro activity of a new promising compound, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene (cx1), has been evaluated in comparison with hexamidine (hx) and chlorhexidine (chx), two older cationic antiseptics. the mics for 69 clinical isolates comprising methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (with or without meca), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases and non-fermenting bacilli (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were determined. cx1 showed similar activity against s. aureus, cons and enterococcus spp., irrespective of the presence of meca or van genes, or associated resistance genes, with very good activity against cons (mic <1 mg/l). variable activities were observed against enterobacteriaceae; the mics determined seemed to be dependent both on the genus (mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively) and on the resistance phenotype production of [extended spectrum beta-lactase (esbls) or other beta-lactamases; overproduction of ampc]. poor activity was found against non-fermenting bacilli, irrespective of the resistance phenotype. chx appeared to be the most active compound against all strains, with broad-spectrum and conserved activity against multidrug-resistant strains. hx showed a lower activity, essentially against gram-positive strains. consequently, the differences observed with respect to cx1 suggest that they are certainly not the consequence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, but rather the result of membrane composition modifications (e.g. of lipopolysaccharide), or of the presence of (activated) efflux-pumps. these results raise the possibility that cx1 may be a potent new antibacterial agent of somewhat lower activity but significantly lower toxicity than chx.
regioselective synthetic approaches towards 1,2,8,9-tetraazadispiro[4.1.4.2]trideca-2,9-dien-6-ones of potential antimicrobial properties.
reaction of 2,5-bis(arylmethylidene)cyclopentanones 1a-d with nitrilimines (generated in situ via triethylamine dehydrohalogenation of the corresponding hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a,b) in 1:2 molar ratio proceeds in a high regioselective manner affording monocycloadducts 3 and dicycloadducts in the form of two isomers 4, 5. single crystal x-ray diffraction studies of the isolated crystalline form of 3c support the established structure and indicate that the formed product is 7e, 4s, 5r. antimicrobial activity screening of the synthesized compounds 3-5, utilizing a variety of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus fecalis and streptococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus vulgaris) and yeast (candida albicans), exhibited that all the prepared analogues acquire promising activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria especially compounds 3b, 4a (antimicrobial active agents against gram-positive bacteria) and 3c (antimicrobial active agent against gram-negative bacteria).
isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
aim of the study: the aerial parts of thymus kotschyanus boiss. and hohen. (lamiaceae) and flower buds of dianthus caryophyllus l. (caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. in this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. materials and methods: compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: tlc, ftir spectra and hplc. the minimum inhibitory concentrations mic values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. results: two known compounds were isolated from the essential oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. the isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thymol mic values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and b. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a mic value of 15.6 microg/ml. eugenol achieved stronger mic values against most tested pathogens and the best mic value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes and k. pneumoniae whereas, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and e. coli were inhibited with a mic value of 31.2 microg/ml. combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the best synergistic result was seen against p. mirabilis and e. coli. conclusions: the isolation of two antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.

aims: due to the emergence of multi-drug resistance, alternatives to conventional antimicrobial therapy are needed. this study aims to investigate the in vitro pharmacological interactions between essential oils (considered valuable as natural therapeutic treatments) and conventional antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin/amphotericin b) when used in combination. methods and results: interactions of the essential oils (melaleuca alternifolia, thymus vulgaris, mentha piperita and rosmarinus officinalis) when combined with ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus indicate mainly antagonistic profiles. when tested against klebsiella pneumoniae the isobolograms show antagonistic, synergistic and additive interactions depending on the combined ratio. the r. officinalis/ciprofloxacin combination against k. pneumoniae displayed the most favourable synergistic pattern. the interactions of m. alternifolia (tea tree), t. vulgaris (thyme), m. piperita (peppermint) and r. officinalis (rosemary) essential oils with amphotericin b indicate mainly antagonistic profiles when tested against candida albicans. conclusion: while a number of interactions show complete antagonism, others show varied (synergistic, additive and/or antagonistic) interactions, thus the efficacy is dependent on the ratio in which the two components co-exist. significance and impact of the study: the predominant antagonistic interactions noted here, suggests that some natural therapies containing essential oils should be used with caution when combined with antibiotics.
blood culture confirmed bacterial sepsis in neonates in a north indian tertiary care center: changes over the last decade.
the spectrum of organisms causing sepsis is different in developing countries. data on the recent trends of organisms causing sepsis are limited. this study was conducted in a tertiary care neonatal unit in northern india. all inborn babies with blood-culture-positive sepsis from 1995 to 2006 were divided into two epochs, viz. 1995 to 1998 (epoch i) and 2001 to 2006 (epoch ii). organisms were grouped into early (<72 h) and late onset (> or =72 h) sepsis groups. the overall incidence of sepsis, the incidence of sepsis stratified by weight groups, the organism profile on different days of life, sepsis-related mortality and pathogen-specific case fatality rate were calculated and compared between the two epochs. out of 34,362 live births during the study period, organisms were isolated in 1,491 neonates. out of these, 89% had bacterial sepsis. the incidence of neonatal bacterial sepsis increased from epoch i to epoch ii (35.8/1,000 versus 40.1/1,000 live births, p<0.05). the incidence of early onset sepsis (eos) did not change between the epochs, but the incidence of late onset sepsis (los) increased from 12 to 16.5 per 1,000 live births (p<0.001). the incidence of bacterial sepsis decreased significantly in the 1,000- to 1,999-g birth weight groups. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes decreased, whereas staphylococcus aureus increased in incidence during epoch ii. non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli emerged as a newly identified pathogen during epoch ii. sepsis-associated mortality decreased from 42 to 20%. the incidence of bacterial sepsis has decreased significantly in 1,000- to 1,999-g infants, with a significant reduction in sepsis-related mortality. new organisms have emerged in recent years. the organism profile in recent years has changed, with a significant overlap of organisms causing eos and los.
antimicrobial property of a herbal preparation containing dalbergia sissoo and datura tramonium with cow urine against pathogenic bacteria.
in this study, a herbal preparation containing dalbergia sissoo and datura stramoium with cow urine (dsds), was evaluated for its antibacterial potential against pathogenic strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. antibacterial activity was compared to standard antibiotic drugs i.e. chloramphenicol (30 mcg), ampicillin (10 mcg), nalidixic acid (10 mcg) and rifampicin (30 mcg). cow urine extract was found to be most active against both gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. clinical isolate of s. aureus showed higher sensitivity towards cow urine extract of dsds than standard strains, and inhibited growth on most regulatory levels such as inhibition of protein, dna, rna and peptidoglycan synthesis. the results of the present study shows that the cow urine extract of dsds may be used as a potent antiseptic preparation for prevention and treatment of chronic bacterial infections.

the aerial parts of salvia chloroleuca were collected at full flowering stage at  shahrestanak (tehran province of iran). the essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary gc and gc-ms. thirty-four components were identified, representing 98.5% of the total oil. beta-pinene (10.6%), alpha-pinene (9.0%), beta-caryophyllene (9.0%), 1,8-cineole (9.0%) and carvacrol (7.9%) were the main components. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of s. chloroleuca was studied against seven gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus niger); the disc diffusion method and mic values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity.
antibacterial terpenes from the oleo-resin of commiphora molmol (engl.).
two octanordammaranes, mansumbinone (1) and 3,4-seco-mansumbinoic acid (2), and two sesquiterpenes, beta-elemene (3) and t-cadinol (4) have been isolated from the oleo-resin of commiphora molmol (engl.). the structures of these compounds were established unambiguously by a series of 1d and 2d-nmr analyses. we have also unambiguously assigned all (1)h and (13)c nmr resonances for 2 and revised its (13)c data. the crude extract of the oleo-resin of c. molmol displayed potentiation of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline against s. aureus, several salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains and two k. pneumoniae strains. the antibacterial activity of terpenes 1-4 was determined against a number of staphylococcus aureus strains: sa1199b, atcc25923, xu212, rn4220 and emrsa15 and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be in the range of 4-256 microg/ml. the highest activity was observed by the seco-a-ring octanordammarane 2 with an mic of 4 microg/ml against sa1199b, a multidrug-resistant strain which over-expresses the nora efflux transporter, the major characterized antibiotic pump in this species. this activity compared favorably to the antibiotic norfloxacin with an mic of 32 microg/ml. compound 2 also displayed weak potentiation of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline activity against strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 and l10.
antibacterial behavior of transition-metals-decorated activated carbon fibers.
the antibacterial behavior of transition metals (cu or ag)-plated activated carbon fibers (acfs) was investigated. the pore structure of the acfs before and after metal electroplating was studied by n(2)/77 k isothermal adsorption. the antibacterial behavior against staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae was tested by a modified dilution method. as experimental results, the acfs showed a decrease in specific surface area and micro- and total pore volume with increasing metal content. the antibacterial behavior of the acfs was predominantly increased and showed over 99% against s. aureus as well as k. pneumoniae, attributed to the presence of metal nanoparticles in this system.

two abietane diterpenes were isolated from cyanobacteria microcoleous lacustris,  20-nor-3alpha-acetoxyabieta-5,7,9,11,13-pentaene and 20-nor-3alpha-acetoxy-12-hydroxy-abieta-5,7,9,11,13-pentaene. these compounds were assayed against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, salmonella typhi, vibrio cholerae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. both compounds showed activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. typhi, and v. cholerae, but not against the other bacteria.
antimicrobial activity of 2,5-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone from embelia schimperi.
chromatographic separation of an ethyl acetate extract from embelia schimperi led to the isolation of a new compound identified as 2,5-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (1) on the basis of spectroscopic and physical data. the plant's crude extract and pure compound 1 were assayed for in vitro antimicrobial activity against clinical strains of salmonella spp., proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, cryptococcus neoformans, shigella dysentriae and staphylococcus aureus. disc diffusion method was used and zones of inhibition, after respective incubation periods, were used to quantify antimicrobial activity. standard antibiotics namely: augmentin, cotrimoxazole, gentamycin, tetracycline and lyncomycin were used as controls. the crude extract was inactive while the pure compound 1 showed significant activities against salmonella spp., proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, cryptococcus neoformans, shigella dysentriae and staphylococcus aureus with zones of inhibition ranging from 10-20 mm. the most sensitive microorganism was p aeruginosa while c. neoformans was insensitive to both the crude extract and compound 1.
antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
the antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function.
trappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. in the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. we found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 microm, has significant activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans, in addition to p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. a similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 a62d/m63l, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to nacl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. this enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms.
optimized dosage and frequency of cefozopran for patients with febrile neutropenia based on population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis.
objectives: to establish a cefozopran (a fourth-generation cephem) population pharmacokinetic model using patient data and use it to explore alternative dosage regimens that could optimize the currently used dosing regimen to achieve higher likelihood of pharmacodynamic exposure against pathogenic bacteria. methods: we conducted a prospective clinical trial of cefozopran for haematological patients with febrile neutropenia (fn). twenty-two patients (30 episodes) were selected to receive intravenous cefozopran every 8 h on a daily basis. we gathered concentration data and performed the nonmem program. the monte carlo simulation was performed to assess the pharmacodynamic exposure based on the population pharmacokinetics and mic. results: the nonmem program demonstrated that a two-compartment model provided a best fit for the data, that is, cl of 4.62 (l/h), v1 of 10.3 (l), q of 4.47 (l/h), and v2 of 4.48 (l). on the basis of the japanese national surveillance findings for pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, viridans group streptococci, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, monte carlo simulation data showed that probability of target attainment(t>mic = 70%) is 67% to 97% for dosing every 8 h, and 48% to 88% for dosing every 12 h. for the patients in whom the efficacy of cefozopran could be evaluated, 17 of 22 patients (77.2%) survived the episode of fn without requiring further antibacterial treatment. conclusions: our study proved that monte carlo simulation based on population pharmacokinetics can determine optimized dosage and method. the optimal regimen for this cephem was found to be three times daily.
[microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
background: blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. methods: the species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the severance hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. results: of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococcus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of patients with enterococcus faecium and k. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. enterococcus, s. aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. e. coli, enterococcus spp., k. pneumoniae and s. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenemresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii increased. conclusions: e. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and s. aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and k. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. the bacteremia due to enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
biological screening of some turkish medicinal plant extracts for antimicrobial and toxicity activities.
screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 turkish plants was conducted. antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. extracts of tussilago farfara leaves, helichyrsum plicatum flowers, solanum dulcamara aerial parts and urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory activity against s. pyogenes, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (lc50 was <1000 mg l(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. for radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg l(-1) and 10,000 mg l(-1)). at low concentration (10,000 mg l(-1)), s. dulcamara aerial parts and primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with s. dulcamara aerial parts.

aims: the traditional uses of the aerial parts of fresh plectranthus cylindraceus by the dhofaris in oman were investigated on the basis of antimicrobial properties and composition of its herb oil. methods and results: the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of the herb oil of p. cylindraceus against human pathogenic bacteria and yeast were assessed using the broth microdilution method, and the percentage growth inhibition of fungi was determined according to the poisoned food technique. the oil exhibited good activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans with mic values in the range of 7.8-62.5 microg ml(-1) and also inhibited the growth of microsporum canis, microsporum gypseum, trichophyton rubrum, alternaria alternata, bipolaris sp., curvularia lunata, fusarium oxysporum and stemphylium solani for about a week at 250 microg ml(-1). the two most abundant components of the oil were identified as carvacrol (46.8%) and alpha-terpinolene (18.2%) based on gas chromatography-mass spectra (gc-ms) and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) analyses. conclusions: the oil has a pleasant odour and showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. such bioactivity could be attributed in part to carvacrol. significance and impact of the study: this study has demonstrated the broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of the herb oil of p. cylindraceus as well as the organic composition of this plant extract. this study provides scientific insight into the ancient practice of utilizing p. cylindraceus as a fragrant disinfectant.
a 7-year national survey on bacterial resistance in bronchoalveolar lavage from patients hospitalized in argentina.
the purpose of this study is to undertake a nationwide survey on bacterial resistance in bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) from patients hospitalized in argentina. a 2-month point prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (april-may and october-november) from 1997 to 2003 by 36 argentinean centers. antimicrobial susceptibility data of the potential pathogens recovered from the bal (samples containing <1% of squamous epithelial cells and bacterial counts >or=10(4) cfu/ml) of inpatients (i.e., >or=48-h hospital length of stay) with suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) were collected on a computerized system (sir) described previously. the survey was split into 2 periods for comparison purposes, 1997 to 2000 and 2001 to 2003. a total of 752 organisms were included. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent species, followed by acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in both periods, more than a half of the klebsiella pneumoniae strains displayed a phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer. a doubling of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter frequency was shown from the 1st period to the 2nd one (25-48%). more than two-thirds of the s. aureus strains proved to be methicillin resistant in both periods, and a pronounced decrease of resistance rates to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and rifampin was shown in the 2nd period. the present study shows the worrisome increasing bacterial resistance in bal samples to most available antimicrobial options for treating patients with suspected hap. variations over time support the need for systematic tailored surveillance and compel us to establish a rational usage of antimicrobial agents in our country.
broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.
functional finishing of cotton fabrics using silver nanoparticles.
we have reported a novel in situ synthesis protocol for silver nanoparticles onto cotton fabrics. here, cotton fabric immersed in silver nitrate solution is autoclaved at 15 psi, 121 degrees c for 15 min. at this temperature and pressure, the aldehyde terminal of starch (residual size material on cotton fabric) reduced the silver nitrate to silver metal and simultaneously stabilized the nanoparticles on fabric itself. the uv-visible absorption spectrum of both cotton fabrics and bath solution showed a typical absorption peak at 420 nm corresponding to the surface plasmon resonance of silver nanoparticles. with the help of transmission electron micrographs, the average size of the dislodged silver nanoparticles in water is calculated to be 20.9 +/- 13.7 nm. this silver nanoparticles impregnated cotton fabrics showed excellent antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and bacteriostasis activity against klebsiella pneumoniae. also, silver nanoparticles impregnated fabrics expressed significant uv-protection capability in comparison with the untreated fabrics.
in vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of h2 receptor antagonists.
enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.
in vitro antibacterial efficacy of monocryl plus antibacterial suture (poliglecaprone 25 with triclosan).
background: this study evaluated the in vitro efficacy of poliglecaprone 25 suture with triclosan against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods: poliglecaprone 25 sutures with and without triclosan were tested for in vitro efficacy against staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli by a zone of inhibition assay. the suture also was tested against escherichia coli in a colonization assay in a dynamic model simulating in vivo conditions. an in vitro triclosan diffusion assay and a sustained efficacy assay were performed by concurrent high-performance liquid chromatography and zone of inhibition assay. to assess stability, antibacterial efficacy testing was performed on samples held more than five months at elevated temperature. results: poliglecaprone 25 suture with triclosan demonstrated significant in vitro efficacy against a range of bacteria. the suture sustained in vitro efficacy for 11 days, corresponding to the in vitro triclosan diffusion profile. conclusion: triclosan reduced in vitro colonization of poliglecaprone 25 suture by several strains of bacteria compared with untreated control sutures.
multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospitalized children: a 5-year multicenter study.
objective: the objective of this study was to determine the incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospitalized children. methods: this multicenter study was conducted in 5 hospitals in the paris area from 1999 to 2003. we recorded all isolations of multidrug-resistant bacteria from clinical samples that were obtained from hospitalized children. strains that were isolated during systematic screening for carriers were excluded. results: the mean incidences were 0.9 per 1000 hospitalization-days for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 0.45 for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.32 for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae other than klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.40 for enterobacter species with derepressed cephalosporinase, and 0.01 for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. the incidences per 1000 hospitalization-days of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae other than klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter species with derepressed cephalosporinase decreased significantly from 1999 to 2003, whereas the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus remained very low. the proportion of resistant strains within the species did not vary significantly for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (11% to 9.6%), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae other than klebsiella pneumoniae (1.1%), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (0.03% to 0.023%). in contrast, the frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae decreased from 31.6% to 7.4%, and that of enterobacter species with derepressed cephalosporinase decreased from 38.8% to 18.5%. conclusions: we report significant decreases in the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae other than klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter species with derepressed cephalosporinase in hospitalized children during a 5-year period.

anthocephalus cadamba (roxb.) miq. syn a. chinensis (lamk) a. rich (rubiaceae) is ethnomedicinally widely used in the form of paste by tribe in western ghats for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobial potential of a. cadamba against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. the alchoholic and aqueous extract of this plant showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four fungi candida albicans, trichophyton rubrum--dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus and aspergillus nidulans--systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that a. cadamba extract has potent wound healing capacity as shown from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that a. cadamba extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of crude extracts from plants bryophyllum pinnatum and kalanchoe crenata.
extracts from the leaves of bryophyllum pinnatum and kalanchoe crenata were screened for their antimicrobial activities. solvents used included water, methanol, and local solvents such as palmwine, local gin (seaman's schnapps 40% alcoholic drink,) and "omi ekan-ogi" (sour water from 3 days fermented milled maize). leaves were dried and powdered before being soaked in solvents for 3 days. another traditional method of extraction by squeezing raw juice from the leaves was also employed. all extracts were lyophilized. these extracts were tested against some gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli atcc 25922, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella paratyphi, citrobacter spp); gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus atcc 25213, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis) and a fungus (candida albicans). agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at concentrations of 512 mg/ml to 4 mg/ml. all the organisms except candida albicans were susceptible to the extracts obtained from the traditional method. the squeezed-leaf juice of kalanchoe crenata was the most active one with mic of 8 mg/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus subtilis, 32 mg/ml against shigella flexneri, 64 mg/ml against escherichia coli and 128 mg/ml against the control strain staphylococcus aureus while its mbc is 256 mg/ml against these organisms except bacillus subtilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. the gram-positive organisms were more sensitive to the methanol and local gin-extract of bryophyllum pinnatum. extracts from other solvents showed moderate to weak activity.
antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
in the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-o-alpha-l-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-o-alpha-l-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. on the other hand, both dna virus herpes simplex (hsv) and rna virus parainfluenza-3 (pi-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using madin-darby bovine kidney and vero cell lines. according to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against s. aureus and e. faecalis with mic values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by e. coli (2 microg/ml), k. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), a. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and b. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited c. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. however, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards pi-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (cpe).
comparisons of parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins tested against bacterial  isolates from pediatric patients: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998-2004).
a contemporary collection of 12737 strains from pediatric patients (<18 years) isolated over a 7-year period (1998-2004) from 52 sentinel hospitals in north america was tested to determine the comparative antimicrobial potency of broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporins and selected comparator agents. most of the strains (84.1%) were isolated from blood stream or respiratory tract infections. the rank order of the top 10 pediatric pathogens analyzed was streptococcus pneumoniae (15.5%) >haemophilus influenzae (14.6%) >staphylococcus aureus (13.8%) >moraxella catarrhalis = coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.0%) >escherichia coli (7.8%) >pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.2%) >klebsiella spp. (4.8%) >enterococcus spp. (4.7%) > beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.4%). both cefepime and ceftriaxone (mic(90), 1 microg/ml; 93.9% and 93.7% susceptible, respectively) were highly active against s. pneumoniae. however, the s. pneumoniae strains showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (56.6%), as well as penicillin (56.6%) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (57.1%) < erythromycin (66.2%) < tetracycline (71.4%). beta-hemolytic streptococci showed 100.0% susceptibility to penicillin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. cefepime and ceftriaxone exhibited high activity against oxacillin (methicillin)-susceptible s. aureus, (mic(90), 4 microg/ml; 100.0% and 99.8% susceptible, respectively), whereas ceftazidime (mic(90), 16 microg/ml) was active against only 86.7% of strains. h. influenzae strains showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin (mic(90), < or =0.5 microg/ml; 100.0%), and 34.0% of h. influenzae and 99.2% of m. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. although the 3 cephalosporins tested (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) were very active (98.6-99.6% susceptible) against e. coli, cefepime (99.0% susceptible) was slightly more active than ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (96.4% and 95.1% susceptible, respectively) against klebsiella spp. cefepime was also the most active beta-lactam agent tested against enterobacter spp. (mic(90), 2 microg/ml; 99.3% susceptible), whereas the susceptibility rates of other broad-spectrum beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam) were significantly lower (78.4-81.5%). against p. aeruginosa, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed the highest susceptibility rates (94.4% and 93.3%, respectively), whereas imipenem and cefepime showed the lowest resistance rates (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). our results indicate that cefepime was the most broad-spectrum cephalosporin analyzed and remains a very potent alternative for the treatment of contemporary pediatric infections in north america.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). i. susceptibility distribution].
the bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2004 and july 2005. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. the strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). against staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (abk), vancomycin (vcm) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/ml. against enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (abpc) and vcm showed a strong antibacterial activity. the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (czop) and cefpirome (cpr) showed the strongest activity (mic90: < or = 125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli [mic of ciprofloxacin (cpfx): > or = 4 microg/ml] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. against klebsiella pneumoniae, czop, meropenem (mepm), and carumonam (crmn) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. the antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. against serratia marcescens, imipenem (ipm) and gentamicin (gm) had the strongest antibacterial activity. against proteus mirabilis, crmn showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. mepm prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/ml. next, cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), czop, cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), and cefditoren (cdtr) showed a strong activity. the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/ml except ipm and mepm having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activities of czop and caz were considered to be relatively good on mic50 comparison (mic50: 2 microg/ml).
bafoudiosbulbins a, and b, two anti-salmonellal clerodane diterpenoids from dioscorea bulbifera l. var sativa.
two clerodane diterpenoids, bafoudiosbulbins a 1, and b 2, together with five known compounds: tetracosanoic acid, 1-(tetracosanoyl)-glycerol, trans-tetracosanylferulate, beta-sitosterol and 3-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-beta-sitosterol were isolated from the tubers of dioscorea bulbifera l. var sativa. their structures were established by spectroscopic methods (1d and 2d-nmr, ms) and x-ray crystallographic diffraction analysis of compound 1. the ch2cl2-soluble portion of the crude extract and the two clerodanes were screened for anti-bacterial activity using both agar diffusion and broth dilution techniques against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, salmonella paratyphi a and salmonella paratyphi b. they both showed significant activities against p. aeruginosa, s. typhi, s. paratyphi a and s. paratyphi b.
antimicrobial susceptibility of community and hospital acquired bacteria.
objectives: to study the antibiotic susceptibility of common community- and hospital-acquired bacteria in thailand. material and method: eight common bacterial pathogens were studied in 24 hospitals across thailand in 2002-2003. isolates of clinically proven infections were tested for their susceptibility by agar-based disc diffusion method. results: a total of 9,091 isolates of target bacteria were studied. community and hospital acquired bacteria accounted for 54.9% and 45.1% respectively. community acquired escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., enterobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus were more susceptible to antimicrobials compared to hospital acquired strains. the difference in susceptibility of community-acquired vs hospital acquired pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus spp. was less impressive indicating the spread of hospital strains into the community. bacteria isolated from the blood stream were more susceptible to antimicrobials compared to those from the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical sites. acinetobacter spp. and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible to antimicrobials compared to others. conclusion: decreased susceptibility to antimicrobials was found in all bacteria tested. the susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials of community-acquired bacteria decreased to a critical level indicating the widespread resistant bacteria to the community.
antimicrobial activity of substance p and neuropeptide y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically substance p and neuropeptide y. since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. neuropeptide y and substance p had antimicrobial activity against e. coli (mic 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml sem and 71.5+/-15 sem microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (mic>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (mic>500 microg/ml). while substance p and neuropeptide y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. however, this remains to be determined.
quinine sulfate inhibits invasion of some bacterial skin pathogens.
background: as some of the many patients who receive antimalarials for the treatment of noninfective inflammatory diseases (lupus erythematosus, collagen vascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and others) are also immunosuppressed because of their disease and/or treatments, and may have concomitant bacterial infections, we investigated the effect of these drugs on the growth and invasion of several bacteria that are commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections to determine whether they could protect against such conditions and obviate the need for an additional antibiotic drug. methods: the effect of quinine sulfate (qs) at concentrations of 50 and 100 microm on the entry process of enterobacter agglomerans, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae into caco-2 cells was studied during the infection period. the invasive efficiency was expressed as the number of viable internalized bacteria obtained by counting the colony-forming units (cfus). results: the invasive ability of e. agglomerans and s. aureus was significantly inhibited by 50 and 100 microm qs in a dose-dependent manner when the drug was added to caco-2 cell monolayers during the infection period; however, qs had no significant effect on the internalization of p. aeruginosa or k. pneumoniae. discussion and conclusions: antimalarial drugs are currently widely used to treat patients with autoimmune dermatologic and rheumatologic diseases, and have also been recently proposed as additional therapy for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. these patients, who are often immunocompromised, may receive a secondary advantage from these antimalarials, which may provide some protection against staphylococci (amongst the most important human pathogens causing many superficial and systemic infections) and e. agglomerans.

plagiochasma appendiculatum (aytoniaceae) of the order marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by gaddi tribe in kangra valley for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobical potential of plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. the plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi candida albicans and cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus spinulosus, aspergillus terreus and aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.
in vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide schiff's bases and their cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes.
isonicotinoylhydrazide schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their co (ii), cu (ii), ni (ii) and zn (ii) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glabrata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. the brine shrimp bioassay indicated schiff's bases, l3 and l6 and, their cu (ii) and ni (ii) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (ld50 > 1000).
surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the estonian experience.
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive gram-negative pathogens in estonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) protocols. despite the higher rate of gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for gram negative pathogens. the higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl)-producing strains was 23% among klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among e. coli. the inclusion of invasive gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.
evaluation of the antimicrobial properties of different parts of citrus aurantifolia (lime fruit) as used locally.
we investigated the potency of citrus aurantifolia (lime fruit), against pathogens, in the different forms in which this fruit plant is used locally (juice of the fruit, burnt rind of the fruit commonly known as "epa-ijebu" in the yoruba dialect) and the oil obtained from steam distillation of the fruit. the antimicrobial activity of "epa-ijebu" in different solvents was also compared. the solvents include palm-wine (a local alcoholic drink tapped from palm trees), seaman's schnapps 40% alcoholic drink, water, ethanol and fermented water from 3 days soaked milled maize known as "ekan-ogi" or "omidun" in the yoruba dialect. antimicrobial activity was carried out by the agar well diffusion. the clinical isolates used included anaerobic facultative bacteria, namely: staphylococcus aureus atcc 25213, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella paratyphi, shigella flexnerii, streptococcus faecalis, citrobacter spp, serratia spp, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and escherichia coli; fungi such as aspergillus niger and candida albicans; and anaerobes which includes bacteroides spp, porphyromonas spp, and clostridium spp. crude extracts of all solvents used varied in zones of inhibition. the anaerobes and the gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to all the extracts with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 32 mg/ml-128 g/ml. the activity against the fungi showed only the oil extract potent for a. niger, while candida albicans was susceptible to all the extracts with mic ranging from 256 mg/ml-512 mg/ml. the gram-negatives have mic ranging from 64 mg/ml-512 mg/ml. minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranged between 32 mg/ml to 512 mg/ml depending on isolates and extracting solvent. the oil and palm-wine extract of "epa-ijebu" showed greater activity than the other extracts. the killing rate of the schnapps extract on s. aureus and e. coli was 1 and 3.5 hours respectively.
synthesis and in vitro microbiological evaluation of imidazo(4,5-b)pyridinylethoxypiperidones.
a series of imidazo(4,5-b)pyridinylethoxypiperidones was designed, synthesized and characterized for evaluation of potential antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against candida albicans-6, candida albicans, aspergillus niger, candida albicans-51 and aspergillus flavus. structure-activity relationship led to the conclusion that compound 39 exerted strong in vitro antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus whereas compounds 38 and 39 displayed promising antifungal activity against aspergillus flavus. the interesting antimicrobial profile of compound 39 led us to select this derivative for further development.
antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cholinesterase and mutagenic effects of extracts obtained from some trees used in south african traditional medicine.
extracts obtained from 10 trees used in south african traditional medicine were screened for antibacterial, anti-inflammatory (cox-1 and cox-2) and anti-cholinesterase activities and investigated for potential mutagenic effects using the ames test. antibacterial activity was detected using the disc-diffusion and micro-dilution assays. the extracts were tested against gram-positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. of the 78 different plant extracts investigated, 80% showed activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in the disc-diffusion assay. in the micro-dilution assay, 60% of the plant extracts showed minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values < or =1.56 mg ml(-1). the lowest mic value (0.092 mg ml(-1)) was recorded for an ethyl acetate root extract of acacia sieberiana against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. in the anti-inflammatory assay, 70% of the investigated plant extracts (0.25 mg ml(-1)) inhibited both cox-1 and cox-2 activity (>50% and 70% for water and organic solvent extracts, respectively). an ethyl acetate leaf extract of trichilia dregeana showed selective inhibition of cox-2 (81%). in the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory test, 21% of the plant extracts were active at a concentration < or =1 mg ml(-1) using the micro-dilution assay. the lowest ic(50) value was 0.04 mg ml(-1) obtained with an ethanol bark extract of combretum kraussii. none of the investigated plants showed any potential mutagenic effects.
in-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
a series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against organisms causing community-acquired respiratory tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia.
emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of gram-positive, gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the us food and drug administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. in this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were haemophilus influenzae (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), klebsiella spp. (5.6%), s. pneumoniae (4.6%), acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), enterobacter spp. (4.0%), escherichia coli (3.8%), serratia marcescens (2.5%), enterococcus spp. (2.3%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). at a concentration of 4 microg/ml, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, p. aeruginosa). s. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (mic50 and mic90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/ml. streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and s. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest mic being 0.12 microg/ml. all e. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/ml, and all klebsiella (25.8% esbl phenotype) and enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/ml. tigecycline was also active against acinetobacter spp. and s. maltophilia strains (mic50 and mic90, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively). further clinical studies should consider the role that tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.
characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tenerife cheese: initial characterization of plantaricin tf711, a bacteriocin-like substance produced by lactobacillus plantarum tf711.
aims: the screening and initial characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) from raw tenerife goats' cheese with possible application as biopreservatives or ripening accelerators for tenerife cheese. methods and results: one hundred and eighty lab of the genera lactobacillus (95), leuconostoc (64) and lactococcus (21) isolated from raw tenerife goats' cheese were screened for the production of antimicrobial substances. lactobacillus plantarum tf711, which had the broadest spectrum of antimicrobial activity, was selected for further characterization. the antimicrobial compound was determined as a proteinaceous substance, as it was sensitive to proteases. the bacteriocin-like substance, which we called plantaricin tf711, was active against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes and staphylococcus aureus; and against the enterobacteriaceae shigella sonnei and klebsiella pneumoniae. it was stable to heat and to treatment with surfactants and organic solvents. highest antimicrobial activity was found between ph 1 and 9. plantaricin tf711 exhibited primary metabolite kinetics, a bacteriostatic mode of action and a molecular mass of c. 2.5 kda as determined by tricine sds-page. conclusions: lact. plantarum tf711 produces a low molecular mass bacteriocin-like compound with a wide spectrum of activity and interesting technological properties (thermostability, good ph stability and stability against surfactants and organic solvents). significance and impact of the study: plantaricin tf711 was found to have potential for use as a biopreservative in the food industry.
temporal changes in bacterial resistance in german intensive care units, 2001-2003: data from the sari (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units) project.
conservative testing revealed a stable antibiotic resistance situation for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae in 32 german intensive care units (icus) actively participating in the sari (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in icus) project over a three-year period (2001--2003). no significant changes were shown for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (p=0.501; the mrsa rate increased in 18 icus and decreased in 14 icus). the only exception was an increase in ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli.
antagonistic activity of a natural fungal population towards pathogenic bacteria. an in vitro study.
in the present work, we performed in vitro testing of 33 species of fungi of the  subdivision deuteromycotina isolated from water and sediment of the kolubara river for antagonistic action towards 11 species of pathogenic bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria, the species most sensitive to metabolic fluid of the fungi were proteus mirabilis, salmonella enteritidis, and shigella sonnei, while the most resistant were klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium. of gram-positive bacteria, the most sensitive species was staphylococcus aureus, while the most resistant was enterococcus faecalis. of the tested fungi, penicillium canescens, p. simplicissimum, p. thomii, aspergillus fumigatus, a. ochraceus, and fusarium culmorum exerted inhibitory action on the greatest number of species of pathogenic bacteria, while verticillium lateritium, v. tenerum, phoma humicola, and botrytis cinerea had an inhibiting effect on the least number of species.
antibacterial potential from indian suregada angustifolia.
phytochemical analysis of the leaves from indian suregada angustifolia (baill. ex muell. arg.) airy shaw (euphorbiaceae) resulted in the isolation and identification of six known compounds, viz. friedelin, epi-friedelinol, n-octacosanol, alpha-amyrin, beta-sitosterol and beta-sitosterol-3-beta-d-glucopyranoside. aqueous (room temperature, boiled and autoclaved) and various solvent (methanol, chloroform and hexane) extracts of leaves were tested against 12 human pathogenic bacteria by the agar well-diffusion method. aqueous extracts did not express any activity. antibacterial activity was recorded in the order of methanol, hexane and chloroform extracts. maximum activity recorded against staphylococcus aureus (skin infections) in methanol and hexane extracts and moderate activity recorded against diarrhoea causing bacteria, vibrio vulnificus (hexane extract) and vibrio cholerae (chloroform extract).
molecular cloning and characterization of three beta-defensins from canine testes.
mammalian beta-defensins are small cationic peptides possessing broad antimicrobial and physiological activities. because dogs are particularly resilient to sexually transmitted diseases, it has been proposed that their antimicrobial peptide repertoire might provide insight into novel antimicrobial therapeutics and treatment regimens. to investigate this proposal, we cloned the full-length cdna of three canine beta-defensin isoforms (cbd-1, -2, and -3) from canine testicular tissues. their predicted peptides share identical n-terminal 65-amino-acid residues, including the beta-defensin consensus six-cysteine motif. the two longer isoforms, cbd-2 and -3, possess 4 and 34 additional amino acids, respectively, at the c terminus. to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of cbd, a 34-amino-acid peptide derived from the shared mature peptide region was synthesized. canine beta-defensin displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus; mics of 6 and 100 mug/ml, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; mics of 20 to 50, 20, and 50 mug/ml, respectively), and yeast (candida albicans; mic of 5 to 50 mug/ml) and lower activity against ureaplasma urealyticum and u. canigenitalium (mic of 200 mug/ml). antimicrobial potency was significantly reduced at salt concentrations higher than 140 mm. all three canine beta-defensins were highly expressed in testis. in situ hybridization indicated that cbd-1 was expressed primarily in sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules. in contrast, cbd-2 was located primarily within leydig cells. the longest isoform, cbd-3, was detected in sertoli cells and to a lesser extent in the interstitium. the tissue-specific expression and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that canine beta-defensins play an important role in host defense and other physiological functions of the male reproductive system.
comparison of trends of resistance rates over 3 years calculated from results for all isolates and for the first isolate of a given species from a patient.
we compared trends of annual resistance rates calculated from results for all isolates and for the first isolate of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumannii per patient over a 3-year period from 2001 through 2003. antimicrobial susceptibility results of inpatients were extracted from a computerized database. annual resistance rates of a species were calculated by two methods: (i) from results for all isolates, even those from patients with multiple isolates in a given year and (ii) from results for the first isolate from a patient in a given year, regardless of susceptibility profile or specimen type. rates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) did not differ among all isolates (79.9, 78.8 and 79.6%; p = 0.86), but decreased for the first isolate per patient (70.2, 65.7, and 64.1%; p = 0.006) over time. annual duplication rates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) decreased (39.6, 37.6, and 31.7%; p = 0.01), but those of mrsa increased significantly (64.3, 67.8, and 68.9%; p = 0.004). rates of cefotaxime-resistant k. pneumoniae did not differ over time by either method, and rates of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii decreased over time by both methods. duplication rates did not differ for either susceptible or resistant isolates of k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii. the trends in mrsa rate differed by the two methods because of the different proportion of duplicate isolates per year. mrsa rates might be increasingly overestimated for all isolates. these results suggest that the method of calculating results for the first isolate per patient may remove the effect of duplication, allowing the simple and unambiguous analysis of cumulative susceptibility rates.
[antimicrobial activity of organic extracts isolated from aplysina fistularis (demospongiae: aplysinidae)].
organic extracts of the sponge aplysina fistularis (pallas 1766) were tested for  antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and toxic activity of extract were determined. susceptibility trials of organic fractions obtained by vlc: hexane, etoac and chcl3 showed that etoac fraction has antibacterial activity against e. coli, while chcl3 fraction inhibited e. coli and s. aureus growth. the later refractioning of etoac fraction and the biodirected assays showed that fractions f12 and f13 of etoac/hex and etoac f14 were bioactive against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. only etoac/meoh sf2 from subfractionig of etoac f14 produced inhibition for e. coli and s. aureus. in sf2 etoac/meoh, mic was moderate for s. aureus (mic > 256 g/ml). f4 chcl3/meoh produced a high inhibition in s. aureus (mic = 0.125 g/ml) and for e. coli (mic > 16 g/ml). f10 chcl3/meoh showed a moderate activity against s. aureus (mic > 128 g/ml) and low activity against e. coli (mic = 512 g/ml). f10 chcl3/meoh did no present toxic activity against artemia salina. the fractiorts f4 chcl3/meoh and sf2 etoac/meoh were toxic for this organism when the concentration was higher than 100 microg/ml. lc50 in both cases was 548.4 and 243.4 microg/ml respectively. secondary metabolites of medium polarity obtained from a. fistularis have a wide spectrum of anti bacterial activity. toxicity analysis suggests that only f10 chcl3/meoh has potential as an antimicrobial agent for clinical use.
[search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria most commonly isolated from bone related infections: the role of cephalosporins in antimicrobial therapy.
bone infections, which can be acute or chronic, often require aggressive antibiotic therapy, whether treated at home or in the community. surveillance programmes are essential tools in the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and can act as a resource to maintain effective prescribing. the surveillance network (tsn), which collects organism and patient-specific data from a network of laboratories across the united states, was used to analyse susceptibility of common bacterial species isolated from bone infections during 2000-2002. narrow-spectrum antimicrobials such as vancomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid demonstrated good activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, and were active against 100% of isolates. however, gram-negative species were also commonly isolated from these sites of infection. later-generation cephalosporins, represented by ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and cefepime, exhibited a broad spectrum of activity including enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, but they were not active against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and showed variable activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. using ceftazidime as a marker for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) expression, less than 3% of escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae expressed this phenotype. based on current in vitro activity, the third-generation cephalosporins provide broad-spectrum coverage useful for the empirical therapy of suspected bone infections, especially for patients treated in the community or hospitalised with community-acquired infections.
antimicrobial activity in methanolic extracts of several plant species from northern argentina.
thirty-nine native plant species were collected from the provinces of chaco and formosa, in northern argentina, and were screened for antimicrobial activity. the plants were dried and extracted thoroughly with methanol. the dry extracts, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, were tested for inhibition of microbial growth via microplate assay with an oxidation-reduction dye. the test organisms were: escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. inhibition of respiratory activities in some of these microbial species was produced by the extracts of astronium balansae, geoffroea decorticans, peltophorum dubium, geoffroea spinosa, lantana balansae, prosopis kuntzei, prosopis ruscifolia and bulnesia sarmientoi, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 0.08 to 0.5 mg dry matter/ml. further in vitro experiments measuring the growth of s. aureus in liquid culture confirmed that all of the above extracts at 2 x mic were able to inhibit bacterial growth effectively, and that some of them (a. balansae, g. decorticans, p. dubium, g. spinosa, p. kuntzei and b. sarmientoi) were able to reduce the initial number of viable counts by at least one order of magnitude in 10 hours, indicating that these extracts should be investigated further for the possible presence of bactericidal components.
challenges in antimicrobial drug discovery and the potential of nucleoside antibiotics.
antimicrobial resistance in hospital and community settings is growing at an alarming rate and has been attributed to such organisms as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococci with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multi-drug resistant pseudomonas spp., klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp, and acinetobacter spp., as well as streptococcus pneumoniae with decreased susceptibility to penicillin and other antibacterials. to address the need for new therapies to combat resistant organisms, drug companies are refocusing their discovery efforts on developing novel agents with new mechanisms of action. the hope is that rapidly emerging technologies including combinatorial chemistry, high throughput screening, proteomics and microbial genomics will have a positive impact on antimicrobial drug discovery. these technologies should aid in the identification of novel drug targets and compounds with unique mechanisms of action other than those currently provided by the traditional antibiotics. nucleosides are one class of compounds worthy of further investigation as antibacterials since some derivatives have shown moderate to good activity against specific bacterial strains. for example, 5'-peptidyl nucleoside derivatives can inhibit peptide deformylase, an enzyme essential for bacterial survival that is not vital to human cells. this review also includes a list of miscellaneous nucleosides that have been synthesized as potential antibacterials. more detailed investigations on structure, as it relates to the antimicrobial activity of the various classes of nucleosides, need to be conducted in order to maximize the potential of developing a potent nucleoside for the treatment of bacterial infections. this review begins with an introduction to terms followed by discussions regarding the general background and relevance for developing novel antimicrobial agents. challenges facing the antimicrobial drug discovery process are discussed along with relevant drug targets. an overview of nucleoside chemistry as it relates to antimicrobial activity is presented, followed by a discussion of the evidence which supports the potential of this class of compounds to yield the novel antimicrobial therapies needed in the new millennium.
pharmacological screening of six amaryllidaceae species.
dichloromethane and 90% methanol extracts of different parts of 6 amaryllidaceae  species were investigated for anti-inflammatory (cox-1 and cox-2), antibacterial and mutagenic (salmonella/microsome test strain ta98) activities. antibacterial activity was carried out using disc diffusion assay against three gram-positive (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and microccus luteus) and two gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. with the exception of the leaf of cyrtanthus mackenii, all ch(2)cl(2) extracts of different parts of cyrtanthus species inhibited the growth of at least one bacterium, with the ch(2)cl(2) bulb/root extracts of cyrtanthus suaveolens showing broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. in the anti-inflammatory assay, ch(2)cl(2) extracts, resuspended at 500 microg/ml, from different parts of all species under investigation, inhibited activity of both cox-1 and cox-2 by at least 70%. the most active, 90% methanolic extracts (resuspended at 500 microg/ml) were from the leaves (78%) and roots (76%) of cyrtanthus falcatus and the leaves of gethyllis ciliaris (70%). only ch(2)cl(2) extracts of cyrtanthus falcatus (leaf and root) and cyrtanthus suaveolens (bulb/root and leaf) had a mutagenic effect in the salmonella/microsome assay strain ta98.
susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
the aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. we created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 january, 1990 through 31 december, 2000). improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. during the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). the mean annual number of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). the 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: escherichia coli (1494), staphylococcus aureus (1240), klebsiella pneumoniae (779), enterococcus spp. (631), pseudomonas aeruginosa (488), streptococcus pneumoniae (447), enterobacter spp. (338), acinetobacter spp. (298), proteus mirabilis (260) and candida spp. (254). no significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations) per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was e. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was candida (1, 0.3). forty percent of organisms (n=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ed), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (icus). trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ed enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the icu isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. the difference in susceptibility between ed and icu isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the susceptibility of e coli to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. in k. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of k. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. susceptibility of s. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (p<0.001). marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.
antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1h-benzimidazoles and their feiii, cuii, znii, and agi complexes.
2-(2-pyridinyl)- (li), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (lii), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(liii), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (liv), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1h-benzimidazoles (lv) and their complexes with fe(no3)3, cu(no3)2, zn(no3)2, and agno3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans. the methyl groups of liii increase the antimicrobial activity. the agi complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. some znii complexes show an antimicrobial effect against s. aureus and s. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. cuii complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to s. aureus and s. epidermidis.
the biological activity of antibacterial substance produced by enterobacter cloacae b8.
an antibacterial substance was extracted and purified from the culture of enterobacter cloacae b8 and the antagonistic activities of the extract to 229 clinical pathogen strains was tested by the k-b paper-dish method. the extract of enterobacter cloacae b8 showed strongly antagonistic activity to all 146 tested stains of staphylococcus spp.; the antagonistic diameter was about 18-32 mm, averaging about 26.5 mm; showing especially strong antagonistic activity to all 87 tested strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the average antagonistic diameter was about 22.6 mm. the average antagonistic diameter of the extract of enterobacter cloacae b8 to 3 tested strains of escherchia coli and 8 tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae was about 14 mm and 13 mm, respectively; showing only antagonistic activities to 3 strains of acinetobacter spp. in 26 tested strains, and showing no antagonistic activities to all 25 tested strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of partially purified extract against mrsa was about 9.4 micrograms/ml determined by disc-diffusion method, and the mic of vancomycin was about 3.1 micrograms/ml as the control in this study.
investigation of antibiotic and antibacterial agent cross-resistance in target bacteria from homes of antibacterial product users and nonusers.
aim: to describe the relationship between antibiotic and antibacterial resistance in environmental and clinical bacteria from home environments across geographical locations, relative to the use or nonuse of antibacterial products, with a focus on target organisms recognized as potential human pathogens. methods and results: in a randomized study, environmental and clinical samples were collected from the homes of antibacterial product users (n=30) and nonusers (n=30) for the isolation of target bacteria for antibiotic and antibacterial testing in three geographical areas (in usa and uk). isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility, with selected antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible isolates tested against four common antibacterial agents (triclosan, para-chloro-meta-xylenol, pine oil and quaternary ammonium compound). prequalified users and nonusers at each location were randomly selected after meeting exclusionary criteria. of 1238 isolates, more target bacteria were recovered from nonuser than user homes. of staphylococcus aureus isolates (n=33), none showed resistance to oxacillin or vancomycin; for enterococcus sp. (n=149), none were resistant to ampicillin or vancomycin; and for klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54)and escherichia coli (n=24), none were resistant to third generation cephalosporins. antibiotic resistance to one or more of the standard test panel drugs for gram-positive and gram-negative target bacteria was comparable between nonuser and user homes for both environmental and clinical isolates [e.g. resistance of environmental coagulase-negative (cn) staphylococcus sp. was 73.8% (124/168) from nonuser homes and 73.0% (111/152) from user homes, and enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli, 75.9% (186/245) from nonuser homes compared with 78.0% from user homes]. of 524 gram-negatives tested against preferred/alternative drugs, 97.1% (509/524) were susceptible to all antibiotics, across both groups. isolates of s. aureus, enterococcus sp. and cn staphylococcus sp. susceptible to all preferred treatment drugs showed comparable antibacterial minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) results between nonuser and user home isolates. for gram-positives resistant to one or more preferred drugs, greatest resistance to antibacterial active ingredients was found in the nonuser group. for gram-negatives, the antibacterial mic data were comparable for isolates that were fully susceptible and resistant to one or more preferred/alternative treatment antibiotics. conclusions: the results showed a lack of antibiotic and antibacterial agent cross-resistance in target bacteria from the homes of antibacterial product users and nonusers, as well as increased prevalence of potential pathogens in nonuser homes. significance and impact of the study: it refutes widely publicized, yet unsupported, hypotheses that use of antibacterial products facilitates the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria from the home environment.
in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
restoration of antibacterial activity of beta-lactams by epigallocatechin gallate against beta-lactamase-producing species depending on location of beta-lactamase.
the combined effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (egcg) and beta-lactams were investigated against various beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates, including 21 staphylococcus aureus, 6 escherichia coli, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae and 8 serratia marcescens strains. penicillin in combination with egcg at 12.5 microg ml(-1) showed the most potent synergy against 100% penicillinase-producing s. aureus. however, cefotaxime or imipenem in combination with higher concentration of egcg (100 microg ml(-1)) only showed slight synergy against 2 of 17 gram-negative rods. similar to the effect on the penicillinase from s. aureus, however, egcg also directly inhibited the extracted beta-lactamases from the gram-negative rods, thereby protecting beta-lactams from inactivation. the different effects of the combinations on different beta-lactamase-producing species were confirmed to be related to the cellular locations of beta-lactamases. in contrast to a 32.7% extracellular fraction of total beta-lactamase activity in a penicillinase-producing s. aureus, the fractions were 0.6%, 0.6% and 1.2% in a tem-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, an inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae and an imp-producing s. marcescens, respectively. in conclusion, the combination of penicillin with egcg showed potent synergy against penicillinase-producing s. aureus in-vitro. the combinations of beta-lactams and egcg against beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative rods do indicate a limitation owing to the cellular location of beta-lactamases.
[bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1999 and march 2000].
the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. in this paper, the results obtained in the academic year 1999 (from april 1999 to march 2000) have been summarized. two hundred seven cases were investigated, and 411 strains were isolated from 169 cases (81.6%). of those strains, 184 and 227 strains were from primary infections and postoperative infections, respectively. in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes, streptococcus spp., and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes were higher than in primary infections. staphylococcus aureus were most frequently isolated among gram-positive aerobes, peptostreptococcus prevotii among gram-positive anaerobes, e. coli among gram-negative aerobes, and bacteroides fragilis among gram-negative anaerobes. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes, which gradually increased by the year 1998, decreased in the year 1999. the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes increased, while that of gram-negative bacteria was equivalent to that in the last year. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes, which continuously increased after the year 1990, decreased, while that of gram-positive aerobes, which decreased in the last year, increased. methicillin-resistant s. aureus accounted for 70.7% of s. aureus (41 strains). either the number of strain or the percentage of mrsa decreased. the susceptibilities of e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased against third and forth generation cephems, oxacephems, and monobactams. the susceptibilities of p. aeruginosa to carbapenems tend to decrease after the year 1997. s. aureus showed good susceptibilities to the tested drugs including arbekacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.
[pathogen variance and drug-sensibility analysis of lower-respiratory-tract bacterial infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease].
we contrastively analyzed pathogens and their drug sensibilities of lower-respiratory-tract infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease in two different periods. the results were that the gram-positive cocci (gpc) was 43.8% and gram-negative bacilli (gnb) was 56.2% in group a (1985-1990); gpc was 24.6% and gnb was 75.4% in group b (1995-2000). the predominant bacteria were in the following order: preudomonas (21.9%), pneumococcal (18.8%), streptococcus (10.9%), acinetobacter (9.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), and klebsiella (7.8%) in group a; and preudomonas (30.7%), acinetobacter (12.3%), staphylococcus epidermidis (12.3%), klebsiella (10.5%), enteric bacilli (7.0%), and staphylococcus aureus (7.0%) in group b. the results suggest that gnb is the main pathogen in recent years; sensibility of most drugs in the 1990s fell in varying degrees compared with that in the 1980s, but antibacterial in common use is still available.
antimicrobial activity of feiii, cuii, agi, znii and hgii complexes of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-bromo/nitro-phenyl)-1h- and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl/chloro/nitro-1h-benzimidazoles.
antimicrobial activity of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-r5-1h-benzimidazoles, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-r5'-phenyl)-1h-benzimidazoles and their feiii, cuii, agi, znii and hgii nitrate complexes was tested toward staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, and proteus mirabilis. antifungal activity was tested against candida albicans. benzimidazole benzene ring substituents increase the antimicrobial activity, phenol ring substituents decrease it. the ligands show an antibacterial effect against only s. aureus whereas agi and hgii complexes of the ligands have a higher activity with respect to the other complexes to all the bacteria. on the other hand, feiii complexes show a considerable activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis.
design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of beta-lactam-based prodrugs.
by use of pro-dual-drug concept the synthesis of 6-beta-[(r)-2-(clavaminio-9-n-yl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenylacetamido)]penicillanic acid (10), 6-beta-[(r)-2-(amino)-2-(4-(clavulano-9-o-yl)phenylacetamido)]penicillanic acid (13), (z)-4-[2-(amoxycillin-4-o-yl)ethylidene]-2-(clavulano-9-o-yl)-3-methoxy-delta(alp ha,beta)-butenolide (19), and 3-[(amoxicillin-4-o-yl)methyl]-7-(phenoxyacetamido)-(1-oxo)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (23) was accomplished. unlike penicillin g, ampicillin, or amoxicillin, these four heretofore undescribed compounds 10, 13, 19, and 23 showed notable activity against beta-lactamase (betal) producing microorganisms, staphylococcus aureus a9606, s. aureus a15091, s. aureus a20309, s. aureus 95, escherichia coli a9675, e. coli a21223, e. coli 27c7, pseudomonas aeruginosa 18s-h, and klebsiella pneumoniae a20634 tem. in comparison with amoxicillin (9), alpha-amino-substituted compound 10 and butenolide derivative 19 showed a broadened spectrum of antibacterial activity; yet they were found to be less active than 13 and 23. like clavulanic acid (7) or cephalosporin-1-oxide (21), the newly synthesized compounds 10, 13, 15, 16, 19, or 23 functioned as potent inhibitors of various bacterial betals.
isolation of antibacterial fatty acids from schotia brachypetala.
in southern africa, the roots of schotia brachypetala are used by traditional healers to treat dysentery and diarrhoea. activity-directed fractionation of the ethanol extract of the dried leaves yielded 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic (linolenic) acid and methyl-5,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoate. these fatty acids displayed antibacterial activity against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus and to a lesser extent, against the gram-negative escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.
[studies on pyridonecarboxylic acids as antibacterial agents. xiv. synthesis and  structure-activity relationships of 7,8-disubstituted-1-cyclopropyl-6-methyl-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinoline carboxylic acids].
eighteen pyridonecarboxylic acids, characterized by a methyl group at the c6-position instead of the usual fluorine atom, cyclopropyl at the n1-position, substituted amino groups at the c7-position, and some substituted groups (hydrogen, chlorine, nitro and amino) at the c8-position, were synthesized. the in vitro antibacterial activity of these compounds were tested, and the structure-activity relationships were also discussed. the results of the study showed that the activity of compounds 22 and 24 were less potent than that of ciprofloxacin against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, while they were 2-100 times more potent than ciprofloxacin against k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, a. calcoacetous, e. aerogenes, s. typhi and s. typhimurium.
synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some 2-[[alpha-(4-substituted benzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
in this study, a new series of 1-[[alpha-(4-substitutedbenzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were obtained by condensation of 2-[(alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl or alpha-bromopropionyl)amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazoles with sodium salts of 4-substituted benzoic acids. structures of the compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral data (uv, ir, 1h nmr, el ms) and elemental analyses. the antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538. staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans atcc 10231 were tested using disk diffusion method. compounds 4a, 4d and 4g were found to be active against s. aureus atcc 6538 (mic, 78, 39 and 78 microg ml(-1), respectively) and compound 4e against s. epidermidis atcc 12228 (mic, 156 microg ml(-1)).
present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.
in vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium were determined. the minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae. the antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). the clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. one strain of haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy. adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. in one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45 &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
the effect of an antimicrobial formulary change on hospital resistance patterns.
a university hospital formulary change that was designed to reduce the use of the third-generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefotaxime and replace them with the so-called "fourth-generation" cephalosporin cefepime was evaluated. a retrospective review of antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance during two 6-month periods before and after the formulary change was performed. all hospital patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), ceftazidime-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (crkp), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), piperacillin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (prpa), and ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa (crpa) infections were included in the study ceftazidime use decreased from 9600 g to 99 g, and cefotaxime use decreased from 6314 g to 732 g, which represented a combined decrease of 89%. use of cefepime increased from 0 g to 5396 g. infections from crkp decreased from 13% to 3%, prpa infections decreased from 22% to 14%, and crpa infections decreased from 25% to 15% (p<0.05 for all). infections from mrsa dropped insignificantly, and vre infections increased significantly. substituting cefepime for ceftazidime and cefotaxime while reducing the overall use of cephalosporins appears to decrease rates of crkp, prpa, and crpa.
in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of gar-936 tested against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive blood stream infection isolates and strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
gar-936, a new, semisynthetic glycylcycline, has shown good antibacterial activity against a wide range of clinically important gram-positive and -negative aerobic bacteria including streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, most enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. the purpose of this study was to determine the activity of gar-936 against a range of gram-positive and -negative bloodstream isolates including many strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). six hundred four bloodstream isolates of gram-positive cocci collected as part of the sentry surveillance program were selected for their geographic diversity. gar-936 was also tested against an additional 176 gram-negative cocci isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae, 98 strains; escherichia coli, 78 strains), 96 of which were esbl-producers. broth microdilution testing was used to determine the susceptibility of the selected organisms and a range of comparator antimicrobial agents whose choice was based on their activities against the selected pathogens and included a mix of both newer and older agents. presence of an esbl-producing strain was confirmed using the clavulanate test. gar-936 demonstrated impressive activity against all 604 strains of gram-positive cocci, with an mic range of <or=0.015-1 microg/ml, and mic(90)s ranging from <or=0.05 microg/ml for s. pneumoniae to 0.25 for s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. mics against the 176 gram-negative isolates were higher (range 0.06-4 microg/ml), with mic(90)s of 0.25-1 microg/ml. the activity of gar-936 was relatively unaffected by the presence of esbls. the activity of gar-936 was particularly impressive against gram-positive cocci when compared against the test results for vancomycin and the newer antimicrobial agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. the mic(90)s for gar-936 were significantly lower than the comparator agents for all species tested with particularly impressive results against s. pneumoniae and enterococci.
antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.
antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from cinnamomum osmophloeum.
the antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (a and b) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. the nine strains of bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella sp., and vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon b leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. the mics (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the b leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both k. pneumoniae and salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. the mics of cinnamaldehyde against the e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, mrsa, k. pneumoniae, salmonella sp., and v. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that c. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.
synthesis and antimicrobial properties of n-substituted derivatives of (e)-4-azachalcones.
syntheses of 11 new n-bromoalkyl substituted bromides of (e)-4-azachalcone and n-o-(m- and p-) halobenzyl substituted halides of (e)-3'-hydroxy-4-azachalcone of antimicrobial activity are reported. compounds 3d, 3e, 6b, 6c, and 6e reveal good antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis as well as moderate activity against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.
activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
synthesis of mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
5-phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. the structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (ir, 1h-nmr, eims) methods. the antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans atcc 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against s. aureus atcc 6538 (mic: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/ml respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against s. flexneri (mic: both 312.5 micrograms/ml). the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
[diagnostic value of a novel nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of pathogens causing enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis].
a new nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of the causative agents of enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis was found to have advantages over endo medium in its differentiating and inhibiting properties. this medium permitted the easy differentiation of yersinia pseudotuberculosis from y. enterocolitica, as well as from escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. rhinoscleromatis, hafnia, enterobacter and citrobacter by color; from proteus inconstans by swarming. in addition, weakly swarming of p. vulgaris differed by their light bluish color and pseudomonas aeruginosa, by the brilliance and size of colonies. endo medium could be used only for differentiation of e. coli from lactose-negative yersinia colonies, klebsiella (by mucous growth) and, to a certain extent, all proteus species (by swarming). the medium under test and the control medium inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus. in contrast to endo medium, the medium under test partially inhibited the growth of k. rhinoscleromatis and the swarming of p. inconstans. the new medium is now introduced into practice.
antimicrobial activity of extracts of eastern north american hardwood trees and relation to traditional medicine.
wood and bark extracts of 14 eastern north american hardwood tree species which were used traditionally as medicine by first nation's people were screened for antimicrobial activities with eight strains of bacteria and six strains of fungi. eighty-six percent of the bark extracts were active against methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus; 71% against bacillus subtilus and 79% against mycobacterium phlei. the bark extract of juglans cinerea was active against pseudomonas aeruginosa 187, salmonella typhiumurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the wood extracts were less active: 72% were active against s. aureus (methicillin-sensitive), 36% against b. subtilus and 43% against m. phlei. results from antifungal tests indicated that 36% of the extracts were active against at least one fungal strain and that bark extracts were more active than wood extracts. the bark extract from juglans cinerea had the broadest spectrum of activities against candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae, cryptococcus neoformans, trichophyton mentagrophytes, microsporum gypseum, and aspergillus fumigatus. in general, the extracts were more active against gram positive bacteria than gram negative bacteria and against filamentous fungi than yeast-like fungi. the study also demonstrated a correlation between frequency of traditional medicinal use by the first nations people and antimicrobial activity of extracts indicating that the traditional knowledge encompasses an understanding of aspects of chemical ecology.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(alpha-haloacyl)amino] thiazoles and 5-nonsubstituted/substituted 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones.
4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (i-iv) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. furthermore, i-iv were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (v-viii). v was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (ix-xiv). the structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, uv, ir, 1h-nmr and ei mass spectral data. the antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using mueller-hinton broth and mueller-hinton agar. in this study, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans atcc 10231 were used as test microorganisms. among the tested compounds, xi and xiv showed activity against s. aureus (mic: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound v had an activity against s. flexneri (mic: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound i against c. albicans (mic: 125 (micrograms/ml). compounds i, iv-xiv were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv using the bactec 460 radiometric system and bactec 12b medium. only compounds i and xiv showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1998)].
the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 18 institutions around the entire japan, 532 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 438 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1998 to september in 1999. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 85 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 96 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 75 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 6 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 38 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 26 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of 517 strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 60.0%. vancomycin (vcm) and arbekacin (abk) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. but one of mrsa showed resistance to abk with the mic of 64 micrograms/ml. the sensitive strains of mrsa to vcm have decreased. the frequency of penicillin (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) + pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) have increased in 46.0% for 1998 comparatively from 30.9% of 1997's. but prsp decreased, and pisp increased into 39.0% of 1998 years from 19.8% of 1997's. panipenem (papm), imipenem (ipm) and faropenem (frpm) showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. against h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis, almost all the drugs showed good activities. the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) decreased in 1997, but those have increased in 1998. inversely, the susceptibility of them against cefotiam (ctm) had been higher in 1997, but those have been lower in 1998. tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and nonmucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were active against k. pneumoniae. a quite few of k. pneumoniae showed low susceptibilities. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 48.6% of all the patients showing a slight increase in every year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases as follows: bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent with 40.2%. the ratio of it has increased slightly, and the increased rate was 10% in patients with ages over 70 years compared with the results in 1997. chronic bronchitis have decreased slightly with 27.6% in 1998. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these were almost same number in bacterial pneumonia. administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 26.7%, h. influenzae 23.8%, s. aureus 13.3% and m. (b.) catarrhalis 10.8%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 45.5% after administration over 15 days. the frequencies of s. pneumoniae decreased upon administration of antibiotics, these were only 4.5% over 15 days. the frequencies of h.

antimicrobial activity of essential oils and ethanol extract of phlomis fruticosa l. (lamiaceae).
the essential oils and an ethanol extract of phlomis fruticosa l. were evaluated  for antibacterial and antifungal activities. seven bacterial and seven fungal species were used. among them were human, animal and plant pathogens, food poisoning bacteria and fungi which are known as potential mycotoxin producers. the essential oils showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and micrococcus luteus. the essential oils extracted from the plants collected from two different localities showed similar antibacterial activities. the antifungal activity of the essential oils was positive against aspergillus niger, a. ochraceus, cladosporium cladosporioides, fusarium tricinctum and phomopsis helianthi. the ethanol extract showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis and antifungal activity against aspergillus niger, a. ochraceus, cladosporium cladosporioides, fusarium tricinctum and phomopsis helianthi.
effects of subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin in an in-vitro dynamic model.
the postantibiotic effect (pae), sub-mic effect (sme) and postantibiotic sub-mic  effect (pasme) of moxifloxacin were investigated in an in-vitro dynamic model reproducing in-vivo elimination kinetics of the antibiotic. the pae was induced by exposing strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae to 5 x mic of the antibiotic for 1.5 hours. after induction, cultures were washed to eliminate the antibiotic and resuspended into the dynamic model either in the presence or absence of a subinhibitory concentration of the antibacterial agent of 0.5 x mic. unexposed controls were treated similarly. pasmes were constantly longer than corresponding smes, but differences between them were not statistically significant. both pasmes (mean 11:17 hours, range from 8:17 to 14:57) and smes (mean 9:23 hours, range from 6:03 to 12:34) had an initial bactericidal effect and were significantly longer than paes (mean 1:31 hours, range from 0:21 to 2:14). the primary effect of moxifloxacin sub-mics appears to be prevalent in pae. the possibility of once-daily dosing of the drug is strengthened.
comparative pharmacodynamics of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin in an in vitro dynamic model: prediction of equiefficient doses and the breakpoints of the area under the curve/mic ratio.
to demonstrate the impact of the pharmacokinetics of gatifloxacin (ga) relative to those of ciprofloxacin (ci) on the antimicrobial effect (ame), the killing and regrowth kinetics of two differentially susceptible clinical isolates each of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae were studied. with each organism, a series of monoexponential pharmacokinetic profiles of ga (half-life [t(1/2)], 7 h) and ci (t(1/2) = 4 h) were simulated to mimic different single doses of ga and two 12-h doses of ci. the respective eightfold ranges of the ratios of the area under the concentration-time curve (auc) to the mic were 58 to 466 and 116 to 932 (microg. h/ml)/(microg/ml). the species- and strain-independent linear relationships observed between the intensity of ame (i(e)) and log auc/mic were not superimposed for ga and ci (r(2) = 0.99 in both cases). the predicted auc/mic ratio for ga that might be equivalent to a clinically relevant auc/mic breakpoint for ci was estimated to be 102 rather than 125 (microg. h/ml)/(microg/ml). the respective mic breakpoints were 0.32 microg/ml (for a 400-mg dose of ga) and 0.18 microg/ml (for two 500-mg doses of ci). on the basis of the i(e)-log auc/mic relationships, equiefficient 24-h doses (d(24h)s) of ga and ci were calculated for hypothetical strains of s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae for which the mics were equal to the mics at which 50% of isolates are inhibited. to provide an "acceptable" i(e) equal to 200 (log cfu/ml). h, i.e., the i(e) provided by auc/mic of 125 (microg. h/ml)/(microg/ml) for ciprofloxacin, the d(24h)s of ga for all three organisms were much lower (115, 30, and 60 mg) than the clinically proposed 400-mg dose. although the usual dose of ci (two doses of 500 mg) would be in excess for e. coli and k. pneumoniae (d(24h) = two doses of 40 mg and two doses of 115 mg, respectively), even the highest clinical dose of ci (two doses of 750 mg) might be insufficient for s. aureus (d(24h), > two doses of 1,000 mg). the method of generalization of data obtained with specific organisms to other representatives of the same species described in the present report might be useful for prediction of the ames of new quinolones.
[in vitro activities of carbapenem antibiotics against the various clinical isolates].
the annual changes of antibacterial activities of beta-lactam antibiotics, mainly carbapenem antibiotics, were investigated against 5 bacterial species, s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had been isolated from the clinical materials at toho university omori hospital during the period of 1995 to 1997. in addition, antibacterial activities against other main bacterial strains isolated from the clinical materials during 1997 were also determined. the five bacterial species on which annual changes of the sensitivity were investigated did not show any remarkable trend to increase in resistance to the carbapenem antibiotics tested. the antibacterial activities of the carbapenem antibiotics against mrsa were weak, and mic90 values were between 25 and 50 micrograms/ml. in s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa on which high resistance by the production of metallo-beta-lactamase has become a problem in recent years, there were no remarkable changes in annual changes of sensitivities. especially, mic90 valuses of the carbapenem antibiotics against p. aeruginosa were between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, 4 to 8 times better than that of pipc, like the case of caz. furthermore, the carbapenem antibiotics showed strong antibacterial activities against clinically important 16 bacterial species, from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria.
in-vitro activity of cefepime and other broad-spectrum antimicrobials against several groups of gram-negative bacilli and staphylococcus aureus.
the in vitro activity of cefepime was compared with that of amikacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam by using the e-test against five groups of carefully selected organisms: klebsiella pneumoniae (68 isololates), pseudomonas aeruginosa (62), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (60), and two groups of enterobacteriaceae (60 and 62 isolates, respectively). the bacteria were subdivided according to whether the infection was nosocomial or community-acquired, applying accepted and predefined criteria. these isolates were obtained from patients admitted to our medical center throughout 1998. we retrospectively compared antimicrobial susceptibilities of the study sample with those of the +/- 3000 bacterial strains isolated from blood stream infections since 1990: the study sample appeared to represent adequately the clinical databank. presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) was determined in all groups of enterobacteriaceae with the esbl screening e-test strip. of the 252 gram-negative bacilli tested, 242 (96%) were susceptible to cefepime, whereas only 168 (67%) were susceptible to ceftazidime, 211 (84%) to amikacin, and 220 (87%) to piperacillin-tazobactam (p < 0.001). imipenem was slightly superior to cefepime with only seven isolates resistant (3%), six of which were p. aeruginosa. cefepime was more active against enterobacteriaceae than ceftazidime (93% vs. 72%, p < 0.001). this superiority was most evident against nosocomial strains of k. pneumoniae, against which cefepime was > three times more active than ceftazidime. the high level of resistance seen in nosocomial isolates of k. pneumoniae is consistent with high rates of esbl production (69%, compared with 15-26% in other enterobacteriaceae). the mic90 of cefepime to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus was 1.5 micrograms/ml, whereas that of ceftazidime was 4 micrograms/ml; the susceptibility rate of both was 100%. in conclusion, cefepime possesses in vitro potencies against mssa and current clinical strains of gram-negative bacilli, many of which harbor resistance to other antimicrobial agents. hence, it seems very suitable for empiric coverage of serious nosocomial infections.
antimicrobial activities of several parts of pinus brutia, juniperus oxycedrus, abies cilicia, cedrus libani and pinus nigra.
in this study, the antimicrobial activities of several parts of various trees grown in the kahramanmaras region of turkey were investigated by the disc diffusion method. chloroform, acetone and methanol extracts of leaves, resins, barks, cones and fruits of pinus brutia ten., juniperus oxycedrus l., abies cilicia ant. & kotschy carr., cedrus libani a. rich. and pinus nigra arn. were prepared and tested against bacillus megaterium dsm 32, bacillus subtilis img 22, bacillus cereus fmc 19, escherichia coli dm, klebsiella pneumoniae fmc 3, enterobacter aerogenes ccm 2531, staphylococcus aureus cowan 1, mycobacterium smegmatis rut, proteus vulgaris fmc 1, listeria monocytogenes scoot a, pseudomonas aeruginosa dsm 5007, candida albicans ccm 314, candida tropicalis mdc 86 and penicillium italicum k. the results showed that antifungal effects were not observed for the whole extracts, e. coli was not inhibited by any of the plant extracts except by the chloroform and acetone extracts of the leaves of a. cilicia, which showed inhibition zones of 16-18 mm, respectively. all the plant extracts used in this study inhibited the development of the other bacteria studied. when the results of this study were compared with an ampicillin standard, it was found that the microorganisms studied were generally susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the extracts of species when compared with the ampicillin standard. on the other hand, the acetone and methanol extracts of juniperus fruits were found to be quite resistant.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1997)].
the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 17 institutions around the entire japan, 512 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 440 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1997 to september in 1998. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 100 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 81 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 85 strains of haemophilus influenzae. 71 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 27 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 33 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 55.0%. the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 67.3%. arbekacin (abk) and vancomycin (vcm) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml against s. pneumoniae. the frequency of penicillin (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp)+pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) had decreased gradually, that is, in 1995 the frequency of it was 40.3%, but that was 30.9% in 1997. against h. influenzae and m.(b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities. but the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) had decreased in 1997, compared those in 1995 and 1996. meropenem (mepm), ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). and tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were more active against k. pneumoniae in 1997 than that in 1996. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 45.5% of all the patients showing a slight increase year by year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases, not so particular changes were recognized as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 33.6% and 29.1%, respectively. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these had reversed in bacterial pneumonia. the tendency in bacterial pneumonia had been acknowledged since 1995. the increase of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid strains) isolated after administration of antibiotics, has suggested the decrease of the susceptibility of these strains against antibiotics. administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 24.5%, h. influenzae 21.4%, s. aureus 18.4% and p. aeruginosa 12.2%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 47.8% after administration over 15 days. from patients administered antibiotics of penicillins and cephems. s. aureus was mainly detected with 31.7-58.3%, and from patients administere
prediction of the antimicrobial effects of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin on staphylococci using an in-vitro dynamic model.
to compare the pharmacodynamics of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin, three clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus with different mics (0.03, 0.15, 0.6 and 0.1, 0.25, 1.25 mg/l, respectively) were exposed to decreasing concentrations of the quinolones according to their half-lives of 9.25 and 4 h, respectively. with each organism, single doses of trovafloxacin and twice-daily doses of ciprofloxacin were designed to provide 8-fold ranges of the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve (auc) to the mic, 58-466 and 116-932 (mg x h/l)/(mg/l), respectively. the antimicrobial effect was expressed by its intensity: the area between the control growth in the absence of antibiotics and the antibiotic-induced time-kill/regrowth curves (i(e)). linear relationships established between i(e) and log auc/mic were bacterial strain-independent but specific for the quinolones (r2 = 0.99 in both cases). at a given auc/mic ratio, the i(e)s of trovafloxacin were greater than those of ciprofloxacin, suggesting that the antimicrobial effect of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin against staphylococci may be even greater than might be expected from the difference in their mics. these data were combined with previous results obtained with three gram-negative bacteria. again, i(e) correlated well with the log auc/mic of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin in a strain- and species-independent fashion (r2 = 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). on this basis, a value of the auc/mic of trovafloxacin which might be equivalent to schentag's auc/mic = 125 (mg x h/l)/(mg/l) reported as the breakpoint value for ciprofloxacin was estimated at 71 (mg x h/l)/(mg/l) with the respective mic breakpoint of 0.27 mg/l. based on the i(e)-log auc/mic relationships, the i(e)s were plotted against the logarithm of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin dose (d) for hypothetical representatives of s. aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa with mics corresponding to the mic50s. these i(e)-log d relationships allow prediction of the effect of a given quinolone on a representative strain of the bacterial species.
[evaluation of a multi-hospital cooperative study on the efficacy and safety of panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) on elderly patients of respiratory infections].
the efficacy and safety of panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) on elderly patients of  respiratory infections was examined at 17 hospitals in a cooperative study. among the 95 case, we examined the efficacy of the medication in 86 cases, and the safety in all 95 cases. efficacy was confirmed in 81.3% of pneumonia patients, 57.7% of secondary-infection patients of chronic respiratory diseases, and 74.4% of the total. no significant difference was observed among each group according to age, comparing patients > or = 65 years old grouped by 5 years, or when broadly comparing groups < 75 years and > or = 75 years of age. the microbiological efficacy was 100% for streptococcus pneumoniae, 80% for staphylococcus aureus, 80% in klebsiella pneumoniae; therefore, a very good disappearance rate of symptoms could be obtained in all major respiratory etiologic agents except pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this study, we also examined other factors considered to affect the course of treatment for elderly patients of infectious diseases, namely the presence of absence of underlying diseases, the distinctness of infectious symptoms, the patient's condition before the appearance of infectious symptoms, and previous history of treatment with antimicrobial agents. for safety, the incidence rate of side effects was 14.7%, which was similar to the 16.9% in the developmental study. these two findings were also similar in content. no significant difference was observed among each age group, comparing patients > or = 65 years old grouped by 5 years, or comparing groups < 75 years and > or = 75 years of age. from the above evaluation, we consider papm/bp to be an effective drug for normal adult patients as well as elderly patients of respiratory infections.
bacterial pathogens (non-mycobacterium) from sputum culture and antimicrobial susceptibility.
sputum culture of patients at siriraj hospital, bangkok was 49.84% positive for bacterial pathogens in 1994 and 40.95% in 1995. the average incidence of gram-negative rods was 3.11 fold more than the combination of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci. the most common gram-negative rod was pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by either klebsiella pneumoniae or acinetobacter anitratus depending on year. the most common coccus was staphylococcus aureus. from both years, the number of haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and nocardia spp isolated were 122, 93, 13 and 11 strains respectively. for antimicrobial susceptibility, p. aeruginosa was sensitive to ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, netilmicin, ciprofloxacin (range 56-89%). s. aureus (mssa) was sensitive to common used drugs. s. aureus (mrsa) was sensitive to co-trimoxazole, fosfomycin, vancomycin (range 57-100%) and resistant to most drugs.
toxicity of hydrogen peroxide produced by electroplated coatings to pathogenic bacteria.
the ability of various electroplated coatings (cobalt, zinc, copper, and cobalt-containing alloys of nickel, zinc, chromium, etc.) to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria (gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) was determined by a drop-method antibacterial experiment. the amounts of h2o2 produced and metal ions dissolved from the surfaces of various electroplated coatings were measured and it was found that the inhibitory ability of coatings corresponded to the amounts of h2o2 produced. the more significant the inhibition of the coating to bacterial growth, the greater the amount of h2o2 production. in addition, the bacterial survival rates on the surfaces of coatings were almost zero when h2o2 was produced in amounts greater than 10(-6) mmol/cm2. however, the dominant concentrations of metal ions dissolved from coatings were outside of the bacterial lethal range.
bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
the sentry program was established in january 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the united states (30 sites), canada (8 sites), south america (10 sites), and europe (24 sites). during the first 6-month study period (january to june 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (bsi) were reported by north american sentry participants (4,119 from the united states and 939 from canada). in both the united states and canada, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common bsi isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10 most frequently reported species in both the united states and canada. although the rank orders of pathogens in the united states and canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several pathogens. overall, u.s. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from canada. the differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (meca, vana, and vanb) in the canadian microbial population. among u.s. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.
antibacterial activity of peritoneal exudate in patients treated with 2 g cefotiam for surgical anti-microbial prophylaxis.
the objective of this study was to investigate the presence of antibacterial activity in peritoneal exudate (pe) of patients treated with cefotiam (cft). cft (2 g) was administered as a 'single-shot' antimicrobial prophylaxis to 6 patients at the beginning of colorectal resection. samples of pe were collected from each patient on days 1, 2 and 3 after surgery. cft was detectable in the samples of day 1 for 5 of the 6 patients. the influence of pe on antibacterial activity of the antimicrobial drug was evaluated carrying out the mics of cft against escherichia coli k-12, e. coli (atcc 10798), klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc 1003), proteus rettgeri (sanelli) and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213) with and without the addition of pe. the presence of pe enhanced the antimicrobial activity of cft against gram-negative strains, but not against s. aureus (atcc 29213). these results suggest the presence of substances in pe that possess endogenous antibacterial activity. thus, antimicrobial activity in pe cannot be predicted by evaluating pathogen sensitivity in vitro only.
[in vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
a xanthanolide with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
this study was conducted to find constituents of an annual herb, xanthium sibiricum patr er widd, with effective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). by monitoring antibacterial activity against mrsa strains, it was shown that a sesquiterpene lactone, identified as [3ar-(3a alpha, 7 beta,8a beta)]-3,3a,4,7,8,8a-hexahydro-7- methyl-3-methylene-6-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-2h-cyclohepta[b]furan-2-one, or xanthatin, isolated from leaves of the herb, had outstandingly potent activity against s. aureus species, including mrsa; its activity against mrsa and mssa strains was similar. other bacteria, e.g. staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, were also susceptible at the concentrations tested but the compound had no inhibitory effect on some other bacteria, including escherichia coli. the results show that xanthatin has outstandingly potent activity against strains of s. aureus but that the activity of the compound is highly species-specific.
the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells (m. f. bernet, d. brassard, j. r. neeser, and a. l. servin, gut 35:483-489, 1994). here, we demonstrate that strain la1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected by salmonella typhimurium. we present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain la1 (la1-scs) contained antibacterial components active against s. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. by contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1995)].
the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 567 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 459 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october 1995 to september 1996. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 74 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 82 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 104 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 85 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 18 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 52 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 52.7%. arbekacin (abk) showed the most highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of 0.5 micrograms/ml. vancomycin (vcm) showed the next highest activity with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. these drugs showed the high activities against mrsa with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) s. pneumoniae. most of drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm), carbapenems, showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefotaxime (ctx), cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefpirome (cpr) of cephems showed the next most potent activities with mic80s of 0.25 microgram/ml. erythromycin (em) and clindamycin (cldm) showed low activities with mic80s 128 micrograms/ml or high. among these strains, however, 48.8% and 65.9% of respective strains were quite toward sensitive these agents with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3) h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae test with all mics at 4 micrograms/ml or below. cefotiam (ctm), cmx, cefditoren (cdtr) and ofloxacin (oflx) showed the most potent activity with mic90s to 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) p. aeruginosa. (mucoid strains) ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. ceftazidime (caz), cefsulodin (cfs) and carumonam (crmn) showed next potent activity, with mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 32 micrograms/ml. 5) p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. the mic80 of ampicillin (abpc) was 128 micrograms/ml in 1994, it was 16 micrograms/ml in 1995. 6) k. pneumoniae. all drugs except abpc were active against k. pneumoniae. cpr and crmn showed the most potent activities against k. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.125 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) m. (b.) catarrhalis. against m. (b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities with mic80s at 4 micrograms/ml or below. and mics of all strains were 8 micrograms/ml or below. ipm, oflx and minocycline (mino) showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. patients' backgrounds were examine for 567 isolates from 459 cases. the examination of age distribution found that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 66.3% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. proportion of differe
antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.
antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime in vitro.
cefpodoxime proxetil is a new orally administered prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to release the third-generation cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, and which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method, we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and quinolones against 637 recent clinical isolates from kaohsiung veterans general hospital in taiwan. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, cefpodoxime showed excellent activity, inhibiting over 90% of these isolates at 1 mg/l. like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. against haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparative drugs. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefpodoxime showed moderate activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas it was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. however, all cephalosporins have shown little in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus regardless of in vitro results. cefpodoxime was inactive against enterococcus spp. against other streptococci, its activity was similar to other oral cephalosporins and quinolones tested. the results of this in vitro study indicated that oral administration of cefpodoxime should be an ideal agent in the empirical outpatient treatment for community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium smegmatis, and streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per ml. staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. for gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and xanthomonas maltophilia, mics were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. the microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. b. cereus and saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. however, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. the disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.
a multinational european survey on the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin and other  comparative antibiotics on respiratory and urinary bacterial pathogens.
the antibacterial activity of rufloxacin was confirmed against a large number of  respiratory and urinary tract pathogens collected in five european countries. in terms of both mic90 values and percentages of susceptible isolates found, this new quinolone showed useful in-vitro activity against mycoplasma catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, with a large proportion of staphylococcus aureus also covered, while, as expected streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were not included in its antibacterial spectrum. rufloxacin was comparable with the other antibiotics against these pathogens with the exception of streptococci. against these microorganisms, beta-lactams were the most active agents. against the urinary pathogens the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin is similar to that of norfloxacin although this latter drug is more active in terms of mic90 values and in percentages of strains inhibited. in many cases more isolates were susceptible to the remaining comparator agents than to rufloxacin. however, there were no significant differences between the numbers of microorganisms inhibited by the various drugs and rufloxacin. the findings of this survey do not seem to modify the general picture which emerged in previous studies and further confirms its useful spectrum in different geographic settings.
[determination of serum aminoglycoside and vancomycin concentrations by the microbiological method in the presence of other antimicrobials].
the determination of serum concentrations of antimicrobials with a narrow therapeutic range by microbiological method requires some modifications when the patient is under combined antimicrobial therapy. the methodological conditions for the appraisal of aminoglycosides and vancomycin in the presence of other drugs were evaluated by using strains with selective sensitivity to the antimicrobial to be tested or by the adding crude extracts of beta-lactamases for the inactivation of the beta-lactam antimicrobials. these beta-lactamases were obtained from enterobacter cloacae p99 (derepressed mutant) cultures for the inactivation of penicillins and first, second and third generation cephalosporins, as well as from stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia m 1484 cultures for the hydrolysis of imipenem. the strains allowing vancomycin appraisal and indifferent to the synergic activity of other drugs in the mixture were s. aureus m 2120, when the accompanying antimicrobials were gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, and e. faecalis m 2113, e. avium m 2091 and s. aureus m 2101 when the drugs in the mixture were amikacin, lincomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. for the appraisal of gentamicin in the presence of vancomycin or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), e. coli m 1376 was the most suitable strain, while the use of k. pneumoniae atcc 10031 was required for the appraisal of amikacin or netilmicin. when rifampicin was the accompanying antimicrobial, e. coli m 1495 turned out more adequate. e. coli m 1462 proved to be more satisfactory for gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin dosages in samples also containing chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1994)].
bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 492 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputum of 421 patients with lower respiratory tract infections from october 1994 to september 1995. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 70 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 101 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 92 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 61 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 25 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 48 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 14 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1. s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 51.4%, but the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 56.0%. vancomycin showed the highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. 2. s. pneumoniae. most of the drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem of carbapenems showed the most potent activity with mic80 was 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and clindamycin showed low activities with mic80s > or = 256 micrograms/ml. among these strains, however, 46.5% and 68.3% of strains, were quite sensitive toward these agents, respectively, with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae tested. cefmenoxime a cephem, showed the most potent activity, the mics of this drug against all of the 92 strains were 0.063 microgram/ml. ofloxacin also showed a potent activity, and inhibited about 96% of strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. gentamicin, arbekacin and ciprofloxacin showed next potent activities, and their mic80s were 2 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80 of 2 micrograms/ml. comparing to the activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains), the activities of all the drugs tested were lower against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). 6. k. pneumoniae. carumonam showed the most potent activity against k. pneumoniae with mic80 of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefozopran showed the next most potent activity with mic80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. ampicillin and cephems except cefpodoxime, cefozopran and cefditoren showed low activities and their mic80s were > or = 16 micrograms/ml, and their mics were all higher than > or = 4 micrograms/ml. 7. m. (b.) catarrhalis. imipenem and ofloxacin showed the most potent activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, their mic80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and minocycline showed the next highest activities with their mic80s at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, the respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology of bacteria. patients characteristics, in this period of investigation showed varieties of infectious diseases found in patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 62.0% of all the cases. different lower respiratory tract infectious were distributed as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest number of cases with 35.6%, 27.1%, respectively, followed by
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone.
the in vitro and in vivo activities of cs-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. the in vitro activity of cs-940 against gram-positive bacteria was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. in particular, cs-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the mic at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cs-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. the activity of cs-940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. cs-940 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by s. aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa, cs-940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains tested. against experimental pneumonia with k. pneumoniae in mice, cs-940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. these results suggest that cs-940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections.
bacterial changes in neonatal intensive care unit.
organisms routinely cultured from throat swabs and infectious agents of sepsis and/or meningitis were reviewed. during the last 12 years, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli have been replaced by staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa as the predominant isolates from throat swabs after admission. these change in the etiologic pattern of infectious agents of sepsis and/or meningitis, i.e., k. pneumoniae, e. coli, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis, were in agreement with the organisms isolated from the throat swabs after admission. the s. aureus isolated from throat swabs after admission showed a decrease in the bacterial activity of cloxacillin, cephazolin and cefotaxime since 1978.
antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the 1990s.
streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumoniae have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. this chapter reviews the epidemiology of this resistance, its detection in the laboratory, the mechanisms of resistance, and the options for therapy and infection control.
antibacterial activity of cefprozil in vitro.
cefprozil is a new orally active cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against 637 recent clinical isolates from the kaohsiung veterans general hospital, taiwan. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, cefprozil showed good activity, inhibiting over 80% of these isolates at 8 mg/l. like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. against haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefprozil showed high activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, its activity was higher than that of other oral cephalosporins tested and was similar to that of ciprofloxacin. of enterococci tested, 57.7% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefprozil. against beta-hemolytic streptococci, its activity was superior to all other drugs tested. the results of this in vitro study indicate that oral administration of cefprozil might be efficacious in the treatment of community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
[antimicrobial activity and interaction with dna of medicinal plants from the peruvian amazon region].
decoctions of four plants used for the treatment of different infections by indigenous groups of the peruvian amazon, i.e. abuta grandifolia, cyperus articulatus, gnaphalium spicatum and pothomorphe peltata were evaluated for antimicrobial activity by the "stroke method" in agar plates. tested organisms included staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella gallinarum, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium gordonae. all decoctions showed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the tested organisms. the a. grandifolia and c. articulatis decoctions partially inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa. s. aureus was completely inhibited by c. articulatus decoction and only partially inhibited by g. spicatum and p. peltata. the a. grandifolia decoction also showed a partial inhibition against m. gordonae, showing a clear correlation between the ethnopharmacological use and the observed activity. methanolic extracts of plants were analyzed by using the dna-methyl green bioassay. the methanolic extract of p. peltata (concentration 1000 micrograms/ml) showed a decrease of 30% regarding to the initial absorbance of the dna-mg complex suggesting the possible interaction with dna.
influence of pulmonary surfactant on in vitro bactericidal activities of amoxicillin, ceftazidime, and tobramycin.
the influence of a natural pulmonary surfactant on antibiotic activity was investigated to assess the possible use of exogenous surfactant as a vehicle for antibiotic delivery to the lung. the influence of surfactant on the bactericidal activity of amoxicillin was tested against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, and the influence of surfactant on the activities of ceftazidime and tobramycin was tested against klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. pneumoniae. in vitro antibiotic activity was determined by killing curve studies in media with and without surfactant. amoxicillin and ceftazidime activities were not changed in the presence of surfactant, except for a decreased killing rate of s. pneumoniae by ceftazidime in medium with additional rabbit serum. in contrast, killing curves with low concentrations of tobramycin (0.25x and 1x the mic) showed a decreased level of activity of tobramycin against all pathogens tested in the presence of surfactant. with higher tobramycin concentrations (4x the mic) killing rates were decreased less or were unchanged in the presence of surfactant. concluding from the results of the study, both amoxicillin and ceftazidime can be combined with surfactant without the loss of activity. for mixing surfactant with tobramycin, dosages should be adjusted to overcome the partial inactivation of tobramycin by surfactant.
trends in antimicrobial resistance among today's bacterial pathogens.
resistance of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem with significant clinical consequences. microbiologic surveillance data, such as those provided by the national nosocomial infections surveillance system, supply information on current nosocomial pathogens in the united states. many species show resistance to commonly used antimicrobials and, in many cases, it is emerging resistance. resistance in many gram-negative bacteria is caused by beta-lactamase production. escherichia coli, the leading nosocomial pathogen, is capable of hyperproducing tem-1 beta-lactamase. a novel form of resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli is caused by extended-spectrum cephalosporinases. many enterobacteriaceae can be induced to produce group 1 beta-lactamase by exposure to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and other beta-lactams. thirty percent of haemophilus influenzae isolates are resistant to ampicillin because of beta-lactamase production. issues of concern in gram-positive species include multiple antimicrobial resistance in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and increasing beta-lactam resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. to minimize the development of resistance, antimicrobials must be administered judiciously, and infection-control practices must be instituted and followed.
[fundamental and clinical studies of sy5555 in pediatrics].
we assessed the in vitro antimicrobial activity and the clinical efficacy and safety of sy5555 in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized below. 1. in vitro antibacterial activities of sy5555 against 52 clinical isolates were compared with those of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (cva/ampc), cefotiam (ctm), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefaclor (ccl) and cefdinir (cfdn). against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, sy5555 displayed antimicrobial activities superior or nearly equivalent to those of the reference agents used in the study. in cases of gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial activity of sy5555 against haemophilus influenzae was inferior to those of cpdx and cfdn. against klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of sy5555 was less potent than that of cpdx. 2. forty-seven children with infectious diseases were treated with sy5555 dry syrup (powder dissolved just before use). the clinical results were excellent in 24 and good in 16, with an efficacy rate of 85.1%. 3. bacteriological screening identified 30 pathogenic organisms, and the eradication rate was 76.7%. 4. side effects consisted of diarrhea in 12.5% (6 cases), loose stools in 4.2% (2 cases) and urticaria in 2.1% (1 case) of the patients. the only abnormal laboratory test value observed was an increase in eosinophil count in one child. 5. the palatability of sy5555 dry syrup was very good; it was very easily ingestable or easily ingestable by 32 of the 48 children. from the above results, sy5555 dry syrup appears to be a useful drug with a preferable safety profile in the treatment of pediatric patients with infectious diseases.
microbiology of controlled rotting of egusi (colocynthis citrullus l.) fruits for the harvesting of the seeds.
microorganisms isolated from naturally rotting egusi fruits which are used as a source of dietary seeds, were mainly bacteria: bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, b. polymyxa, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, lactobacillus plantarum, la. brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, micrococcus and candida spp. the rotting period of egusi fruits could be decreased from 120 to 72 h by using a mixture of b. subtilis and b. licheniformis.
evaluation of opc-17116 against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract  infections.
the antibacterial activity of opc-17116, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. the pharmacokinetic profiles of opc-17116 were studied in both mice and rats given the drug orally at doses of 50 and 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. opc-17116 showed a high degree of distribution in the lung tissues of both species, with maximum concentrations of 29.6 and 32.0 micrograms/g, respectively. furthermore, the drug concentrations in lung tissue were about 10 to 15 times greater than the concentrations in plasma. opc-17116 showed potent antibacterial activity against such pathogens as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. the mics of this compound for 90% of these organisms except methicillin-resistant s. aureus and p. aeruginosa ranged from < or = 0.006 to 0.78 microgram/ml. the in vitro antibacterial activity of opc-17116 was reflected by the efficacy of a single oral dose against systemic bacterial infections in mice. opc-17116 showed a superior effect against gram-positive bacteria, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis. in comparison with the other reference compounds, the efficacy of opc-17116 was less than that of ciprofloxacin against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa. opc-17116 showed a greater therapeutic effect than the other drugs against experimental acute pneumonia caused by these organisms in mice or rats. this excellent therapeutic effect against respiratory tract infections may be a result of its high level of distribution in lung tissue.
evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
the antibacterial activity of minocycline (mino) and that of cefuzonam (czon) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. mino was highly active against methicilli-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, flavobacterium meningosepticum, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, peptostreptococcus spp. and propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. czon was highly active against mssa, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, n. gonorrhoeae, m(b). catarrhalis, h. influenzae, h. pylori, p. mirabilis, peptostreptococcus spp. and p. acnes, but not effective against mrsa. it was minimally active against gram-negative rods (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
post-antibiotic effects of cefdinir on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyrogenes.
the post-antibiotic effects (paes) of a new cephalosporin, cefdinir, were determined against a range of organisms using a viable counting technique. cefdinir exerted considerable paes against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, but no overall post-antibiotic inhibition of growth was detected against escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae. exposure to cefdinir made the gram-negative organisms susceptible to the washing procedure used for drug removal, but this was followed by rapid recovery of viability in drug-free broth.
characterisation of an oxidative response inhibitor produced by streptococcus pneumoniae.
background: pneumonia caused by infection with streptococcus pneumoniae is still  a major clinical problem. reactive oxygen species contribute to the killing of these bacteria by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmns). defence mechanisms of str pneumoniae which counter reactive oxygen species are characterised. methods: pmns were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) in the presence and absence of str pneumoniae and supernatants from them, and superoxide (o2-) production was measured by the reduction of ferricytochrome c. results: streptococcus pneumoniae, but not klebsiella pneumoniae or staphylococcus aureus, inhibited pma stimulated superoxide production by pmns. washed pmns which had been preincubated with str pneumoniae autolysis phase supernatants also exhibited depressed h2o2 production in response to pma. the inhibitory activity was not attributable to non-specific cytotoxicity as assessed by release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, nor did the supernatants inhibit pma stimulated degranulation of pmns. fractionation of the autolysis phase supernatants revealed inhibitory activity in both the fractions greater than and less than 10 kd. like pneumolysin the inhibitory activity was heat sensitive. however, both a parent and pneumolysin negative mutant str pneumoniae, and autolysis phase supernatants from them, inhibited pmn superoxide production. antisera to pneumolysin failed to abrogate the inhibitory effect of intact str pneumoniae or autolysis phase supernatants from types 1 or 14 str pneumoniae. conclusions: the inhibitory effect of str pneumoniae on the respiratory burst of pmns is not shared by two other common lung pathogens. the existence of a novel inhibitor of the pmn respiratory burst, distinct from pneumolysin, has been demonstrated. the inhibitor is specific for the respiratory burst and is active both in the logarithmic phase of growth and during autolysis.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens. fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.
in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.
[in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates. beta-lactamase study group in chubu-area].
antimicrobial susceptibilities and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates from 1986 to 1991 except 1988 were determined. beta-lactamase was detected frequently in escherichia coli (84.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (65.4%), staphylococcus aureus (62.3%), and not frequently in haemophilus influenzae (22.4%). methicillin-resistant s. aureus was also resistant to many antimicrobials except to arbekacin and minocycline, and imipenem showed markedly high activity against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus. susceptibilities of e. coli and k. pneumoniae to cefuzonam, imipenem and ofloxacin were quite high and that of h. influenzae to ofloxacin and cefuzonam was also very high.
antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
serum bactericidal activity after administration of four cephalosporins in healthy volunteers.
serum bactericidal activity (sba) was determined against ten strains each of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter cloacae in six volunteers 1 h and 4 h after intravenous infusion of 1 g and 2 g cefotaxime and cefmenoxime, and 2 g flomoxef, and against ten strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa after infusion of 1 g and 2 g ceftazidime. flomoxef showed the highest sba against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. all cephalosporins had high sba against gram-negative rods. cefotaxime had the highest sba against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the sba against pseudomonas aeruginosa after 1 g and 2 g doses of ceftazidime was very similar.
the post-antibiotic effect of antimicrobial combinations in a neutropenic murine  thigh infection model.
the post-antibiotic effect (pae) may allow for more widely spaced dosing of antibiotics than is currently employed without loss of efficacy. antimicrobial combinations are widely used in clinical medicine. however, dosing schedules are usually based on pharmacological profiles of the drugs used alone. previously we have demonstrated significant prolongation of the pae induced by antimicrobial combinations in vitro as compared to paes induced by the agents alone. we examined this issue further in vivo in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model, by exposing staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae to several antimicrobials, either singly or in combination. the pae in vivo was defined as the difference in time needed for the organisms in the treated animals to grow 1 log10 as compared with controls after serum drug concentrations had fallen below the mic. drug concentrations exceeded the mic for 1.2-3.2 h, but bactericidal activity occurred mainly during the first hour. when the agents were used singly a negative pae was produced by ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa, a pae of approximately 0 h by imipenem against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, a pae of 2-4 h by cefazolin against s. aureus, gentamicin against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and imipenem and tobramycin against p. aeruginosa, and a pae of 6-7 h by gentamicin against s. aureus and rifampicin against p. aeruginosa. the beta-lactam/aminoglycoside combinations when used against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa prolonged the pae by 1.0-3.3 h, compared with the longer of the individual drug paes, but no prolongation was observed against e. coli and k. pneumoniae. ceftazidime reduced the pae when used with tobramycin against p. aeruginosa. the long pae of rifampicin against p. aeruginosa was 'carried over' to the combination, thus prolonging the growth suppression achieved by imipenem and tobramycin alone or in combination by 5.5-8.0 h. this effect on the pae was additive only, and synergy was not observed. in conclusion, a potentially significant prolongation of the pae by combination of drugs was observed in vivo, but only if both (or all) agents induced a pae when used alone. the impact of this observation needs to be examined further in studies involving multiple and different dosing regimens in an infection model.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk-037, a parenteral cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk-037, 5-amino-2-[[(6r, 7r)-7-[[(z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyimino) acetyl] amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1h-pyrazoli um hydroxide, inner salt, sulfate (1:1), a new parenteral cephem, was compared with those of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. fk-037 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylocci at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. of 98 isolates of homogenous methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 55 (56.1%) were inhibited by 8 micrograms of fk-037 per ml, compared to 3.1% for cefepime. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam tested against staphylococci. the mic of fk-037 for 90% of the strains tested (mic90) was 0.06 micrograms/ml for hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and streptococcus bovis. the mic90 for many of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae was 1 microgram/ml, similar to that of cefepime and lower than those of ceftazidime and imipenem. the mic90 for klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae was 8 micrograms/ml, similar to that for cefepime, but all isolates were inhibited by 2 micrograms of imipenem per ml. k. pneumoniae isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime mics of > 32 micrograms/ml with bush type 2b' beta-lactamases were inhibited by 4 micrograms of fk-037 per ml. e. cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and s. aureus stably resistant to fk-037 could be selected by repeated transfer in the presence of fk-037. the fk-037 mic90 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4 microgram/ml, compared to 32 microgram/ml for cefepime and ceftazidime and 8 microgram/ml for imipenem. xanthomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter anitratus, and bacteroides species were resistant to fk-037 (mic, more than or equal 32 microgram/ml). mbcs were identical to or within twofold of the mics except for a 32-fold greater mbc for p. aeruginosa. inoculum size and acid environment did not lower the activity of fk-037. fk-037 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by bush group 1, 2a, 2b, and 2e beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by 2b' and 2d enzymes at rates comparable to that of ceftazidime. nonetheless, fk-037 inhibited bacteria possessing tem-3, -5, and -7 and shv -5 at less than or equal 8 microgram/ml. overall, fk-037 has lower mics against staphylococci and p. aeruginosa than the currently available iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporins and has activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae comparable to that of cefepime.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is an oxime-type cephem antibiotic with a  1-hydroxyethyl-5-amino-pyrazole moiety at the 3 position. fk037 was evaluated for antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, fk037 was twofold or more active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic for 90% of the strains [mic90] = 32 micrograms/ml), members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic90 < or = 2 micrograms/ml), group a streptococci (mic90 = 0.015 microgram/ml), and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). in addition, the activity of fk037 was equal to or greater than that of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 0.12 microgram/ml) and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). fk037 was more active in vitro than cefepime (two- to fourfold) and cefpirome (twofold) against s. aureus. in murine systemic infection models, fk037 showed potent activity against p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant s. aureus. fk037 was also efficacious in a mouse model of pyelonephritis caused by s. aureus or klebsiella pneumoniae and in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia caused by s. pneumoniae. additional studies on this compound to assess its potential clinical utility are warranted.
[clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (cfpz, bmy-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. cfpz was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute uti, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. the effectiveness rate was 96.4%. bacteriologically, 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-streptococcus, 1 strain of klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of salmonella c2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. the bacteriological eradication rates for gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against gram-positive bacteria. no side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. as abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. in conclusion, cfpz was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
[evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefazolin alone and in combination with cefmetazole or flomoxef using agar dilution method and disk diffusion method].
antimicrobial activities of cefazolin (cez) against 251 strains of various clinical isolates obtained during 1989 and 1990 were determined using the mueller-hinton agar dilution method at an inoculum level 10(6) cfu/ml. the reliability of the disk susceptility test was also studied using mueller-hinton agar and various disks at inoculum levels of 10(3-4) cfu/cm2 in estimating approximate values of mics. in addition, antimicrobial activities of cez and cefmetazole (cmz) or flomoxef (fmox) in combination were investigated against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa) using the checkerboard agar dilution mic method and the disk diffusion test either with the disks contained cez, cmz, and fmox alone, or cez, and cmz or fmox in combination. in this study, the mics of cez against s. aureus were distributed with the 3 peak values at 0.39 microgram/ml, 3.13 micrograms/ml and > 100 micrograms/ml. mics against mssa were 0.39 microgram/ml to 0.78 microgram/ml, whereas those against mrsa were greater than 0.78 microgram/ml. mics against majority of strains of enterococcus faecalis were 25 micrograms/ml. over 90% of strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at the level of 3.13 micrograms/ml. about 60% of isolates of indole negative proteus spp. were inhibited at the levels of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml and 100% at 6.25 micrograms/ml, but mics against indole positive proteus spp., serratia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were over 100 micrograms/ml. the antimicrobial activities of cez against these clinical isolates were not significantly different compared to those reported about 15-20 years ago, except for s. aureus. highly resistant strains of s. aureus to cez were more prevalent in this study. the inhibitory zones obtained with the disk test were compared with mics. the results of cez disk susceptibility test with 30 micrograms disk (showa) or 10 micrograms disk (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics (r = -0.837 and -0.814, respectively), showing the reliavility of the disk method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used in japan, break points in mic values proposed are () mic < or = 3 micrograms/ml, (++) > 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) > 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) > 60 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 7.7% and false negative in 6.8% of the samples. the disk results with e. faecalis showed a higher ratio of false positive results.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
antibacterial activity of fluoroquinolones local clinical isolates from a referral center in riyadh.
a total of 1,034 clinical isolates from a tertiary care center were tested against six fluoroquinolones, namely norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin, and ci-960. bacteria tested consisted of 579 strains of enterobacteriaceae, 98 pseudomonads, 51 acinetebacter, 56 enterococci and 250 isolates of staphylococci. all six fluoroquinolones showed excellent in vitro activity inhibiting >90% of escherichia coli at an mic of < 0.03-0.5 mg/l, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.12-2.0 mg/l, enterobacter at 0.12-2.0 mg/l, serratia marcescens at 0.12-2.0 mg/l, pseumodonas aeruginosa at 0.5-2.0 mg/l, staphylococcus aureus at < 0.03-1.0 mg/l, and coagulase negative staphylococci at an mic of 0.12-2.0 mg/l xanthomonas maltophilia showed some resistance to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin and temafloxacin, but was inhibited by sparfloxacin and ci-960. a majority of isolates of enterococci were resistant to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and ci-960, but sparfloxacin and temafloxacin inhibited 92% and 82% of these strains, respectively.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of e1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
e1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the in vitro activities of e1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic of e1077 for 90% of the strains tested [mic90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. against enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), e1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. the mic90s of e1077 for streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; e1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. e1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of serratia marcescens and proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). the activity of e1077 against p. aeruginosa (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. in vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. e1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. the protective effects of e1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of e1077 caused swelling of s. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in p. aeruginosa. in general, the antibacterial profile of e1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.
bactericidal activities of rat defensins and synthetic rabbit defensins on staphylococci, klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid, 277, and 8n3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid strains), salmonella typhimurium (ra, rc, rd, and re of lps mutants) and escherichia coli.
rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. staphylococcus aureus (209p, cowan i, smith diffuse and smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and k) and klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid, 277, and 8n3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of salmonella typhimurium lt2, such as ra, rc, rd, and re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. lysozyme did not show any bactericidal activity except against m. lysodeikticus and b. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against s. typhimurium and s. aureus. with regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, np1, np4, and np5, np1 showed strong bactericidal activity against k. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. neither np4 nor np5 showed any bactericidal activity, while np5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of np1 against k. pneumoniae 277.
antibacterial activity of the new quinolone ci-960 (pd 127391) against clinical isolates at a major tertiary care center in saudi arabia.
the antibacterial activity of the new fluoroquinolone ci-960 (pd 127391) was evaluated against 1,162 clinical isolates and compared with other quinolones and various commonly used antibiotics. ci-960 was highly effective against members of enterobacteriaceae inhibiting 626 of the 629 isolates at a less than or equal to 0.03 to 0.12 microgram/ml concentration. all the 305 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomona maltophilia, and acinetobacter were susceptible to ci-960. it was the only effective drug against 10 multi-resistant isolates of pseudomonads and acinetobacter. all staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03-0.5 microgram/ml of ci-960. like other drugs of its class, it had little activity against enterococci.
major trends in the microbial etiology of nosocomial infection.
to determine trends in the microbial etiology of nosocomial infections in the 1980s, surveillance data on the microbiology of documented nosocomial infection reported to the national nosocomial infections surveillance system and from the university of michigan hospital were analyzed. antimicrobial susceptibility data on selected pathogens from both sources were also reviewed. overall, escherichia coli decreased from 23% of infections in 1980 to 16% in 1986-1989, klebsiella pneumoniae dropped from 7% to 5%, whereas coagulase negative staphylococci increased from 4% to 9% and candida albicans increased from 2% to 5%. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter species and enterococci had minor increases, but antimicrobial resistant strains for these pathogens as well as coagulase-negative staphylococci were seen more frequently. in contrast to the 1970s, major shifts in the etiology of nosocomial infection have occurred in the decade of the 1980s. taken as a whole, the shifts are away from more easily treated pathogens toward more resistant pathogens with fewer options for therapy. these shifts underscore the continued need for prevention and control to accompany new developments in therapy.
the differential effect of cigarette smoke on the growth of bacteria found in humans.
the effect of cigarette smoke on growth of those species of bacteria that are considered common potential human pathogens was examined in vitro. smoke from both mentholated and nonmentholated cigarettes inhibited the growth of gram-positive cocci to a greater degree than that of gram-negative rods. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and a variety of other streptococci were inhibited at a smoke solution dilution of 1:8. enteric bacteria such as klebsiella, enterobacter, and pseudomonas were not affected by a 1:1 dilution of the solution. as with the gram-positive cocci, the neisseria species and branhamella were also inhibited at a dilution of 1:8. culture results of the mouth of 15 smokers and 15 nonsmokers showed that the smokers have a propensity to develop heavy gram-negative bacterial colonization.
in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.
[bacteriological and clinical studies of cefodizime in pediatrics].
bacteriological and clinical studies on cefodizime (cdzm, thr-221), a new cephem  developed by hoechst ag and roussel uclaf, were carried out and the results are summarized below: 1. against gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, antibacterial activities of cdzm were similar to those of cefotaxime (ctx), cefazolin, cefotiam and piperacillin. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., antibacterial activities of cdzm were similar to that of ctx, and superior to those of other tested antibiotics. especially against haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis, it showed an excellent antibacterial activity. 2. although the clinical efficacy was poor in 1 patient with sepsis caused by salmonella marcescens and in another with cervical lymphadenitis, in 5 patients with upper respiratory tract infection, 4 patients with bronchitis, 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, 18 patients with pneumonia, 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 1 patient with enteritis, the clinical efficacy was excellent or good and the efficacy rate was 95.1% (39/41) including excellent efficacies in 25 cases. 3. bacteriologically, all identified causative bacteria were eradicated except for 1 case of salmonella sp., thus the eradication rate was 97.4% (38/39). especially s. pneumoniae in 10 cases, h. influenzae in 12 cases and b. catarrhalis in 3 cases were eradicated totally. 4. adverse reactions were studied in 46 cases, and digestive symptoms were observed in 9 cases (diarrhea 5 cases, loose stools 4 cases). eruption and vascular pain were observed in 1 case each. as digestive symptoms in 9 cases were mild, the treatment were not suspended. in laboratory test values, elevation of got, elevation of gpt, elevation of bilirubin, and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. no change was observed between the beginning and the end of the treatment. from above results, we have concluded that cdzm is a useful and safe antibiotic in pediatrics, administered at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses and administered intravenously.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[antimicrobial activities of gentamicin against fresh clinical isolates].
antimicrobial activities of gentamicin (gm), compared with activities of other aminoglycosides (ags) and beta-lactam antibiotics, were studied against clinical isolates obtained during a period of july-december 1989. 1. gm-resistant strains were noted in 24% of staphylococcus aureus, 12% of enterobacter spp., 24% of serratia marcescens, 7% of morganella morganii and 26% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, but no gm-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris. 2. a majority of gm-resistant strains of s. aureus were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and a large number of gm-resistant strains of enterobacter spp. was also resistant to new quinolones. gm showed, however, strong antimicrobial activities against new quinolones-resistant strains of s. marcescens, m. morganii and p. aeruginosa. 3. among all the isolates tested of s. marcescens, 24% were gm-resistant, 72% were tobramycin (tob)-resistant, 86% were dibekacin (dkb)-resistant and 64% were amikacin (amk)-resistant, hence the incidence of gm-resistant strains was the lowest. this tendency was also observed with p. vulgaris. however, among p. aeruginosa, 26% were gm-resistant, 14% tob-resistant, 18% dkb-resistant and 22% amk-resistant, thus the incidence rate for gm-resistance was somewhat higher. these results suggest that different ags-modification enzymes were produced by various clinical isolates under the present condition. 4. comparing the ratio of gm-resistant strains in the present study with those in 1980 and 1983, the ratio increased among s. aureus, while decreases were observed among enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris and p. aeruginosa, indicating that a unilateral tendency of increases in gm-resistant strains did not exist among clinical isolates over the years.
antimicrobial activity of naphthoquinones from fusaria.
twenty-two naphthoquinone compounds isolated or derived synthetically from culture extracts of fusarium solani and f. oxysporum were examined for antimicrobial activity. fifteen exhibited antibiotic activity against staphylococcus aureus, and 12 were active against streptococcus pyogenes, but none were active at the highest rate of 128 micrograms/ml against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. of 8 plant pathogenic bacteria tested against 11 naphthoquinones, corynebacterium poinsettiae was inhibited by 6 compounds, and pseudomonas viridiflava was weakly inhibited by one. only one of a group of 6 fluorescent soil pseudomonads was inhibited by one naphthoquinone. antifungal activity of 10 compounds against 8 fungal plant pathogens was limited to inhibition of phytophthora parasitica by one naphthopyran.
therapeutic studies of cefepime (bmy 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
cefepime (bmy 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. mice were infected intracranially with streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with haemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and s. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with s. agalactiae. cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and e. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa meningitis. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against s. pneumoniae and s. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. against h. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. ceftazidime was the least active compound. the pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
[clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam in neonates].
clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (azt) were performed in neonates. the results are summarized as follows: a total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. azt 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. concomitantly, vancomycin (vcm) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (abpc) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for 2-6 days. of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of azt were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. all of the causative organisms (escherichia coli in 3 and enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with azt. neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by azt was observed. mics of azt against 10 clinical isolates (staphylococcus aureus 1, e. coli 4, klebsiella pneumoniae 1, e. cloacae 1, haemophilus influenzae 1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. as results, azt showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against p. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
postantibiotic effect of the penem fce 22101 against selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro and in vivo by the use of a tissue cage model in rabbits.
isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae were tested for their bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect (pae) with the new penem fce 22101. the tissue cage model in rabbits was used to study pae in vivo. the bactericidal activity against all four species was shown to be in the range of 0.05-4.0 mg/l. a 99.9% killing effect at mbc concentrations was reached within 2 hours with s. pneumoniae and k. pneumoniae and within 6-8 hours with s. aureus and h. influenzae. after in vitro exposure by fce 22101 a pae in vitro and in vivo was obtained against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae strains but no pae could be demonstrated against k. pneumoniae. fce 22101 showed a good bactericidal activity and pae against the strains investigated, except for k. pneumoniae.
influence of the addition of mineral salts on the inhibitory activity of strains  of the arthrinium genus.
the influence which the addition of certain mineral salts has on the inhibiting activity of strains belonging to the arthrinium genus was studied. the salts employed were agno3, fecl2, mncl2 and cuso4, in concentrations of 10, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/l, in the presence of bacillus subtilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans and aspergillus niger. for b. subtilis and s. aureus greater inhibition was observed after the addition of fecl2 (200 mg/l) and mncl2 (10 mg/l). e. coli showed a greater sensibility in the presence of agno3 (200 mg/l) and cuso4 (150 mg/l). inhibition before enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens was not increased by the addition of any of the salts. the addition of mncl2 at 10 mg/l concentration to the basal medium showed a considerable increase of inhibitory activity over klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans. activity for aspergillus niger decreased when any of the salts were added to the medium.
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1987)].
since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. in the period from october, 1987 to september, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562 patients with respiratory tract infections. strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. the taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (120), haemophilus influenzae (170), mucoid-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), non-mucoid-producing p. aeruginosa (87), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (35), brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. of these strains, 629 were used to determine mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. most of the major causative organisms, such as h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but s. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of s. aureus (mcrsa) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
in vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
the dual-action antibacterial r 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. it was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (staphylococcus aureus 753, serratia marcescens sm and pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and streptococcus pyogenes. in prophylactic studies, ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against s. pyogenes, but ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against e. coli and more active than fleroxacin against s. pyogenes. in a murine pneumonia model, ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae. fleroxacin was inactive against s. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than ro 23-9424 against k. pneumoniae. in a murine meningitis infection caused by s. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was 3 times as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. when meningitis was induced by k. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. in a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against p. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. in the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.

enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. the following is a report of the 1986 findings. during the period from september, 1986 to march, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. of these strains, 75 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 108 of streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of haemophilus influenzae, 107 of pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of p. aeruginosa (mucoid production type), 32 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of escherichia coli, and 55 of branhamella catarrhalis were subjected to mic determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. in addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. mic determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. from the 558 cases of respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. of these strains, 603 could be used for mic determination. an overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, p. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. when the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. the percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. the disease which was comparatively frequent in all age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. the next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
in vitro activity of dactimicin, a novel pseudodisaccharide aminoglycoside, compared with activities of other aminoglycosides.
the in vitro activity of dactimicin, a new pseudodisaccharide aminoglycoside which possesses a formimidoyl group, was compared with those of gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin against 500 isolates. dactimicin inhibited 90% of isolates from the family enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. it was more active than amikacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, enterobacter agglomerans, yersinia species, and salmonella species, with an mic for 90% of the strains (mic90) of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. the mic90s for the pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. dactimicin did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates and coagulase-negative staphylococci but had an mic50 (mic for 50% of strains tested) of 2 micrograms/ml against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates and coagulase-negative staphylococci. dactimicin in combination with piperacillin acted synergistically against 75% of escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus isolates. it exhibited an excellent postantibiotic suppressive effect on e. coli. dactimicin was active against organisms possessing aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including aac(2')-b, aac(3)-iii, -iv, and -v, and aac(6')-ia, -ib, ic, -ii, and -iv but was not active against isolates which contained aac(3)-i and the bifunctional aph(2")-aac(6')-i. its lack of activity against p. aeruginosa appeared to be permeability related since in the presence of edta p. aeruginosa was susceptible, as were mutant isolates resistant because of permeability barriers.
[bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
in bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpodoxime proxetil  (cpdx-pr, cs-807), the following results were obtained: 1. antibacteriological activity antibacteriological activity of r-3746 (na-salt of cefpodoxime), cefaclor (ccl), cephalexin, cefroxadine (cxd), cefazolin (cez), cephalothin (cet) and amoxicillin (ampc) were studied against clinical isolated bacteria following as: staphylococcus aureus (resistant or sensitive of methicillin), escherichia coli (resistant or sensitive to cez), klebsiella pneumoniae (resistant or sensitive to cez), proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae. antibacterial activities of cxd and cet, however, were not tested against methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or cez resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. r-3746 showed stronger activities than any of the other oral antibiotics against these strains except s. aureus against which it showed slightly less activity than ampc. most frequent mic values of r-3746 to s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis were 1.56, 0.39, less than or equal to 0.10 and less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. against isolated strains of mrsa, mics of r-3746 were higher than 25 micrograms/ml with 23 strains (77%), which were similar to mic values of ccl and ampc against these organisms. mic values of r-3746 against cez resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae were superior to mics of other antibiotics, and the mic50 value was 0.20 micrograms/ml. against many isolated strains of e. cloacae mic values of r-3746 were relatively high ranging 0.78 to greater than 100 micrograms/ml. mic50 of r-3746 against e. cloacae was 12.5 micrograms/ml. 2. absorption and excretion serum concentration and urinary excretion of cpdx (the active form of cpdx-pr) were studied upon single oral administration of cpdx-pr at 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg (dry syrup) or 100 mg (tablet). the peak of serum concentration of cpdx was attained in 1-6 hours 1-4 hours and 2-6 hours after administration of cpdx-pr at the 3 different dosage levels, and they were 0.99-2.99 micrograms/ml, 4.30-7.05 micrograms/ml and 1.65-2.93 micrograms/ml, respectively. at 8 hours after administration, mean concentrations of cpdx for the 3 groups were 0.31, 0.83 and 0.66 micrograms/ml, respectively. as the average auc's for the 3 groups were 8.16, 25.97 and 10.79 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. urinary recovery rates of cpdx for the 3 groups were 20.9-56.2, 28.3-49.7 and 35.1-50.4%, respectively in the first 8 hours after administration.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new carbapenem, sm-7338.
sm-7338, a new carbapenem, inhibited most members of the family enterobacteriaceae at mics of 0.015 to 0.25 microgram/ml, including klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus vulgaris isolates resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and gentamicin. it was two- to eightfold more active than imipenem, but it inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1 to 8 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of imipenem. haemophilus, neisseria, and branhamella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, which was superior to the activity of imipenem. sm-7338 inhibited staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at 0.25 microgram/ml, but for methicillin-resistant isolates mics were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. group a, b, and c streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. bacteroides species, including clindamycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml. there was no major inoculum size effect, and the mbcs were within a dilution of the mics. sm-7338 was more active than imipenem at an acid ph under anaerobic conditions. plasmid beta-lactamases of tem-1, tem-2, tem-3, tem-5, shv-1, shv-2, pse-1, pse-2, pse-3, oxa-2, oxa-3, oxa-4, oxa-5, and oxa-7; staphylococcus aureus enzymes; and the chromosomal beta-lactamases p-99 and k-1; morganella species; and proteus vulgaris did not hydrolyze sm-7338. the repeated transfer of organisms increased the mics of sm-7338, as it did the mics of imipenem.
[antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (cftm) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. antibacterial activities of cftm against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (ccl). 2. activities of cefixime (cfix) were superior to those of cftm against b. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to cftm against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus. 3. activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of ccl against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and s. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to cftm and cfix against most of gram-negative rods. 4. sultamicillin (sbtpc) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its mics did not exceed the mics of ampicillin by itself. sbtpc showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
[respiratory infectious complications in patients with lung cancer].
since respiratory infectious complications in lung cancer cases are major obstacles for adequate or intensive anticancer chemotherapy, they often affect prognosis unfavorably. such respiratory infections secondary to lung cancer generally occur on the basis of defects of the defence mechanism against infections due to disturbance in the clearance system in sites peripheral to bronchial obstruction or stenosis. the lowered concentration of antimicrobial agents at the site of infection, resulting from decreased local pulmonary blood flow, make the infections difficult to manage. moreover, immunosuppression resulting from the use of anticancer drugs, most of which inevitably possess immunosuppressive effect, become a cause of infections with opportunistic pathogens such as enterobacteriaceae, glucose nonfermentative bacilli and anaerobes. since the recent wide and frequent use of 3rd generation cephem antibiotics, an apparent increase in the incidence of staphylococcus aureus as a causative organism has been observed, in contrast to a marked decrease in that of klebsiella pneumoniae. in patients who received intensive chemotherapy repeatedly or are in the terminal stage, an imbalance of t cell lymphocytes subsets, namely a lowered t+4 vs t+8 ratio, are frequently observed. under these conditions, pulmonary involvement due to reactivation of a latent virus, i.e. cytomegalovirus and/or protozoa, i.e. pneumocystis carinii could be a cause of death.
comparative in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin and other unrelated antimicrobials against bacterial respiratory tract pathogens.
ciprofloxacin is a new fluorinated 4-quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity which includes both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. in this study the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin has been determined against bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections and compared with that of other antimicrobial agents used in the therapy of such infections. ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.008 mg/l) was highly active against haemophilus influenzae, including isolates producing beta-lactamase which were resistant to amoxycillin. ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l) was also highly active against branhamella catarrhalis, again including those isolates resistant to amoxycillin as a result of beta-lactamase production. isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were less susceptible to ciprofloxacin (mic90 2 mg/l) but were highly susceptible to amoxycillin (mic90 less than 0.12 mg/l) and erythromycin (mic90 0.25 mg/l). isolates of klebsiella aerogenes were highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but much less so to amoxycillin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, oxytetracycline and erythromycin. ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.5 mg/l) was very active against staphylococcus aureus, including those isolates resistant to amoxycillin and flucloxacillin, and against mycoplasma pneumoniae. together with rifampicin and erythromycin, ciprofloxacin was highly active against legionella pneumophila (mic90 0.015 mg/l). these results suggest that clinical evaluation of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections is justified.
group b streptococci inhibit the chemotactic activity of the fifth component of complement.
infection with group b streptococci (gbs) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. in the present studies, we have examined the effects of group b streptococci on c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. fresh human serum was activated to form c5a and c5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. the activated serum was then incubated with group b organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. group b organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in c-dependent chemotactic activity. the degree of inhibition was profound with 1 x 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). experiments indicated that significant chemotactic factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to gbs organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. a number of different strains of gbs of types i, ii, and iii possessed inhibitory activity. in contrast, group d streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. group a streptococci that were m protein positive also inactivated c-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. the inhibitory activity of the gbs strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. c5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by ria were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain suggesting that absorption was not involved. sds-page analysis revealed that group b streptococci degrade the c5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 da. thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of gbs infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate c-derived inflammatory mediators. the gbs c5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group b streptococcal infection.
[clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
reliability of the cefamandole (cmd) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cmd). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cmd disc tests, which is normally used in japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. the results obtained with the disc method were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cmd disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. in this study, approximately 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by cmd at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to cmd at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. cmd was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. about 90% of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml cmd of highly methicillin-resistant strains (mic greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus were examined. ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to cmd, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
application of a microcomputer-based system in the analysis of infection data at  the emergency units of a large hospital.
after three years of retrospective study in four emergency units from a large hospital (2000 beds) and analysis of 6283 positive cultures, a microcomputer database system was built to store information concerning nosocomial infections in order to help the clinical staff from those units to study the incidence of 20 bacterial species and their sensitivity pattern evolutions for 27 antibiotics (from samples in 15 different collecting sites). this system was developed as an alternative to the hospital mainframe computer microbiological reports. it put emphasis on graphical outputs instead of the coded tables generated by the bigger system. this orientation and the possibility of sectorial infection data analysis were responsible for the general acceptance of the microcomputer-based system by the clinical staff. as the first practical results, the system was able to detect a particular increase in the incidence of staphylococcus aureus in surgical emergency units (up to 21.6% in 1982) as well as the dissemination of the antimicrobial resistance patterns of s. aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae from the surgical units to the clinical ones. the time evolution behaviour of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and other nonfermentative gram negative bacilli was also studied to complete the analysis of the most pathogenic bacterial species found in our emergency units.
comparable evaluation of orally active beta-lactam compounds in ampicillin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative rods: role of beta-lactamases on resistance.
the antibacterial activity of the recently developed cephems cefixime and cefetamet-pivoxyl was evaluated in 408 gram-positive and gram-negative rods, all isolated recently from clinical specimens, and compared to that of other orally active agents such as ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime-axetil and to ceftriaxone. with regard to ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae ceftriaxone proved to be the most active agent, followed by cefixime and cefetamet, whereas cefuroxime was less active. cefaclor and amoxycillin + claculanic acid were active against ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus ssp. isolates. all beta-lactam compounds exhibited poor activity against acinetobacter anitratus isolates, but were highly active against haemophilus influenzae with the exception of cefaclor. both cefixime and cefetamet were poorly active against staphylococcus aureus, but highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, both compounds remained unaffected by the production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the tem or oxa enzymes. resistance to both agents was observed in enterobacteriaceae that produced large amounts of chromosomally mediated enzymes; their affinity to the class i enzyme from enterobacter cloacae was somewhat lower than that of other third-generation cephalosporins. however, in contrast with these agents breakdown of cefixime and cefetamet by a class iiia enzyme form proteus vulgaris was marginal. in methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates there was a complete cross-resistance between all beta-lactam compounds included in this study.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
cs-807 is a new oral prodrug of r-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to r-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. ninety percent or more of pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus spp., providencia rettgeri, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of staphylococcus epidermidis, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to r-3746. the activity of r-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. r-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of r-3746 at concentrations above the mic. r-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of staphylococcus aureus and 1a, 1bs, and 3 of escherichia coli. systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of cs-807.
[treatment of post-traumatic and post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis with ceftriaxone alone or in combination with fosfomycin].
from 1984 to 1986, 13 patients (10 adults, 3 children) with bacterial meningitis  following neurosurgery or traumatism were given ceftriaxone alone 6 times at a dose of 40 mg/kg one iv injection per day, or in association 7 times with fosfomycin at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day, 3 iv perfusions every 4 h. the bacteriological diagnosis was confirmed in 9 cases (3 staphylococcus aureus, 4 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 klebsiella, 1 peptococcus). in vitro neither synergy nor antagonism were observed between the two antimicrobial agents. the acute infections episode resolved in all patients except on who died with a negative csf culture. one superinfection meningitis with achromobacter was seen. csf concentrations of ceftriaxone were assayed and found to be comparable with those reported by most authors. tolerance was excellent for all our patients.
[fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
[clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
a comparison of cefonicid with other beta-lactams regarding the effect of human and mouse sera on antibacterial activity.
the effect of the addition of 50% human or mouse serum on the antibacterial activity of cefonicid, three first generation cephalosporins and ampicillin was studied. human serum added to the test system considerably reduced the activity of cefonicid against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains, and to a lesser degree against proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. human serum also reduced, albeit to a lesser extent, the activities of cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin, whereas it increased the activity of cephaloridine. in contrast, mouse serum did not or only insignificantly reduced the activity of cefonicid against some of the bacterial isolates; this is reflected in the excellent protective effect of cefonicid in experimental mouse infections.
preferential secretion of a common anti-dna idiotype (16/6 id) and anti-polynucleotide antibodies by normal mononuclear cells following stimulation with klebsiella pneumoniae.
peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 6 normal subjects were incubated  with 5 polyclonal activators (pokeweed mitogen, epstein-barr virus, group-a streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae. after 7 days of incubation, the supernatants were examined for immunoglobulin (igg and igm) production, the level of a common anti-dna idiotype (16/6 id) and autoantibody activity against ssdna, dsdna, poly(i), poly(dt) and cardiolipin. significantly increased levels of the 16/6 id were recorded only with the klebsiella stimulated mnc. increased immunoglobulin levels and autoantibody reactivity were noted with all 5 polyclonal activators. the klebsiella cell membrane preparation induced the highest values. no correlation was found between the 16/6 levels, autoantibody activity and the absolute concentrations of igg or igm. this study, together with previous reports, suggests a role for klebsiella in the etiology of autoimmune diseases. we suggest that klebsiella can induce anti-dna-like autoantibodies not only by polyclonal activation, but also by a more specific stimulus.
timentin and beta-lactamases.
ticarcillin is resistant to the action of cephalosporinases, which explains its biological activity on a large number of bacterial species, including cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. nevertheless, its antibacterial activity is often limited by the action of some beta-lactamases, mostly plasmid-mediated penicillinases. clavulanic acid by itself has poor antibacterial activity, but its most important property is to inhibit and inactivate beta-lactamases. the inhibitory properties of clavulanic acid were studied on a large number of beta-lactamases. the penicillinases produced by staphylococcus aureus, the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the tem-type, the chromosomally-mediated penicillinases from klebsiella pneumoniae and other closely-related beta-lactamases, and a few chromosomally-mediated cephalosporinases, such as that produced by proteus vulgaris, are powerfully inhibited by clavulanic acid. the plasmid-mediated penicillinases of oxa type and most of the chromosomally-mediated cephalosporinases, such as that produced by escherichia coli (amp c), are less or poorly inhibited. moreover, clavulanic acid has some cephalosporinase-inducing properties. these properties are in good agreement with the bacteriological properties of timentin.
comparative activity of ofloxacin and seven other antimicrobials against urea-splitting microorganisms.
urinary tract infections caused by urea-splitting bacteria are severe clinical conditions and very difficult to treat due to their association with calculi, and because such bacteria form ammonium hydroxide raising the urinary ph and thereby creating an unfavourable condition for the action of most antimicrobials. we tested ofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and nitrofurantoin against 143 gram-negative and 99 gram-positive bacteria, all urea-splitting, isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. all drugs were tested using media at two different phs (ph 7.4 and ph 8.5) and two inoculum sizes (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). although ofloxacin and norfloxacin had a similar spectrum of activity, ofloxacin had somewhat greater intrinsic activity against gram-positive organisms. mics of ofloxacin for 90% of proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and the corynebacterium group d2 were greater than or equal to 4 mg/l. the activity of the other drugs varied, but there were many strains resistant to these antimicrobials. the ph and inoculum size did not significantly affect the activity of ofloxacin so that this drug should be useful for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by the commonest urea-splitting bacteria involved in such infections.
growth of bacteria in enteral feeding solutions.
solutions of clinifeed iso, triosorbon, vivonex standard (full- and half-strength) and vivonex hn were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees c and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. no increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees c. all organisms multiplied rapidly in clinifeed iso and in triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees c. there was less rapid growth in half-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, although at 37 degrees c all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two s. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength vivonex standard at both 25 and 37 degrees c. in full-strength vivonex standard at 25 degrees c, only p. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas p. aeruginosa, k. aerogenes and e. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees c. none of the test organisms multiplied in full strength vivonex hn at any of the temperatures studied. the results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low ph and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.
[reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. the range of immunological specificity of escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
the antigenic specificity of e. coli m17 peptidoglycans (pg) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with pg opsonized with the whole and exhausted igg fraction of human serum. within the generic taxon, the pg under study were similar in their antigenic properties. the opsonic activity of igg exhausted with the preparations of different e. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. an essential difference of e. coli pg from similar components of other representatives of the family enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. after the removal of antibodies to pg of remote taxons (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). the results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of pg at different taxonomic levels.
in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability and inhibitory properties of a new penem antibiotic, sch 34343.
sch 34343 is a new penem antibiotic. its in-vitro activity was determined against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. sch 34343 inhibited 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp, citrobacter spp. and shigella spp. at less than 1 mg/1. ninety per cent of strains of enterobacter, morganella and providencia spp. were inhibited by less than 4 mg/1. sch 34343 did not inhibit pseudomonas spp., and it had slightly less activity against enterobacteriaceae than did cefotaxime or latamoxef (moxalactam), but it inhibited organisms resistant to cefoxitin, cefoperazone and piperacillin. sch 34343 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/1, and it inhibited haemolytic streptococci at less than or equal to 0.06 mg/1. sch 34343 inhibited bacteroides fragilis at 0.06 mg/1, including some cefoxitin-resistant isolates. sch 34343 was not hydrolysed by plasmid- or chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, was an excellent inhibitor of richmond-sykes type ia beta-lactamases, and also inhibited, although less effectively, the common plasmid beta-lactamases. it induced beta-lactamases, but inhibited enterobacter and citrobacter spp. in which it induced beta-lactamase activity.
the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome (hr 810), a pyridine cephalosporin agent active against staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new cyclopyridinium cephalosporin, was evaluated against 947 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. cefpirome inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, aeromonas spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp. and haemophilus and neisseria species at less than or equal to 0.4 mg/l. it had activity comparable to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and moxalactam against these species. only a few citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp. and serratia marcescens had mics above 3.1 mg/l. the activity of cefpirome against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% mic of 12.5 mg/l, was superior to piperacillin, moxalactam, cefotaxime and cefoperazone. the 90% mic against staphylococcus aureus was 0.8 mg/l, but methicillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited. cefpirome was not significantly hydrolyzed by most plasmid beta-lactamases (tem, shv-1, pse, oxa) nor by chromosomal enzymes (p99, branhamella catarrhalis, k1). cefpirome did not inhibit chromosomal or plasmid beta-lactamases. mice systemically infected with e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were protected by concentrations of cefpirome ranging from 0.85 mg/kg for k. pneumoniae to 4.467 mg/kg for p. aeruginosa.
dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. the disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the united states were compared. no significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus faecalis for this period; enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. slight increases in susceptibility were observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
trends in bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
concern over the development of drug resistance by common pathogens has grown over recent years. in order to discover and describe possible trends at this institution, susceptibility data for 18 organisms and 21 antimicrobial agents for the years 1975 through 1982 at the veterans administration medical center in oklahoma city were reviewed. summaries of susceptibility data for 64 major combinations of drugs and organisms are presented. two gram-positive organisms (enterococcus group d and staphylococcus aureus) as well as a gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa) appear to be decreasing in susceptibility to several drugs. however, some gram-negative bacilli (proteus, serratia, and enterobacter spp. and klebsiella pneumoniae) showed evidence of markedly increasing susceptibility to certain drugs.
in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., shigella sonnei, salmonella typhi, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. the activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against ps. aeruginosa. pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant ps. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant staph. aureus. strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
in vitro combination effects of cefotetan with four aminoglycosides, piperacillin and mezlocillin on gram-positive and gram-negative nosocomial bacteria.
the in vitro efficacy of cefotetan in combination with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter cloacae and with piperacillin and mezlocillin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae was compared by use of the checkerboard agar dilution technique. on average, 60% of the gram-negative and 46% of the gram-positive strains were inhibited by additive, but only 22% of the gram-negative and 2% of the gram-positive bacteria were inhibited by synergistic cefotetan-aminoglycoside combinations. netilmicin combinations were least active. on gram-negative bacteria, 63% of the cefotetan-penicillin combinations were additive and 11% synergistic. no antagonism occurred with any of the combinations.
use of a laser-doppler electrophoresis method in bacteriology (preliminary results).
a new electrophoresis system using laser doppler velocimetry has been developed.  this technic allows fast measurements, (1 minute) over a large number of particles (several thousand or more). furthermore, the small size of the particles is no longer a limitation of the measurement. these qualities made it possible to study the electrokinetic properties of cells. in this paper the authors present the first application obtained on different types of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris) submitted to five antibiotics (gentamycin, minocyclin, cephalotin, spiramycin, sobramycin). after four hours of incubation at 37 degrees c, important decreases of electrophoretic mobility were observed on bacteria treated with antibiotics to which they were sensitive. on the other hand, no significant modification appeared on bacteria treated with antibiotics to which they were not sensitive. in conclusion, the electrophoretic mobility test seems to be useful to study the response of bacteria to antibiotics and perhaps could be used to set antibiograms.
antibacterial activity studies of flavonoids from salvia palaestina.
ten aglycones and six glycosides of luteolin and apigenin were identified from the leaves of salvia palaestina bentham (labiatae). among them cirsimaritin showed a high activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the others have little or no activity against the same bacterial strains.
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1981)].
during the period from september 1981 to march 1982, 363 bacterial isolates were  obtained as possible pathogens from 311 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in japan. of these clinical isolates, mostly from the sputum, a total of 231 isolates including 19 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 33 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 90 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 65 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 7 strains of escherichia coli were tested in vitro for minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antimicrobial agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility distribution and cumulative percentages of inhibited isolates by increasing concentrations of drugs were determined. the data were further analyzed to investigate the interrelation between such parameters as the age-distribution of patients by diseases of the respiratory system, sex and types of infection and the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms, and also the relationship between the antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to collection of clinical specimens and the species and incidence of the bacterial isolates. in respiratory infections, it is frequently that chemotherapy should be instituted with an appropriate drug even before the causative organism can be identified and assessed for its antimicrobial susceptibility. the present data may provide valuable informations in selecting appropriate drugs in practical, clinical use.
pharmacokinetic and microbial susceptibility studies of ceftriaxone.
the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was tested  against 450 strains isolated from blood cultures and compared with that of various other antibiotics. the compound was comparable to cefotaxime for all species tested. it was more potent than cefoperazone, cefamandole and ticarcillin in inhibiting enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp. and serratia marcescens). the mic95 of ceftriaxone for these strains was 0.5 microgram/ml. the drug was less active against staphylococcus aureus than cefamandole, cloxacillin and vancomycin, but most isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftriaxone was comparable in activity to ticarcillin (mic95 = 64 micrograms/ml), and inferior to cefoperazone, ceftazidime and cefsulodine. levels of ceftriaxone in serum and various body fluids were determined by bio-assays. due to its very long half-life (8 h), ceftriaxone serum levels 24 h after i.v. or i.m. injection of 1 and 2 g were still above the mic95 of all strains tested except pseudomonas aeruginosa. levels in bile, synovial and cerebro-spinal fluids were high.
the turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 klett-summerson colorimeter units. the suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees c. turbidities for proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
[evaluation of in vitro antibacterial potencies of oral antibiotics against sputum isolates].
susceptibility of 162 sputum isolates to oral antibiotics was measured by an agar dilution method. the sputum isolates included s. pneumoniae 25 strains, s. aureus 30 strains, h. influenzae 37 strains, k. pneumoniae 51 strains and e. coli 19 strains. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of cefaclor (ccl), cephalexin (cex), ampicillin (abpc) and minocycline (mino) were measured for each strains. eighty percent of s. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at 0.024 to 0.05 micrograms/ml of abpc, 0.39 to 0.78 micrograms/ml of ccl, and 1.56 to 3.13 micrograms/ml of cex and mino. abpc, ccl and cex were considered to be effective clinically when they were used with the usual dosage. however, about 30% of strains were resistant to the usual dosage of orally administrated mino. eighty percent of s. aureus strains were inhibited at 0.20 to 0.39 microgram/ml of mino and 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml of the other 3 drugs. mino is the most effective with the usual dosage. twenty to 40% of strains showed resistance to ccl, cex and abpc. eighty percent of h. influenzae strains were inhibited at 0.39 micrograms/ml of abpc, 0.78 to 1.56 micrograms/ml of mino, 3.13 micrograms/ml of ccl and 12.5 to 25 micrograms/ml of cex. abpc should be selected as the first choice antibiotic. however, there were 2 abpc-resistant strains that were highly susceptible to ccl. eighty percent of k. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at 0.39 to 0.78 micrograms/ml of ccl, 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml of mino and cex, and 12.5 to 25 micrograms/ml of abpc. ccl seemed to be only effective oral antibiotic for k. pneumoniae infection.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. in this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (mic) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group a and b streptococci streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. klebsiella, enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
dc-52, a novel antitumor antibiotic. 1. taxonomy, fermentation and biological activity.
a novel antitumor antibiotic, dc-52 was found in the culture broths of actinomycete do-52. the producing organism was subsequently determined to be a new species and named streptomyces melanovinaceus nov. sp. for the production of the antibiotic, soluble starch served as a good carbon source and soybean meal was a good nitrogen source tested. the antibiotic dc-52 is active against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae, but not active against most gram-negative bacteria. the antibiotic is also active against mouse leukemia p388.
new broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. iii. synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
the influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (iii) was investigated. introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (iiif--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against proteus mirabilis. displacement of the acetoxy group of iiib with pyridines (iiim--p) enhanced the activity against p. aeruginosa and e. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin iiid having a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. as a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code no. sm-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
new broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. ii. synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[2-acylamino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3-[ (1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
the influence of the chirality of the 7-acyl side chain and of various n-acyl moieties (a-co-) on the in vitro activity of 7 beta-[2-acylamino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido ]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (6) was investigated. a cephalosporin having a 7-acyl side chain of s-configuration (6r) was only weakly active against staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae and was inactive against the other species tested. among the various n-acyl moieties in the cephalosporins having a 7-acyl side chain of the r-configuration, the 4-hydroxypyridine-3-carbonyl moiety, unsubstituted or substituted with 5-bromo and/or 6-alkyl groups and the 4-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridine-3-carbonyl moiety, unsubstituted or substituted with a 6-methyl and a 6-methoxy group gave the most active compounds. n-ethylation of the 4-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridine-3-carbonyl derivative and the 4-hydroxypyridine-3-carbonyl derivative (6p, 6q) resulted in a decrease of the in vitro activity.
[laboratory and clinical studies of t-1982 (cefbuperazone in pediatric field].
the authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of t-1982 (cefbuperazone). the results were as follows: the sensitivity was estimated by the plate dilution method on 28 strains of s. aureus 26 strains of e. coli, 27 strains of k. pneumoniae, 25 strains of s. marcescens and 14 strains of proteus sp. isolated from patients. the distribution of susceptibility of s. aureus was 1.25-25 micrograms/ml and the peak of distribution was 12.5 micrograms/ml. the strains of 84.6% of e. coli were inhibited at concentration of less than 0.39 micrograms/ml. the strains of 77.8% of k. pneumoniae were inhibited at concentration of less than 0.2 microgram/ml. the strains of 96% of s. marcescens was inhibited at concentration of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. the distribution of susceptibility of proteus sp. was 0.39-25 micrograms/ml. t-1982 was given to intravenous administration for 5 minutes and drip infusion for 30 minutes a single dose of 20 mg/kg of t-1982 to 2 and 2 children respectively. after intravenous administration of t-1982, the mean serum level was peak 88.4 +/- 8.7 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 52.5 +/- 2.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 4.6 +/- 0.15 micrograms/ml at 6 hours respectively. half-life was 89 minutes. and after drip infusion of t-1982, the mean serum level was 75.5 +/- 3.5 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes and 3.1 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml at 6.5 hours respectively. half-life was 82 minutes. the mean urinary excretion rate was 94.7%, 57.4 +/- 11.0% up to 6 hours after intravenous administration and drip infusion respectively. t-1982 was effective in 13 cases out of 13 cases with bacterial infections. no side effects were observed except for 1 case with elevation of serum got, 1 case with elevation of serum gpt and 2 cases with eosinophilia.
6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.
myeloperoxidase-mediated oxidation of methionine and amino acid decarboxylation.
the myeloperoxidase (mpo)-mediated decarboxylation of amino acids and the mpo-mediated oxidation of methionine, two potential bactericidal mechanisms, were compared. in the presence of the mpo system (mpo, 50 mu/ml; h(2)o(2), 0.1 mm; cl(-), 75 mm), 50% of alanine (0.1 mm) was decarboxylated, whereas only 5% of methionine (0.1 mm) was decarboxylated. in contrast, under similar conditions, 80% of methionine was oxidized to methionine sulfoxide. once methionine was oxidized to methionine sulfoxide, it was decarboxylated (75%) by the mpo system. methionine at 0.1 mm completely inhibited the decarboxylation of alanine, whereas alanine at a concentration 200 times that of methionine had no effect on the mpo-mediated oxidation of methionine. sodium azide, an mpo inhibitor, inhibited the decarboxylation of alanine and the oxidation of methionine to the same extent. tryptophan markedly inhibited the oxidation of methionine, whereas histidine stimulated it. alanine, glycine, and taurine had no effect. in contrast, all of these amino acids and taurine markedly inhibited the mpo-mediated decarboxylation of alanine. nan(3), tryptophan, and methionine, which inhibited the mpo-mediated oxidation of methionine, also inhibited the killing of staphylococcus aureus or klebsiella pneumoniae by the mpo system; whereas histidine, alanine, and glycine, which did not inhibit the oxidation of methionine, had less or no effect on the killing of these two bacteria by the mpo system. results suggest that methionine is preferentially oxidized to methionine sulfoxide by the mpo system. once methionine is oxidized to methionine sulfoxide, it is then readily decarboxylated by the mpo system. the agent responsible for the oxidation of methionine may play an important role in the mpo-mediated killing of bacteria.
[fundamental and clinical studies on ceftizoxime in pediatric field (author's transl)].
fundamental and clinical studies of ceftizoxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic,  in children led to the following results. 1. ceftizoxime compared favorably with cefazolin (cez) and cefmetazole (cmz) for in vitro activity against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus (31 strains), escherichia coli (29), klebsiella pneumoniae (30) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (16). while somewhat less active against s. aureus than cez and cmz, ceftizoxime was far more active than these 2 cephalosporin antibiotics against the test strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, which included strains resistant to the 2 drugs. ceftizoxime was not particularly active against ps. aeruginosa, but this seeming disadvantage was offset by the absolute ineffectiveness of the 2 reference drugs on this obstinate organism. 2. the time course of mean serum ceftizoxime levels in 3 pediatric patients of 5--10 years old given a single intravenous dose of 20 mg/kg was as follows: 45.4 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 40.4 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 22.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 10.4 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 2.9 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and 0.9 microgram/ml at 6 hours. the mean serum half life was 1.12 hours. the mean urinary levels of ceftizoxime at serial 2-hour collection intervals were as follows: 2,477 micrograms/ml for 1--2 hours, 1,235 micrograms/ml for 2--4 hours and 462 micrograms/ml for 4--6 hours. the mean urinary recovery up to 6 hours was 61.0%. 3. the clinical response of 28 children with infection to ceftizoxime treatment was 'excellent' in 22 children, 'good' in 4, and 'poor' in 2. these children comprised 11 with acute pneumonia, 3 with acute bronchitis, 4 with acute pyelonephritis, 2 each with acute purulent arthritis and acute enterocolitis, and 1 each with acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent lymphadenitis, furunculosis, subcutaneous abscess, subdural abscess and sepsis. the overall rate of effectiveness was 92.9%. successfully eradicated strains in the bacteriological sense consisted of 4 strains each of h. influenzae and e. coli, 1 strain each of p. morganii, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, 1 of the 2 strains of s. enteritidis, and 1 of the 3 strains of s. aureus. the overall rate of bacteriological effectiveness was 81.3%. no clinical side effects were observed. changes in laboratory test findings included slightly and transiently elevated got and gpt in 1 child and got alone in another child.
use of cefotaxime, a beta-lactamase stable cephalosporin, in the therapy of serious infections, including those due to multiresistant organisms.
cefotaxime is a cephalosporin active against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, proteus, and many pseudomonas and bacteroides fragilis--all but the latter two are inhibited at concentrations below 0.5 micrograms/ml. we evaluated cefotaxime as the sole therapy for 32 infections in 31 patients. infection sites included 18 bacteremias; pulmonary, urinary tract, deep tissue infections; and meningitis. clinical cures were achieved in 88 percent and bacteriologic cures in 86 percent of the patients--including those with infections due to organisms resistant to cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, carbenicillin and aminoglycosides; and in two patients with meningitis due to multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae. serum and cerebrospinal levels were readily maintained above the inhibitory levels of susceptible organisms. adverse reactions were minimal. cefotaxime was a safe, effective antibiotic in the treatment of infections due to susceptible organisms, including those resistant to other agents.
[about the antimicrobial activity of substituted aromatic aldehydes (author's transl)].
the mic-values and the antimicrobial activity in the paper disc diffusion method  of 86 resp. 79 substituted aromatic aldehydes have been investigated. antibacterial activity has been tested against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and klebsiella pneumoniae, the antifungal activity against trichophyton mentagrophytes, aspergillus niger and candida albicans. 13 classes of substituents have been investigated. the most active compounds are substituted with nitro-, hydroxy- and halogen groups.
ci-867, a new semisynthetic penicillin: in vitro studies.
ci-867, a new semisynthetic penicillin, has exhibited broad-spectrum activity in  vitro against gram-positive cocci, except penicillin g-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and against gram-negative bacilli. it was especially active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and as active as mezlocillin and piperacillin against klebsiella pneumoniae. ci-867 was bactericidal against most organisms. its activity was greatly reduced when the inoculum was increased from 10(5) to 10(7) organisms per ml.
comparative antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a, a derivative of fortimicin a.
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.
in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin g, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. all of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. more than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of staphylococcus aureus and 80% of s. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by n-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. it inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than ticarcillin. all 16 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. the marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it a promising new antibiotic.
heightened lung bactericidal activity in mice after aerosol immunization with re  595 salmonella minnesota: importance of cellular rather than humoral factors.
intrapulmonary bactericidal activity was enhanced against aerosolized serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus two weeks after aerosol immunization with re 595 salmonella minnesota. to define better this nonspecific stimulation of antibacterial lung defenses, mice were simultaneously challenged with s. aureus and s. marcescens up to 30 days after aerosol immunization with re. enhanced bactericidal activity against both organisms was noted, although activity against serratia was more pronounced during the first week after immunization. repetitive aerosol immunization with re also resulted in enhanced bactericidal activity. macrophages harvested from mice after aerosol immunization were "activated" by ultrastructural criteria and had enhanced intracellular bactericidal activity against s. aureus. aerosol immunization also caused an increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes in lung lavage fluid, which may have been important in activity against serratia. mice systemically immunized with re developed high antibody titers in serum and lung washings but had no stimulation of lung antibacterial activity.
[fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case, the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.
bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
the bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. no bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. the total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 candida albicans. of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. a higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. more isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. the rate of isolation staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and propionibacterium acnes increased, and the rate of isolation of escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.
antimicrobial activity of heparin.
single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. at heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 u/ml, the effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. all 10 isolates of s. aureus and all 10 of s. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 u/ml. three e. coli, four p. aeruginosa, and nine c. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 u of heparin per ml. none of the k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 u/ml. heparin inhibition of s. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 u of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. these data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
in vitro antibacterial activity of moxalactam, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic.
the antibacterial activity of moxalactam was studied in vitro against 229 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms using the agar dilution technique. mueller-hinton agar was used as growth medium. the results were compared to those obtained with cefamandole. all isolates of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by moxalactam at a concentration of 8 microgram/ml or less. the concentrations of cefamandole with which the same effect was obtained were 0.5 microgram/ml and 2 microgram/ml respectively. moxalactam was highly inhibitory against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus morganii - 90% of the strains were inhibited by 0.125 microgram/ml. moxalactam was highly superior against proteus rettgeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are usually resistant to cefamandole: the mic100 and mic90 were 0.25 microgram/ml and 8 microgram/ml respectively. high sensitivity was found in strains of salmonella species, nine of which were salmonella typhi: the mic90 was < 0.063 microgram/ml versus the eightfold higher concentration of cefamandole. the broad-spectrum activity and unusual mic patterns of moxalactam - eight or manyfold higher concentrations of cefamandole were needed to inhibit 90% of most gram-negative strains studied - make moxalactam an unusual and promising antibiotic.
[laboratory and clinical studies on cefuroxime (author's transl)].
the authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of cefuroxime (cxm). the results were as follows: the sensitivity was measured by plate dilution method on 26 strains of s. aureus, 22 strains of e. coli and 24 strains of k. pneumoniae isolated from patients. the distribution of sensitivity of s. aureus was 0.78 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml and the peak of distribution was 1.56 micrograms/ml. the distribution of sensitivity of e. coli was 1.56 approximately 50 micrograms/ml and the peak was 6.25 micrograms/ml. the growth of 79.2% k. pneumoniae was inhibited in concentration of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. cxm was given intravenously for 30 minutes at a single dose of 20 mg/kg to 3 children. the serum mean levels of cxm were 99.0 +/- 10.6 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 18.0 +/- 10.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 7.0 +/- 2.0, 2.2 +/- 0.6, 0.79 +/- 0.2 microgram/ml at 2, 4 and 6 hours after drip infusion for 30 minutes, respectively. mean half life was 48 minutes. the mean urinary recovery rate was 96.2% up to 8 hours after administration. cxm was effective in 9 of 10 cases of bacterial infections. no side effect was observed except for 1 case with elevation of serum transaminase.
in vitro activity of hr 756, a new cephalosporin compound.
the in vitro activity of hr 756, a new cephalosporin, has been determined against recent clinical isolates and compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the geometric means of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for different isolates of escherichia coli (100 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (84), pseudomonas aeruginosa (121), proteus mirabilis (52), indole-positive proteus species (9), salmonella species (19), staphylococcus aureus penicillin-sensitive (29) and penicillin-resistant (39) were: 0.095, 0.124, 11.1, 0.095, 0.0107, 0.078, 1 and 0.95 mcg/ml, respectively. its activity was affected by rise in inoculum against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa but not against k. pneumoniae and e. coli. bactericidal activity was determined by membrane filtration method. hr 756 was found to be bactericidal to e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and proteus species. although the mics of the tested s. aureus strains were 1 mcg/ml, 5 mcg/ml of hr 756 failed to kill 99% of the inoculum within 24 hours.
activity of 5-episisomicin compared with that of other aminoglycosides.
5-episisomicin, a semisynthetic aminoglycoside, has been shown to inhibit many members of the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. at a concentration of 3.1 mug/ml, more than 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, citrobacter, indole-positive proteus, and providencia were inhibited. 5-episisomicin had activity against s. aureus, e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, and citrobacter similar to gentamicin and netilmicin. it had activity similar to amikacin and netilmicin against many gentamicin-resistant bacteria. the activity of 5-episisomicin was greatest at an alkaline ph and in medium of low magnesium content. synergy of 5-episisomicin and carbenicillin was found to occur most often against pseudomonas.
determinants of lung bacterial clearance in mice after acute hypoxia.
net lung bacterial clearance in normal mice is determined by the balance of in vivo bacterial multiplication on the one hand, and the defense mechanisms of mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis and killing by the oxygen-dependent alveolar macrophage on the other. the bactericidal function of the macrophage is the major component of the defense mechanism. the effect of acute hypoxia on the defense mechanism was studied in mice exposed to aerosols of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. physical clearance was not impaired by acute hypoxia, and bacterial replication was not stimulated by the low oxygen atmosphere. clearance of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli was impaired during acute hypoxia due to decreased phagocytosis or killing by the alveolar macrophage. the important human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae was cleared normally in the presence of acute hypoxia. this observation suggests that an oxygen-independent clearance mechanism is important in lung defense against the pneumococcus. this may be a separate mechanism within the alveolar macrophage or a system as yet unidentified.
synthesis and biological activity of some new furan quaternary salts.
a series of new n-(5-substituted 2-furfuryl)-n,n-dimethyl-n-aryloxyalkyl quaternary ammonium salts relating to general structure iv has been synthesized by reacting 5-substituted 2-(n,n-dimethylaminomethyl)furans iia-d with appropriate aryloxyalkyl bromides iii. the resulting compounds are tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity. a simpler synthesis of 5-nitro-2-(n,n-dimethylaminomethyl)furan (iid) involving the reduction of n,n-dimethyl-5-nitro-2-furamide (ib) with diborane is described. a new compound, 5-bromo-2-(n,n-dimethylaminomethyl)furnan (iic), is prepared in a similar way. many of these compounds (22, 28, 34, 37-42, 44, and 45) indicate high activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and are more active than nitrofurantoin, compounds 22, 34 and 41 exhibit the highest in vitro antibacterial activity in the series. some of these quaternary salts (22, 25, 37, 37-41, and 60) possess appreciable activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv. none of these compounds show significant antifungal activity. eight compounds (18, 21, 22, 26-28, 32, and 34) have high in vitro antibacterial activity were inactive when tested for anthelmintic activity in rats against nippostrongylus brasiliensis and hymenolepis nana.
in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics in patients of cefamandole, a new cephalsoporin antibiotic.
cefamandole nafate, a new cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro against 231 recent clinical isolates and in 12 patients. cefamandole had activity equivalent to cefazolin against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin or cefazolin against proteus mirabilis. both cefamandole and cefazolin were as active as cephalothin against s. aureus, were slightly more active against k. pneumoniae, and were considerably more active against e. coli. all strains of indole-positive proteus sp. were inhibited by 6.3 mug of cefamandole per ml but only 20% were inhibited by 25 mug of cefazolin or cephalothin per ml. eighty-eight percent of enterobacter sp. was inhibited by 25 mug of cefamandole per ml, but only 20 and 5% were inhibited by the same concentration of cefazolin and cephalothin, respectively. peak levels of cefamandole ranged from 6.0 to 110 mug/ml in serum and levels ranged from 440 to 16,800 mug/ml in a 4- to 6-h collection of urine after a 500-mg or 1-g intramuscular dose (6.1 to 17.3 mg/kg) in patients with endogenous creatinine clearances of >/=31 ml/min. these levels were done after the first dose, at mid-therapy, and at the end of therapy. there was no evidence of accumulation with the 500-mg or 1-g dose given every 4 to 6 h. the percentage of the dose excreted in the urine within the first 4 to 6 h after administration of cefamandole was >/=43%. the half-life of cefamandole in serum was 49 to 126 min.
evaluation of antibacterial activities of cephalosporin antibiotics: cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalexin.
the antibacterial activities of 4 cephalosporin antibiotics, cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin, against 330 isolates of bacteria from patients at national taiwan university hospital, were determined by an agar plate dilution technique. cephalosporins possess strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria except enterococci. staphylococcus aureus is the most susceptible among the organisms tested. more than 90% of staphylococcus aureus strains are suppressed by cefazolin, cephaloridine and cephalothin at the concentrations of 3.13 mug/ml or less, except that 49.1% are suppressed by cephalexin. the relative potency of cephalosporins against staphylococcus aureus in decreasing order is cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. the gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis are less susceptible to cephalosporins than the gram-positive cocci. among the cephalosporins, cefazolin is the most active against the gram-negative pathogens tested. the relative potency of antibacterial activity of cephalosporins against e. coli in decreasing order is cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cephalothin. one hour after the intramuscular injection of 500 mg of cefazolin, the maximum concentration of 33.3 mug/ml is reached in the serum. the sufficient high levels are sustained for 8 hours. very high concentrations of cefazolin are also found in the urine.
the effects of staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae peritonitis in mice exposed to normal and hypoxic conditions on red cell oxygen transport function.
normal mice exposed to 10% oxygen concentration developed a slight but statistically significant decrease in blood ph and a slight statistically insignificant decrease in red cell 2,3-dpg. mice that were infected intraperitoneally with staphylococcus aureus or klebsiella pneumoniae and exposed to 20% oxygen developed acidosis, hemoconcentration, and decreased red cell 2,3-dpg levels. when mice with acute bacterial peritonitis were exposed to 10% oxygen concentration they likewise developed significant acidosis and hemoconcentration, but their reduction in red cell 2,3-dpg was not as great as that in the similarly infected mice exposed to 20% oxygen concentration.
treatment of pneumonia and other serious bacterial infections with cephapirin.
nineteen patients with pneumonia due to streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus  aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, or escherichia coli were treated with 4 to 18 g of cephapirin daily. there were three treatment failures. one patient each with pneumonia due to e. coli or s. pneumoniae died despite apparent eradication of the pathogen. lobar pneumonia due to k. pneumoniae progressed during therapy in a third patient to lung gangrene, necessitating pneumonectomy. five additional patients with pneumococcal pericarditis or septic bursitis, empyema, cannula-associated bacteremia, and thoractomy wound infection due to s. aureus were cured. all isolates of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and group a streptococcus were inhibited by 0.8 mug of cephapirin per ml; minimal inhibitory concentrations of cephalothin were similar. ninety percent of k. pneumoniae, 85% of proteus mirabilis, 73% of e. coli, and 30% of enterobacter were inhibited by 12.5 mug cephapirin per ml. all isolates of pseudomonas, serratia and indole-positive proteus had a cephapirin minimal inhibitory concentration of [formula: see text] 100 mug/mg. serum concentrations after intravenous and intramuscular injection were similar to those reported for cephalothin. the intramuscular injections were moderately painful, and intravenous infusions caused phlebitis in three of nine patients treated with doses up to 18 g per day. cephapirin appears comparable to cephalothin in vitro and is an effective agent in treatment of infection due to s. aureus and s. pneumoniae.
cefamandole, a cephalosporin antibiotic with an unusually wide spectrum of activity.
the in vitro activity of cefamandole, 7-d-mandelamido-3-(1 methyl-1h-tetrazol-5 yethiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid, was investigated. the majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. activity against staphylococcus aureus was below that of cephalothin, but most strains were inhibited by 0.4 mug/ml. enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. cefamandole was very active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae, with 70% of escherichia coli, 86% of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 88% of proteus mirabilis inhibited by 1.6 mug/ml. a number of enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens strains were inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. pseudomonas species were resistant. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin, cephaloridine, or cephalexin against members of the enterobacteriaceae. inoculum size and type of medium had variable effects on the minimal inhibitory concentration, depending upon the particular strain tested. strains of enterobacter, serratia, indole-positive proteus species showed the greatest inoculum effect. similarly, these species showed a several-fold difference of bactericidal and inhibitory levels. resistance of cefamandole to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamase played a partial role in its activity, but some strains that hydrolyzed the agent were susceptible.
in vitro evaluation of tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic.
one hundred fifty-two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella-enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 mug of tobramycin/ml in a broth-dilution method and showed zones of inhibition of 16 mm or more around a 10-mug tobramycin disc in the kirby-bauer method. tobramycin was most active against s. aureus, 100% of strains being inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. all strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and indole-positive proteus species, and 80% of enterobacter species were inhibited by 0.8 mug of tobramycin/ml, whereas only 48% of p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by this concentration. tobramycin was approximately twice as active as gentamicin against s. aureus, four times as active against p. aeruginosa, slightly more active against e. coli and enterobacter species, equally active against p. mirabilis, and slightly less active against k. pneumoniae. the minimal bactericidal concentrations of tobramycin and gentamicin were the same as or twice the minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains except those of p. aeruginosa, against which greater concentrations of both gentamicin and tobramycin were required for bactericidal activity. tobramycin sterilized cultures of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa, but the rate of bactericidal action was faster with a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin than with either antibiotic alone in the same concentrations. tobramycin retained potency in the presence of 200 to 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml for at least 6 hr of incubation at 37 c, but lost potency in the presence of 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml by 24 hr of incubation and in the presence of 800 mug/ml by 2 hr of incubation.
clinical and in vitro evaluation of cephapirin, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
cephapirin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and in 27 patients. cephapirin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against 25 strains each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus; 10 strains each of diplococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas species, and enterobacter species; and 8 strains of proteus species other than p. mirabilis. all strains of s. aureus and d. pneumoniae and most strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and proteus species were inhibited by concentrations of cephapirin achieved in the serum. of 27 patients (20 with pneumonia, 2 with s. aureus empyema, and 5 with miscellaneous infections), 25 responded to cephapirin therapy. the only major toxicity thought to be drug-related occurred in a patient who developed reversible bone marrow depression with leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. although cephapirin was painful on intramuscular injection, phlebitis and pain were absent in patients treated intravenously. in a controlled comparison of intravenously administered cephalothin and cephapirin in four additional patients, the latter caused much less pain than the former and caused no phlebitis.
in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephalexin, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin c antibiotic.
concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. the in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. all strains of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. of the staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all s. aureus, 80% of escherichia coli, 72% of klebsiella-aerobacter, and 56% of proteus mirabilis strains. about 90 to 96% of e. coli, klebsiella aerobacter, and p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. a peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. a mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. food did not interfere with absorption. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. over 90% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 6 hr. the mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group a streptococci, d. pneumoniae, and s. aureus, 85% of e. coli, and about 40 to 75% of klebsiella-aerobacter and p. mirabilis strains. levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of e. coli, and p. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of klebsiella-aerobacter strains.
in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. the in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. all strains of group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes) and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. eighty per cent of the staphylococcus aureus strains and about 50% of the escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. klebsiella-aerobacter species were more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. when single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. a full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. the peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group a streptococci and d. pneumoniae. many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. mirabilis. urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the e. coli and p. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of klebsiella-aerobacter.
