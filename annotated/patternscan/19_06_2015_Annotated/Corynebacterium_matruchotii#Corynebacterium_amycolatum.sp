TI  == [antibiotic resistance of coryneform bacteria isolated from the reproductive tract of women].
AB  == the species composition, antilysozyme activity and antibiotic resistance of coryneform bacteria, isolated from the reproductive tract of women with microecological disturbances, were studied. sixty six women without microecological disturbances and 102 female patients with microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract were examined. the study showed that corynebacterium minutissimum, c. amycolatum, c. group jk, c. bovis and c. pseudodiphtheriticum prevailed in the healthy women. in the patients with microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract c. vitarumen, c. matruchotii, c. striatum, c. renale and c. urealyticum were detected in addition  to the above species. the average antilysozyme activity of the coryneform bacteria isolated from the healthy women was 1.32 +/- 0.47. in the patients with  microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract it was 1.84 +/- 0.38. the  in vitro susceptibility of the coryneform bacteria to antimicrobial agents was determined. high prevalence of resistance to beta-lactams (oxacillin and penicillin), erythromycin and co-trimoxazole was detected. thus, the species variety and the antilysozyme activity of the coryneform bacteria in the reproductive tract of the women with microecological disturbances were found to be higher. the high prevalence of resistance to oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin and co-trimoxazole in the coryneform bacteria isolated from the patients with the microecological disturbances did not differ from that in the healthy women.
