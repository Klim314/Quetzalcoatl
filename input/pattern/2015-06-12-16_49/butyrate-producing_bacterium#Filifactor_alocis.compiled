TI  - Degradation of arginine and other amino acids by butyrate-producing asaccharolytic anaerobic Gram-positive rods in periodontal pockets.
AB  - The use of 20 amino acids by butyrate-producing asaccharolytic anaerobic Gram-positive rods (AAGPRs) in periodontal pockets, i.e. Eubacterium minutum, Filifactor alocis, E. infirmum, E. sulci and E. saphenum, was studied. E. minutum used only arginine and lysine, and produced substantial amounts of butyrate and ammonia as the main metabolic products from arginine, and acetate, butyrate and ammonia from lysine. Fi. alocis used arginine alone and produced butyrate and ammonia. E. infirmum, E. sulci and E. saphenum used lysine alone and produced acetate, butyrate and ammonia. The growth of these bacterial species was supported and enhanced by arginine and/or lysine enriched to culture media, but not by the other amino acids. Arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase and carbamate kinase activity were detected in the cell-free extract of E. minutum, suggesting that arginine was metabolised to citrulline initially, and subsequently to ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate. Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate were further converted to butyrate, and carbon dioxide and ammonia, respectively. Enzymatic activity of arginine deiminase and ornithine carbamoyltransferase was not detected in Fi. alocis, indicating that Fi. alocis converted arginine to ornithine directly, not via citrulline, and further to butyrate.
