TI  == tackling the bottleneck in bacterial signal transduction research: high-throughput identification of signal molecules.
AB  == signal transduction processes are typically initiated by the interaction of signal molecules with sensor domains. the current lack of information on the signal molecules that feed into regulatory circuits forms a major bottleneck that hampers the understanding of regulatory processes. mckellar et al. report a high-throughput approach for the identification of signal molecules, which is based on thermal shift assays of recombinant sensor domains in the absence and presence of compounds from commercially available ligand collections. initial binding studies with the sensor domain of the pcta chemoreceptor of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a close match between thermal shift assay results and microcalorimetric studies reported previously. using thermal shift assays the authors then identify signals that bind to three chemoreceptors of the kiwifruit  pathogen p. syringae pv. actinidiae nz-v13. microcalorimetric binding studies and chemotaxis assays have validated the relevance of these ligands. the power of this technique lies in the combination of a high-throughput analytical tool with  commercially available compound collections. the approach reported is universal since it can be employed to identify signal molecules to any type of sensor domain. there is no doubt that this technique will facilitate the identification  of many signal molecules in future years.

TI  == dirhamnose-lipid production by recombinant nonpathogenic bacterium pseudomonas chlororaphis.
AB  == we previously discovered that pseudomonas chlororaphis nrrl b-30761 produces monorhamnolipids (r1ls) with predominantly 3-hydroxydodecenoyl-3-hydroxydecanoate (c12:1-c10) or 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-3-hydroxydecanoate (c12-c10) as the lipid moiety under static growth conditions only. we have now cloned, sequenced, and analyzed in silico the gene locus of nrrl b-30761 containing the putative coding  sequences of rhamnosyltransferase chain a (rhla pch , 894 bps), rhamnosyltransferase chain b (rhlb pch , 1272 bps), and n-acyl-homoserine lactone-dependent transcriptional regulatory protein (rhlr pch , 726 bps). the putative gene products rhlapch (297 amino acid residues or a.a.), rhlbpch (423 a.a.), and rhlrpch (241 a.a.) only have between 60 and 65 % a.a. identities to their respective closest matched homologs in p. aeruginosa. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based assay did not detect the presence of rhamnosyltransferase c  gene (rhlc) in p. chlororaphis, suggesting a genetic basis for the lack of dirhamnose-lipid (r2l) synthesis in this organism. we thus genetically constructed an r2l-synthesizing p. chlororaphis by expressing a rhamnosyltransferase c (rhlc) gene of p. aeruginosa using an expression vector (pbs29-p2-gfp) containing a pseudomonas syringae promoter. the r2l/r1l ratio is 2.4 in the rhamnolipid (rl) sample isolated from the genetically engineered (ge)  p. chlororaphis [pbs29-p2-rhlc], in contrast to undetectable r2l in the ge p. chlororaphis [pbs29-p2-gfp] control cells based on lc-ms analysis. the critical micelle concentrations of the r2l and r1l samples from ge p. chlororaphis [pbs29-p2-rhlc] and the control [pbs29-p2-gfp] cells were ca. 0.1 mm, and their minimum surface tensions were ca. 26 mn/m with no significant difference.

TI  == a high-throughput screen for ligand binding reveals the specificities of three amino acid chemoreceptors from pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae.
AB  == chemoreceptors play a central role in chemotaxis, allowing bacteria to detect chemical gradients and bias their swimming behavior in order to navigate toward favorable environments. the genome of the kiwifruit pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (psa) strain nz-v13 encodes 43 predicted chemoreceptors,  none of which has been characterized. we developed a high-throughput fluorescence-based thermal shift assay for identifying the signal molecules that  are recognized by a given chemoreceptor ligand binding domain (lbd). using this assay, we characterized the ligand binding profiles of three psa homologs of the  p. aeruginosa pao1 amino acid chemoreceptors pcta, pctb and pctc. each recombinant lbd was screened against 95 potential ligands. the three psa homologs, named psca, pscb and pscc (psa chemoreceptors a, b and c) bound 3, 10 and 3 amino acids respectively. in each case, their binding profiles were distinct from their p. aeruginosa pao1 homologs. notably, psa psca-lbd only bound the acidic amino acids l-aspartate, d-aspartate and l-glutamate, whereas p. aeruginosa pcta-lbd binds all of the l-proteinogenic amino acids except for l-aspartate and l-glutamate. a combination of homology modeling, site-directed mutagenesis and functional screening identified a single amino acid residue in the psa psca-lbd (ala146) that is critically important for determining its narrow specificity.

TI  == diversity of small rnas expressed in pseudomonas species.
AB  == rna sequencing (rna-seq) has revealed several hundreds of previously undetected small rnas (srnas) in all bacterial species investigated, including strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas syringae. nonetheless, only little is known about the extent of conservation of expressed srnas across strains and species. in this study, we have used rna-seq to identify srnas in p.  putida dot-t1e and pseudomonas extremaustralis 14-3b. this is the first strain of p. extremaustralis and the second strain of p. putida to have their transcriptomes analysed for srnas, and we identify the presence of around 150 novel srnas in each strain. furthermore, we provide a comparison based on sequence conservation of all the srnas detected by rna-seq in the pseudomonas species investigated so far. our results show that the extent of srna conservation across different species is very limited. in addition, when comparing the srnas expressed in different strains of the same species, we observe that numerous srnas exhibit a strain-specific expression pattern. these results support the idea that the evolution of most bacterial srnas is rapid, which limits the extent of both interspecies and intraspecies conservation.

TI  == the c-di-gmp phosphodiesterase bifa is involved in the virulence of bacteria from the pseudomonas syringae complex.
AB  == in a recent screen for novel virulence factors involved in the interaction between pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi and the olive tree, a mutant was selected that contained a transposon insertion in a putative cyclic diguanylate (c-di-gmp) phosphodiesterase-encoding gene. this gene displayed high similarity to bifa of pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. here, we examined the role of bifa in free-living and virulence-related phenotypes of two bacterial plant pathogens in the pseudomonas syringae complex, the tumour-inducing pathogen of woody hosts, p. savastanoi pv. savastanoi ncppb 3335, and the pathogen of tomato and arabidopsis, p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000. we showed that deletion of the bifa gene resulted in decreased swimming motility of both bacteria and inhibited swarming motility of dc3000. in contrast, overexpression of bifa in p.  savastanoi pv. savastanoi had a positive impact on swimming motility and negatively affected biofilm formation. deletion of bifa in ncppb 3335 and dc3000  resulted in reduced fitness and virulence of the microbes in olive (ncppb 3335) and tomato (dc3000) plants. in addition, real-time monitoring of olive plants infected with green fluorescent protein (gfp)-tagged p. savastanoi cells displayed an altered spatial distribution of mutant deltabifa cells inside olive  knots compared with the wild-type strain. all free-living phenotypes that were altered in both deltabifa mutants, as well as the virulence of the ncppb 3335 deltabifa mutant in olive plants, were fully rescued by complementation with p. aeruginosa bifa, whose phosphodiesterase activity has been demonstrated. thus, these results suggest that p. syringae and p. savastanoi bifa are also active phosphodiesterases. this first demonstration of the involvement of a putative phosphodiesterase in the virulence of the p. syringae complex provides confirmation of the role of c-di-gmp signalling in the virulence of this group of plant pathogens.

TI  == draft genome sequence analysis of a pseudomonas putida w15oct28 strain with antagonistic activity to gram-positive and pseudomonas sp. pathogens.
AB  == pseudomonas putida is a member of the fluorescent pseudomonads known to produce the yellow-green fluorescent pyoverdine siderophore. p. putida w15oct28, isolated from a stream in brussels, was found to produce compound(s) with antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic pathogens staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae, an unusual characteristic for p. putida. the active compound production only occurred in media with low iron content and without organic nitrogen sources. transposon mutants which lost their antimicrobial activity had the majority of insertions in genes involved in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine, although purified pyoverdine was not responsible for the antagonism. separation of compounds present in culture supernatants revealed the presence of two fractions containing highly hydrophobic molecules active against p. aeruginosa. analysis of the draft genome  confirmed the presence of putisolvin biosynthesis genes and the corresponding lipopeptides were found to contribute to the antimicrobial activity. one cluster  of ten genes was detected, comprising a nad-dependent epimerase, an acetylornithine aminotransferase, an acyl coa dehydrogenase, a short chain dehydrogenase, a fatty acid desaturase and three genes for a rnd efflux pump. p.  putida w15oct28 genome also contains 56 genes encoding tonb-dependent receptors,  conferring a high capacity to utilize pyoverdines from other pseudomonads. one unique feature of w15oct28 is also the presence of different secretion systems including a full set of genes for type iv secretion, and several genes for type vi secretion and their vgrg effectors.

TI  == nudc nudix hydrolase from pseudomonas syringae, but not its counterpart from pseudomonas aeruginosa, is a novel regulator of intracellular redox balance required for growth, motility and biofilm formation.
AB  == nudix pyrophosphatases, ubiquitous in all organisms, have not been well studied.  recent implications that some of them may be involved in response to stress and in pathogenesis indicate that they play important biological functions. we have investigated nudc nudix proteins from the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato str. dc3000 and from the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1161. we found that these homologous enzymes are homodimeric and in vitro preferentially hydrolyse nadh. the p. syringae mutant strain deficient in nudc accumulated nadh  and displayed significant defects in growth, motility and biofilm formation. the  wild type copy of the nudc gene with its cognate promoter delivered in trans into the nudc mutant restored its fitness. however, introduction of the p. syringae nudc gene under the control of the strong tacp promoter into either p. syringae or p. aeruginosa cells had a toxic effect on both strains. opposite to p. syringae nudc, the p. aeruginosa nudc deficiency as well as its overproduction had no visible impact on cells. moreover, p. aeruginosa nudc does not compensate  the lack of its counterpart in the p. syringae mutant. these results indicate that nudc from p. syringae, but not from p. aeruginosa is vital for bacteria.

TI  == analysis of the draft genome of pseudomonas fluorescens atcc17400 indicates a capacity to take up iron from a wide range of sources, including different exogenous pyoverdines.
AB  == all fluorescent pseudomonads (pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. putida, p. fluorescens,  p. syringae and others) are known to produce the high-affinity peptidic yellow-green fluorescent siderophore pyoverdine. these siderophores have peptide  chains that are quite diverse and more than 50 pyoverdine structures have been elucidated. in the majority of the cases, a pseudomonas species is also able to produce a second siderophore of lower affinity for iron. pseudomonas fluorescens  atcc 17400 has been shown to produce a unique second siderophore, (thio)quinolobactin, which has an antimicrobial activity against the phytopathogenic oomycete pythium debaryanum. we show that this strain has the capacity to utilize 16 different pyoverdines, suggesting the presence of several  ferripyoverdine receptors. analysis of the draft genome of p. fluorescens atcc 17400 confirmed the presence of 55 tonb-dependent receptors, the largest so far for pseudomonas, among which 15 are predicted to be ferripyoverdine receptors (fpv). phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two different clades containing ferripyoverdine receptors, with sequences similar to the p. aeruginosa type ii fpva forming a separate cluster. among the other receptors we confirmed the presence of the qbsi (thio)quinolobactin receptor, an ferri-achromobactin and an ornicorrugatin receptor, several catecholate and four putative heme receptors. twenty five of the receptors genes were found to be associated with genes encoding extracytoplasmic sigma factors (ecf sigma) and transmembrane anti-sigma  sensors.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae evades host immunity by degrading flagellin monomers with alkaline protease apra.
AB  == bacterial flagellin molecules are strong inducers of innate immune responses in both mammals and plants. the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes an alkaline protease called apra that degrades flagellin monomers. here, we show that apra is widespread among a wide variety of bacterial species. in addition, we investigated the role of apra in virulence of the bacterial plant pathogen p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000. the apra-deficient dc3000 deltaapra knockout mutant was significantly less virulent on both tomato and arabidopsis thaliana. moreover, infiltration of a. thaliana col-0 leaves with dc3000 deltaapra evoked a significantly higher level of expression of the defense-related genes frk1 and pr-1 than did wild-type dc3000. in the flagellin receptor mutant fls2, pathogen virulence and defense-related gene activation did  not differ between dc3000 and dc3000 deltaapra. together, these results suggest that apra of dc3000 is important for evasion of recognition by the fls2 receptor, allowing wild-type dc3000 to be more virulent on its host plant than apra-deficient dc3000 deltaapra. to provide further evidence for the role of dc3000 apra in host immune evasion, we overexpressed the apra inhibitory peptide  apri of dc3000 in a. thaliana to counteract the immune evasive capacity of dc3000 apra. ectopic expression of apri in a. thaliana resulted in an enhanced level of  resistance against wild-type dc3000, while the already elevated level of resistance against dc3000 deltaapra remained unchanged. together, these results indicate that evasion of host immunity by the alkaline protease apra is important for full virulence of strain dc3000 and likely acts by preventing flagellin monomers from being recognized by its cognate immune receptor.

TI  == identification of bacteriophages for biocontrol of the kiwifruit canker phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae is a reemerging pathogen which causes bacterial canker of kiwifruit (actinidia sp.). since 2008, a global outbreak of p. syringae pv. actinidiae has occurred, and in 2010 this pathogen was detected in new zealand. the economic impact and the development of resistance in p. syringae pv. actinidiae and other pathovars against antibiotics and copper sprays have led to a search for alternative management strategies. we isolated 275 phages, 258 of which were active against p. syringae pv. actinidiae. extensive host range testing on p. syringae pv. actinidiae, other pseudomonads, and bacteria isolated from kiwifruit orchards showed that most phages have a narrow host range. twenty-four were analyzed by electron microscopy, pulse-field gel electrophoresis, and restriction digestion. their suitability for biocontrol was  tested by assessing stability and the absence of lysogeny and transduction. a detailed host range was performed, phage-resistant bacteria were isolated, and resistance to other phages was examined. the phages belonged to the caudovirales  and were analyzed based on morphology and genome size, which showed them to be representatives of myoviridae, podoviridae, and siphoviridae. twenty-one myoviridae members have similar morphologies and genome sizes yet differ in restriction patterns, host range, and resistance, indicating a closely related group. nine of these myoviridae members were sequenced, and each was unique. the  most closely related sequenced phages were a group infecting pseudomonas aeruginosa and characterized by phages jg004 and pak_p1. in summary, this study reports the isolation and characterization of p. syringae pv. actinidiae phages and provides a framework for the intelligent formulation of phage biocontrol agents against kiwifruit bacterial canker.

TI  == development of genomic tools for the identification of certain pseudomonas up to  species level.
AB  == pseudomonas is a highly versatile bacterium at the species level with great ecological significance. these genetically and metabolically diverse species have undergone repeated taxonomic revisions. we propose a strategy to identify pseudomonas up to species level, based on the unique features of their 16s rdna (rrs) gene sequence, such as the frame work of sequences, sequence motifs and restriction endonuclease (re) digestion patterns. a species specific phylogenetic framework composed of 31 different rrs sequences, allowed us to segregate 1,367 out of 2,985 rrs sequences of this genus, which have been classified at present only up to genus (pseudomonas) level, as follows: p. aeruginosa (219 sequences),  p. fluorescens (463 sequences), p. putida (347 sequences), p. stutzeri (197 sequences), and p. syringae (141 sequences). these segregations were validated by unique 30-50 nucleotide long motifs and re digestion patterns in their rrs. a single gene thus provides multiple makers for identification and surveillance of  pseudomonas.

TI  == catalytic mechanism and mode of action of the periplasmic alginate epimerase algg.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that forms chronic biofilm infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. a major component of the biofilm during these infections is the exopolysaccharide alginate, which is synthesized at the inner membrane as a homopolymer of 1-4-linked beta-d-mannuronate. as the polymer passages through the periplasm, 22-44% of the  mannuronate residues are converted to alpha-l-guluronate by the c5-epimerase algg to produce a polymer of alternating beta-d-mannuronate and alpha-l-guluronate blocks and stretches of polymannuronate. to understand the molecular basis of alginate epimerization, the structure of pseudomonas syringae algg has been determined at 2.1-a resolution, and the protein was functionally characterized. the structure reveals that algg is a long right-handed parallel beta-helix with an elaborate lid structure. functional analysis of algg mutants suggests that his(319) acts as the catalytic base and that arg(345) neutralizes the acidic group during the epimerase reaction. water is the likely catalytic acid. electrostatic surface potential and residue conservation analyses in conjunction  with activity and substrate docking studies suggest that a conserved electropositive groove facilitates polymannuronate binding and contains at least  nine substrate binding subsites. these subsites likely align the polymer in the correct register for catalysis to occur. the presence of multiple subsites, the electropositive groove, and the non-random distribution of guluronate in the alginate polymer suggest that algg is a processive enzyme. moreover, comparison of algg and the extracellular alginate epimerase alge4 of azotobacter vinelandii  provides a structural rationale for the differences in their ca(2+) dependence.

TI  == transcriptomics-based screen for genes induced by flagellin and repressed by pathogen effectors identifies a cell wall-associated kinase involved in plant immunity.
AB  == background: microbe-associated molecular patterns, such as those present in bacterial flagellin, are powerful inducers of the innate immune response in plants. successful pathogens deliver virulence proteins, termed effectors, into the plant cell where they can interfere with the immune response and promote disease. engineering the plant immune system to enhance disease resistance requires a thorough understanding of its components. results: we describe a high-throughput screen, using rna sequencing and virus-induced gene silencing, to identify tomato genes whose expression is enhanced by the flagellin microbe-associated molecular pattern flgii-28, but reduced by activities of the pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (pst) type iii effectors avrpto and avrptob. gene ontology terms for this category of flagellin-induced repressed by effectors (fire) genes showed enrichment for genes encoding certain subfamilies of protein  kinases and transcription factors. at least 25 of the fire genes have been implicated previously in plant immunity. of the 92 protein kinase-encoding fire genes, 33 were subjected to virus-induced gene silencing and their involvement in pattern-triggered immunity was tested with a leaf-based assay. silencing of one fire gene, which encodes the cell wall-associated kinase slwak1, compromised the  plant immune response resulting in increased growth of pst and enhanced disease symptoms. conclusions: our transcriptomic approach identifies fire genes that represent a pathogen-defined core set of immune-related genes. the analysis of this set of candidate genes led to the discovery of a cell wall-associated kinase that participates in plant defense. the fire genes will be useful for further elucidation of the plant immune system.

TI  == biodegradation of low density polythene (ldpe) by pseudomonas species.
AB  == low density polythene (ldpe) is the most widely used packaging material primarily because of its excellent mechanical properties, barrier properties against water, light weight, low cost and high energy effectiveness. however, due to its ubiquitous nature, and resistance to biodegradability, the disposal strategies are crucial and need attention. recently, microorganisms have become the focus of interest for environmental friendly disposal of plastic and polymer-based waste.  this manuscript aims to investigate the extent of biodegradability of ldpe by four different strains of pseudomonas bacteria-pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 (atcc  15729), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 15692), pseudomonas putida (kt2440 atcc 47054) and pseudomonas syringae (dc3000 atcc 10862). degradation of ldpe was determined by weight loss of the sample, morphological changes, mechanical and spectroscopic variations. the eluted compounds after degradation were analysed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. our results show that pseudomonas spp. can degrade ldpe films.

TI  == structure of microcin b-like compounds produced by pseudomonas syringae and species specificity of their antibacterial action.
AB  == escherichia coli microcin b (ec-mcb) is a posttranslationally modified antibacterial peptide containing multiple oxazole and thiazole heterocycles and targeting the dna gyrase. we have found operons homologous to the ec-mcb biosynthesis-immunity operon mcb in recently sequenced genomes of several pathovars of the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae, and we produced two variants of p. syringae microcin b (ps-mcb) in e. coli by heterologous expression. like ec-mcb, both versions of ps-mcb target the dna gyrase, but unlike ec-mcb, they are active against various species of the pseudomonas genus,  including human pathogen p. aeruginosa. through analysis of ec-mcb/ps-mcb chimeras, we demonstrate that three centrally located unmodified amino acids of ps-mcb are sufficient to determine activity against pseudomonas, likely by allowing specific recognition by a transport system that remains to be identified. the results open the way for construction of mcb-based antibacterial  molecules with extended spectra of biological activity.

TI  == comparative genomics of multiple strains of pseudomonas cannabina pv. alisalensis, a potential model pathogen of both monocots and dicots.
AB  == comparative genomics of closely related pathogens that differ in host range can provide insights into mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions and host adaptation. furthermore, sequencing of multiple strains with the same host range  reveals information concerning pathogen diversity and the molecular basis of virulence. here we present a comparative analysis of draft genome sequences for four strains of pseudomonas cannabina pathovar alisalensis (pcal), which is pathogenic on a range of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. these draft  genome sequences provide a foundation for understanding host range evolution across the monocot-dicot divide. like other phytopathogenic pseudomonads, pcal strains harboured a hrp/hrc gene cluster that codes for a type iii secretion system. phylogenetic analysis based on the hrp/hrc cluster genes/proteins, suggests localized recombination and functional divergence within the hrp/hrc cluster. despite significant conservation of overall genetic content across pcal  genomes, comparison of type iii effector repertoires reinforced previous molecular data suggesting the existence of two distinct lineages within this pathovar. furthermore, all pcal strains analyzed harbored two distinct genomic islands predicted to code for type vi secretion systems (t6sss). while one of these systems was orthologous to known p. syringae t6sss, the other more closely  resembled a t6ss found within p. aeruginosa. in summary, our study provides a foundation to unravel pcal adaptation to both monocot and dicot hosts and provides genetic insights into the mechanisms underlying pathogenicity.

TI  == wide screening of phage-displayed libraries identifies immune targets in planta.
AB  == microbe-associated molecular patterns and virulence effectors are recognized by plants as a first step to mount a defence response against potential pathogens. this recognition involves a large family of extracellular membrane receptors and  other immune proteins located in different sub-cellular compartments. we have used phage-display technology to express and select for arabidopsis proteins able to bind bacterial pathogens. to rapidly identify microbe-bound phage, we developed a monitoring method based on microarrays. this combined strategy allowed for a genome-wide screening of plant proteins involved in pathogen perception. two phage libraries for high-throughput selection were constructed from cdna of plants infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa pa14, or from combined samples of the virulent isolate dc3000 of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and its avirulent variant avrrpt2. these three pathosystems represent different degrees in the specificity of plant-microbe interactions. libraries cover up to 2 x 10(7) different plant transcripts that can be displayed as functional proteins on the surface of t7 bacteriophage. a number of these were selected in a bio-panning assay for binding to pseudomonas cells. among the selected clones we isolated the ethylene response factor aterf-1, which was able to bind the three bacterial strains in competition assays. aterf-1 was rapidly exported from the nucleus upon infiltration of either alive or heat-killed pseudomonas. moreover, aterf-1 mutants exhibited enhanced susceptibility to infection. these findings suggest that aterf-1 contains a microbe-recognition domain with a role in plant defence.  to identify other putative pathogen-binding proteins on a genome-wide scale, the  copy number of selected-vs.-total clones was compared by hybridizing phage cdnas  with arabidopsis microarrays. microarray analysis revealed a set of 472 candidates with significant fold change. within this set defence-related genes, including well-known targets of bacterial effectors, are over-represented. other  genes non-previously related to defence can be associated through this study with general or strain-specific recognition of pseudomonas.

TI  == crcz and crcx regulate carbon source utilization in pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato strain dc3000.
AB  == small non-coding rnas (ncrnas) are important components of many regulatory pathways in bacteria and play key roles in regulating factors important for virulence. carbon catabolite repression control is modulated by small rnas (crcz  or crcz and crcy) in pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida. in this study, we demonstrate that expression of crcz and crcx (formerly designated psr1  and psr2, respectively) is dependent upon rpon together with the two-component system cbrab, and is influenced by the carbon source present in the medium in the model plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc3000. the distribution of the members of the crc ncrna family was also determined by screening available genomic sequences of the pseudomonads. interestingly, variable numbers of the crc family members exist in pseudomonas genomes. the ncrnas are comprised of three main subfamilies, named crcz, crcx and crcy. most importantly the crcx subfamily  appears to be unique to all p. syringae strains sequenced to date.

TI  == virulence factor regulator (vfr) controls virulence-associated phenotypes in pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 6605 by a quorum sensing-independent mechanism.
AB  == virulence factor regulator (vfr) is a member of the cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (camp) receptor proteins that regulate the expression of many important virulence genes in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the role of vfr in pathogenicity has not been elucidated fully in phytopathogenic bacteria. to investigate the function of vfr in pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 6605, the vfr  gene was disrupted. the virulence of the vfr mutant towards host tobacco plants was attenuated significantly, and the intracellular camp level was decreased. the vfr mutant reduced the expression of flagella-, pili- and type iii secretion system-related genes and the defence response in nonhost arabidopsis leaves. furthermore, the expression levels of achromobactin-related genes and the iron uptake ability were decreased, suggesting that vfr regulates positively these virulence-related genes. in contrast, the vfr mutant showed higher tolerance to antimicrobial compounds as a result of the enhanced expression of the resistance-nodulation-division family members, the mexa, mexb and oprm genes. we  further demonstrated that the mutant strains of vfr and cyaa, an adenylate cyclase gene responsible for camp synthesis, showed a similar phenotype, suggesting that vfr regulates virulence factors in a camp-dependent manner. because there was no significant difference in the production of acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) quorum sensing molecules in the wild-type, vfr and cyaa mutant strains, vfr might control important virulence factors by an ahl-independent mechanism in an early stage of infection by this bacterium.

TI  == characterization of molecular mechanisms controlling fabab transcription in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background: the fabab pathway is one of the unsaturated fatty acid (ufa) synthesis pathways for pseudomonas aeruginosa. it was previously noted that this  operon was upregulated in biofilms and repressed by exogenous ufas. deletion of a 30 nt faba upstream sequence, which is conserved in p. aeruginosa, p. putida, and p. syringae, led to a significant decrease in faba transcription, suggesting positive regulation by an unknown positive regulatory mechanism. methods/principal findings: here, genetic and biochemical approaches were employed to identify a potential fabab activator. deletion of candidate genes such as pa1611 or pa1627 was performed to determine if any of these gene products act as a fabab activator. however, none of these genes were involved in the regulation of fabab transcription. use of mariner-based random mutagenesis to screen for faba activator(s) showed that several genes encoding unknown functions, rpon and desa may be involved in faba regulation, but probably via indirect mechanisms. biochemical attempts performed did fail to isolate an activator of fabab operon. conclusion/significance: the data suggest that faba expression might not be regulated by protein-binding, but by a distinct mechanism such as a regulatory rna-based mechanism.

AB  == fosfomycin is a wide-spectrum antibiotic that is used clinically to treat acute cystitis in the united states. the compound is produced by several strains of streptomycetes and pseudomonads. we sequenced the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for fosfomycin production in pseudomonas syringae pb-5123. surprisingly, the biosynthetic pathway in this organism is very different from that in streptomyces fradiae and streptomyces wedmorensis. the pathways share the first and last steps, involving conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate (pnpy) and 2-hydroxypropylphosphonate (2-hpp) to fosfomycin, respectively, but the enzymes converting pnpy to 2-hpp are different. the genome  of p. syringae pb-5123 lacks a gene encoding the pnpy decarboxylase found in the  streptomyces strains. instead, it contains a gene coding for a citrate synthase-like enzyme, psf2, homologous to the proteins that add an acetyl group to pnpy in the biosynthesis of fr-900098 and phosphinothricin. heterologous expression and purification of psf2 followed by activity assays confirmed the proposed activity of psf2. furthermore, heterologous production of fosfomycin in  pseudomonas aeruginosa from a fosmid encoding the fosfomycin biosynthetic cluster from p. syringae pb-5123 confirmed that the gene cluster is functional. therefore, two different pathways have evolved to produce this highly potent antimicrobial agent.

TI  == effect of overexpressing rsma from pseudomonas aeruginosa on virulence of select  phytotoxin-producing strains of p. syringae.
AB  == the gacs/gaca two-component system functions mechanistically in conjunction with  global post-transcriptional regulators of the rsma family to allow pseudomonads and other bacteria to adapt to changing environmental stimuli. analysis of this gac/rsm signal transduction pathway in phytotoxin-producing pathovars of pseudmonas syringae is incomplete, particularly with regard to rsma. our approach in studying it was to overexpress rsma in p. syringae strains through introduction of psk61, a plasmid constitutively expressing this gene. disease and colonization of plant leaf tissue were consistently diminished in all p. syringae strains tested (pv. phaseolicola nps3121, pv. syringae b728a, and br2r) when harboring psk61 relative to these isolates harboring the empty vector pme6031. phaseolotoxin, syringomycin, and tabtoxin were not produced in any of these strains when transformed with psk61. production of protease and pyoverdin as well as swarming were also diminished in all of these strains when harboring psk61. in contrast, alginate production, biofilm formation, and the hypersensitive response were diminished in some but not all of these isolates under the same growth conditions. these results indicate that rsma is consistently important in the overarching phenotypes disease and endophtyic colonization but that its role varies with pathovar in certain underpinning phenotypes in the phytotoxin-producing strains of p. syringae.

TI  == characterization of each aefr and mext mutant in pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci  6605.
AB  == to investigate the mechanism of activation of the genes for resistance-nodulation-division (rnd) family members mexe, mexf, and oprn for multidrug resistance (mdr), we mutagenized aefr and mext, the potential regulators of mexef/oprn transcription in pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 6605 (pta 6605). aefr is a member of the tetr transcription factors, and is known to be required for production of the quorum-sensing molecules, acyl homoserine lactones (ahl), in p. syringae. furthermore, we found that ahl-synthesis-defective mutant strains in pta 6605 showed enhanced expression of  mexef/oprn, and were highly tolerant to antimicrobial compounds such as chloramphenicol. mext is a lysr-type transcription factor and is known to positively regulate transcription of mexef/oprn in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the aefr mutant reduced the amount of growth in in vitro culture, caused the loss of  ahl production, reduced the swarming motility, virulence and expression of psyi (ahl synthase) and psyr (ahl transcriptional regulator), and enhanced mexef/oprn  expression and tolerance to chloramphenicol, whereas the mext mutant retained the ability to produce ahl and did not show remarkable changes in in vitro growth, tolerance to antimicrobial compounds or virulence. furthermore, unlike p. aeruginosa, the expression of mexef/oprn is independent of mext. these results indicate that (1) aefr is a regulator for the quorum-sensing system and mdr, and  is required for swarming motility and virulence toward the host tobacco plant, and (2) mext is not involved in the expression of mexef/oprn in this bacterium.

TI  == novel genes involved in pseudomonas fluorescens pf0-1 motility and biofilm formation.
AB  == adna in pseudomonas fluorescens, an ortholog of fleq in p. aeruginosa, regulates  both motility and flagellum-mediated attachment to various surfaces. a whole-genome microarray determined the adna transcriptome by comparing the gene expression pattern of wild-type pf0-1 to that of pf0-2x (adna deletion mutant) in broth culture. in the absence of adna, expression of 92 genes was decreased, while 11 genes showed increased expression. analysis of 16 of these genes fused to lacz confirmed the microarray results. several genes were further evaluated for their role in motility and biofilm formation. two genes, pfl01_1508 and pfl01_1517, affected motility and had different effects on biofilm formation in pf0-1. these two genes are predicted to specify proteins similar to the glycosyl  transferases fgta1 and fgta2, which have been shown to be involved in virulence and motility in p. syringae. three other genes, pfl01_1516, pfl01_1572, and pfl01_1573, not previously associated with motility and biofilm formation in pseudomonas had similar effects on biofilm formation in pf0-1. deletion of each of these genes led to different motility defects. our data revealed an additional level of complexity in the control of flagellum function beyond the core genes known to be required and may yield insights into processes important for environmental persistence of p. fluorescens pf0-1.

TI  == complex formation between heme oxygenase and phytochrome during biosynthesis in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato.
AB  == the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato carries two genes encoding bacterial phytochromes. sequence motifs identify both proteins (pstbphp1 and pstbphp2, respectively) as biliverdin ixalpha (bv)-binding phytochromes. pstbphp1 is arranged in an operon with a heme oxygenase (pstbpho)-encoding gene (pstbpho), whereas pstbphp2 is flanked downstream by a gene encoding a chey-type response regulator. expression of the heme oxygenase pstbpho yielded a green protein (lambda(max) = 650 nm), indicative for bound bv. heterologous expression of pstbphp1 and pstbphp2 and in vitro assembly with bv ixalpha yielded the apoproteins for both phytochromes, but only in the case of pstbphp1 a light-inducible chromoprotein. attempts to express the endogenous heme oxygenase  bpho and either of the two phytochromes from two plasmids yielded only holo-pstbphp1. relatively small amounts of soluble holo-pstbphp2 were just obtained upon co-expression with bpho from p. aeruginosa. expression of the operon containing pstbpho:pstbphp1 led to an improved yield and better photoreactivity for pstbphp1, whereas an identical construct, exchanging pstbphp1 for pstbphp2 (pstbpho:pstbphp2), again yielded only minute amounts of chromophore-loaded bphp2-holoprotein. the improved yield for pstbphp1 from the pstbpho:pstbphp1 operon expression is apparently caused by complex formation between both proteins during biosynthesis as affinity chromatography of either protein using two different tags always co-purified the reaction partner. these results support the importance of protein-protein interactions during tetrapyrrole metabolism and phytochrome assembly.

TI  == pseudomonad swarming motility is restricted to a narrow range of high matric water potentials.
AB  == using a novel experimental system that allows control of the matric potential of  an agar slab, we explored the hydration conditions under which swarming motility  is possible. if there is recognition that this physical parameter is a key determinant of swarming, it is usually neither controlled nor measured rigorously but only manipulated through proxies, namely, the agar concentration and the drying time of "soft" agar plates (swarming plates). we contend that this not only obscures the biophysical mechanisms underlying swarming but also impedes a full assessment of its clinical and environmental significances. our results indicate that swarming motility is restricted to a narrow range of high matric water potentials in the three pseudomonads tested (pseudomonas sp. dss73, pseudomonas syringae b728a, and pseudomonas aeruginosa pa14). the threshold below which no swarming was observed was about -0.45 kpa for the first and about -0.1 kpa for the latter two. above the threshold, the expansion rate of dss73 swarms increased exponentially with the matric potential. mutants deficient in surfactant production were totally or partially unable to expand rapidly on the surface of the agar slab. our results thus suggest that swarming motility in pseudomonads is restricted to (micro)sites where ambient humidity is very high (relative humidity of >99.99%). the spatiotemporal occurrence of such sites is limited in many types of terrestrial environments.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae coordinates production of a motility-enabling surfactant with flagellar assembly.
AB  == using a sensitive assay, we observed low levels of an unknown surfactant produced by pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae b728a that was not detected by traditional methods yet enabled swarming motility in a strain that exhibited deficient production of syringafactin, the main characterized surfactant produced by p. syringae. random mutagenesis of the syringafactin-deficient strain revealed an acyltransferase with homology to rhla from pseudomonas aeruginosa that was required for production of this unidentified surfactant, subsequently characterized by mass spectrometry as 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy) alkanoic acid (haa). analysis of other mutants with altered surfactant production revealed that haa is coordinately regulated with the late-stage flagellar gene encoding flagellin; mutations in genes involved in early flagellar assembly abolish or reduce haa production, while mutations in flagellin or flagellin glycosylation genes increase its production. when colonizing a hydrated porous surface, the bacterium increases production of both flagellin and haa. p. syringae was defective in porous-paper colonization without functional flagella and was slightly inhibited in this movement when it lacked surfactant production. loss of haa production in a syringafactin-deficient strain had no effect on swimming but  abolished swarming motility. in contrast, a strain that lacked haa but retained syringafactin production exhibited broad swarming tendrils, while a syringafactin-producing strain that overproduced haa exhibited slender swarming tendrils. on the basis of further analysis of mutants altered in haa production,  we discuss its regulation in pseudomonas syringae.

TI  == inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence: characterization of the apra-apri interface and species selectivity.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes the virulence factor alkaline protease (apra) to  enhance its survival. apra cleaves one of the key microbial recognition molecules, monomeric flagellin, and thereby diminishes toll-like receptor 5 activation. in addition, apra degrades host proteins such as complement proteins  and cytokines. p. aeruginosa encodes a highly potent inhibitor of alkaline protease (apri) that is solely located in the periplasm where it is presumed to protect periplasmic proteins against secreted apra. we set out to study the enzyme-inhibitor interactions in more detail in order to provide a basis for future drug development. structural and mutational studies reveal that the conserved n-terminal residues of apri occupy the protease active site and are essential for inhibitory activity. we constructed peptides mimicking the n-terminus of apri; however, these were incapable of inhibiting apra-mediated flagellin cleavage. furthermore, we expressed and purified apri of p. aeruginosa  and the homologous (37% sequence identity) apri of pseudomonas syringae, which remarkably show species specificity for their cognate protease. exchange of the first five n-terminal residues between apri of p. syringae and p. aeruginosa did  not affect the observed specificity, whereas exchange of only six residues located at the apri surface that contacts the protease did abolish specificity. these findings are elementary steps toward the design of molecules derived from the natural inhibitor of the virulence factor apra and their use in therapeutic applications in pseudomonas and other gram-negative infections.

TI  == two small rnas, crcy and crcz, act in concert to sequester the crc global regulator in pseudomonas putida, modulating catabolite repression.
AB  == the crc protein is a translational repressor that recognizes a specific target at some mrnas, controlling catabolite repression and co-ordinating carbon metabolism in pseudomonads. in pseudomonas aeruginosa, the levels of free crc protein are controlled by crcz, a srna that sequesters crc, acting as an antagonist. we show  that, in pseudomonas putida, the levels of free crc are controlled by crcz and by a novel 368 nt srna named crcy. crcz and crcy, which contain six potential targets for crc, were able to bind crc specifically in vitro. the levels of crcz  and crcy were low under conditions generating a strong catabolite repression, and increased strongly when catabolite repression was absent. deletion of either crcz or crcy had no effect on catabolite repression, but the simultaneous absence of both srnas led to constitutive catabolite repression that compromised growth on some carbon sources. overproduction of crcz or crcy significantly reduced repression. we propose that crcz and crcy act in concert, sequestering and modulating the levels of free crc according to metabolic conditions. the cbra/cbrb two-component system activated crcz transcription, but had little effect on crcy. crcy was detected in p. putida, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas syringae, but not in p. aeruginosa.

TI  == phosphorylcholine phosphatase: a peculiar enzyme of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes phosphorylcholine phosphatase (pchp) when grown on choline, betaine, dimethylglycine or carnitine. in the presence of mg(2+) or zn(2+), pchp catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphate (p-npp) or phosphorylcholine (pcho). the regulation of pchp gene expression is under the  control of gbdr and ntrc; dimethylglycine is likely the metabolite directly involved in the induction of pchp. therefore, the regulation of choline metabolism and consequently pchp synthesis may reflect an adaptive response of p. aeruginosa to environmental conditions. bioinformatic and biochemistry studies shown that pchp contains two sites for alkylammonium compounds (aacs): one in the catalytic site near the metal ion-phosphoester pocket, and another in an inhibitory site responsible for the binding of the alkylammonium moiety. both sites could be close to each other and interact through the residues (42)e, (43)e and (82)yyy(84). zn(2+) is better activator than mg(2+) at ph 5.0 and it is more  effective at alleviating the inhibition produced by the entry of pcho or different aacs in the inhibitory site. we postulate that zn(2+) induces at ph 5.0 a conformational change in the active center that is communicated to the inhibitory site, producing a compact or closed structure. however, at ph 7.4, this effect is not observed because to the hydrolysis of the [zn(2+)l(2) (-1)l(2) (0)(h(2)o)(2)] complex, which causes a change from octahedral to tetrahedral in the metal coordination geometry. this enzyme is also present in p. fluorescens, p. putida, p. syringae, and other organisms. we have recently crystallized pchp and solved its structure.

TI  == regulation of type vi secretion gene clusters by sigma54 and cognate enhancer binding proteins.
AB  == type vi secretion systems (t6ss) are bacteriophage-derived macromolecular machines responsible for the release of at least two proteins in the milieu, which are thought to form an extracellular appendage. although several t6ss have  been shown to be involved in the virulence of animal and plant pathogens, clusters encoding these machines are found in the genomes of most species of gram-negative bacteria, including soil, marine, and environmental isolates. t6ss  have been associated with several phenotypes, ranging from virulence to biofilm formation or stress sensing. their various environmental niches and large diversity of functions are correlated with their broad variety of regulatory mechanisms. using a bioinformatic approach, we identified several clusters, including those of vibrio cholerae, aeromonas hydrophila, pectobacterium atrosepticum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, and a marinomonas sp., which possess typical -24/-12 sequences, recognized by the alternate sigma factor sigma 54 (sigma(54) or sigma(n)). sigma(54), which directs the rna polymerase to these promoters, requires the action of a bacterial enhancer binding protein (bebp), which binds to cis-acting upstream activating sequences. putative bebps are encoded within the t6ss gene clusters possessing sigma(54) boxes. using in vitro binding experiments and in vivo reporter fusion assays, we showed that the expression of these clusters is dependent on both sigma(54) and bebps.

TI  == pa0305 of pseudomonas aeruginosa is a quorum quenching acylhomoserine lactone acylase belonging to the ntn hydrolase superfamily.
AB  == the pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 genome has at least two genes, pvdq and quip, encoding acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) acylases. two additional genes, pa1893 and  pa0305, have been predicted to encode penicillin acylase proteins, but have not been characterized. initial studies on a pa0305 transposon insertion mutant suggested that the gene is not related to the ahl growth phenotype of p. aeruginosa. the close similarity (67 %) of pa0305 to hacb, an ahl acylase of pseudomonas syringae, prompted us to investigate whether the pa0305 protein might also function as an ahl acylase. the pa0305 gene has been cloned and the protein  (pa0305) has been overproduced, purified and subjected to functional characterization. analysis of the purified protein showed that, like beta-lactam  acylases, pa0305 undergoes post-translational processing resulting in alpha- and  beta-subunits, with the catalytic serine as the first amino acid of the beta-subunit, strongly suggesting that pa0305 is a member of the n-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily. using a biosensor assay, pa0305his was shown to degrade ahls with acyl side chains ranging in length from 6 to 14 carbons. kinetics studies using n-octanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (c(8)-hsl) and n-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-c(12)-hsl) as substrates showed  that the enzyme has a robust activity towards these two ahls, with apparent k(cat)/k(m) values of 0.14 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1) towards c(8)-hsl and 7.8 x 10(4) m(-1 )s(-1) towards 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl. overexpression of the pa0305 gene in p. aeruginosa showed significant reductions in both accumulation of 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl  and expression of virulence factors. a mutant p. aeruginosa strain with a deleted pa0305 gene showed a slightly increased capacity to kill caenorhabditis elegans compared with the p. aeruginosa pao1 wild-type strain and the pao1 strain carrying a plasmid overexpressing pa0305. the harmful effects of the deltapa0305  strain on the animals were most visible at 5 days post-exposure and the mortality rate of the animals fed on the deltapa0305 strain was faster than for the animals fed on either the wild-type strain or the strain overexpressing pa0305. in conclusion, the pa0305 gene encodes an efficient acylase with activity towards long-chain homoserine lactones, including 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl, the natural quorum sensing signal molecule in p. aeruginosa, and we propose to name this acylase hacb.

AB  == members of the genus pseudomonas inhabit a wide variety of environments, which is reflected in their versatile metabolic capacity and broad potential for adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions. here, we examine and compare  the genomes of a range of pseudomonas spp. encompassing plant, insect and human pathogens, and environmental saprophytes. in addition to a large number of allelic differences of common genes that confer regulatory and metabolic flexibility, genome analysis suggests that many other factors contribute to the diversity and adaptability of pseudomonas spp. horizontal gene transfer has impacted the capability of pathogenic pseudomonas spp. in terms of disease severity (pseudomonas aeruginosa) and specificity (pseudomonas syringae). genome  rearrangements likely contribute to adaptation, and a considerable complement of  unique genes undoubtedly contributes to strain- and species-specific activities by as yet unknown mechanisms. because of the lack of conserved phenotypic differences, the classification of the genus has long been contentious. dna hybridization and genome-based analyses show close relationships among members of p. aeruginosa, but that isolates within the pseudomonas fluorescens and p. syringae species are less closely related and may constitute different species. collectively, genome sequences of pseudomonas spp. have provided insights into pathogenesis and the genetic basis for diversity and adaptation.

AB  == an issue of critical concern in microbiology is the ability to detect viable but  nonculturable (vbnc) and viable-culturable (vc) cells by methods other than existing approaches. culture methods are selective and underestimate the real population, and other options (direct viable count and the double-staining method using epifluorescence microscopy and inhibitory substance-influenced molecular methods) are also biased and time-consuming. a rapid approach that reduces selectivity, decreases bias from sample storage and incubation, and reduces assay time is needed. flow cytometry is a sensitive analytical technique that can rapidly monitor physiological states of bacteria. this report outlines a method to optimize staining protocols and the flow cytometer (fcm) instrument settings for the enumeration of vbnc and vc bacterial cells within 70 min. experiments were performed using the fcm to quantify vbnc and vc escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium cells after staining with different fluorescent probes: syto 9, syto  13, syto 17, syto 40, and propidium iodide (pi). the fcm data were compared with  those for specific standard nutrient agar to enumerate the number of cells in different states. by comparing results from cultures at late log phase, 1 to 64%  of cells were nonculturable, 40 to 98% were culturable, and 0.7 to 4.5% had damaged cell membranes and were therefore theoretically dead. data obtained using four different gram-negative bacteria exposed to heat and stained with pi also illustrate the usefulness of the approach for the rapid and unbiased detection of dead versus live organisms.

TI  == the acylase pvdq has a conserved function among fluorescent pseudomonas spp.
AB  == pyoverdine biosynthesis in fluorescent pseudomonas spp. and especially in the opportunistic human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa has been extensively studied. the acylase pvdq is required for a maturation step in pyoverdine biosynthesis but also has been proven to be effective in degrading long-chain n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls). these molecules are used as quorum-sensing molecules by gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonads themselves. interestingly, the pvdq gene is part of a pyoverdine cluster in p. aeruginosa and p. syringae but not in  other fluorescent pseudomonas spp. in this study we have compared the activities  of pvdq orthologues from various species and provide evidence for conserved functions in pseudomonas fluorescens pfo-1, p. putida kt2440 and p. aeruginosa pa14. despite large differences in genomic organization, expression of each of these pvdq orthologues is regulated by iron availability. moreover, pvdq and its  orthologues have conserved substrate specificity for ahls and play a role in pyoverdine production in all tested pseudomonas species. these data strongly suggest that the role of pvdq in pyoverdine biosynthesis is conserved among pseudomonas spp., while the control that pvdq exerts in p. aeruginosa over its own quorum-sensing signals seems to be unique to this bacterium.

AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae b728a is a resident on leaves of common bean, where it utilizes several well-studied virulence factors, including secreted effectors and toxins, to develop a pathogenic interaction with its host. the b728a genome was recently sequenced, revealing the presence of 1,297 genes with unknown function. this study demonstrates that a 29.9-kb cluster of genes in the  b728a genome shares homology to the novel type vi secretion system (t6ss) locus recently described for other gram-negative bacteria. western blot analyses showed that b728a secretes hcp, a t6ss protein, in culture and that this secretion is dependent on clpv, a gene that likely encodes an aaa(+) atpase. in addition, we have identified two b728a sensor kinases that have homology to the p. aeruginosa  proteins rets and lads. we demonstrate that b728a rets and lads reciprocally regulate the t6ss and collectively modulate several virulence-related activities. quantitative pcr analyses indicated that rets and lads regulate genes associated  with the type iii secretion system and that lads controls the expression of genes involved in the production of the exopolysaccharides alginate and levan. these analyses also revealed that lads and the hybrid sensor kinase gacs positively regulate the expression of a putative novel exopolysaccharide called psl. plate assays demonstrated that rets negatively controls mucoidy, while lads negatively  regulates swarming motility. a mutation in rets affected b728a population levels  on the surfaces of bean leaves. a model for the lads and rets control of b728a virulence activities is proposed.

TI  == novel functions of stomatal cytokinesis-defective 1 (scd1) in innate immune responses against bacteria.
AB  == eukaryotes employ complex immune mechanisms for protection against microbial pathogens. here, we identified scd1 (stomatal cytokinesis-defective 1), previously implicated in growth and development through its role in cytokinesis and polarized cell expansion (falbel, t. g., koch, l. m., nadeau, j. a., segui-simarro, j. m., sack, f. d., and bednarek, s. y. (2003) development 130, 4011-4024) as a novel component of innate immunity. in arabidopsis, scd1 is a unique gene encoding for the only protein containing a complete denn (differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells) domain. the denn domain is a largely uncharacterized tripartite protein motif conserved among eukaryotic  proteins. we show that conditional scd1-1 plants containing a point mutation in a conserved denn residue affected a subset of signaling responses to some bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps). consistent with increased transcript accumulation of pathogen-related (pr) genes, scd1-1 plants were more resistant to pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (pst) dc3000 infection implicating scd1 as a negative regulator of basal resistance against bacteria. scd1-1 plants were different from known mutants exhibiting constitutive expressor of pr (cpr)-like phenotypes, in that growth impairment of scd1-1 plants was genetically independent of constitutive immune response activation. for scd1-1, shift to elevated temperature or introduction of a mutant allele in salicylic acid induction-deficient 2 (sid2) suppressed constitutive defense response activation. sid2-2 also repressed the resistance phenotype of scd1-1. temperature shift and sid2-2, however, did not rescue conditional growth and sterility defects of scd1-1. these results implicate scd1 in multiple cellular pathways, possibly by affecting different proteins. overall, our studies identified a novel role for eukaryotic denn proteins in immunity against bacteria.

TI  == iron uptake and metabolism in pseudomonads.
AB  == pseudomonads are ubiquitous gram-negative gamma proteobacteria known for their extreme versatility and adaptability. some are plant pathogens (pseudomonas syringae) which have to survive on the surface of leaves while others can colonize the rhizosphere or survive in soil (pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida), and one species, pseudomonas entomophila, is an insect pathogen. the most investigated species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, is known to be an opportunistic pathogen able to infect plants, nematodes, insects, and mammals, including humans. like for other bacteria, iron is a key nutrient for pseudomonads. the fluorescent pseudomonads produce siderophores, the best known being the fluorescent high-affinity peptidic pyoverdines. often diverse secondary siderophores of lower affinity are produced as well (pyochelin, pseudomonin, corrugatins and ornicorrugatins, yersiniabactin, and thioquinolobactin). reflecting their large capacity of adaptation to changing environment and niche colonization, pseudomonads are able to obtain their iron from heme or from siderophores produced by other microorganisms (xenosiderophores) via the expression of outer membrane tonb-dependent receptors. as expected, iron uptake is exquisitely and hierarchically regulated in these bacteria. in this short review, the diversity of siderophores produced, receptors, and finally the way iron homeostasis is regulated in p. aeruginosa, p. syringae, p. putida, and p. fluorescens, will be presented and, when possible, put in relation with the lifestyle and the ecological niche.

TI  == dna sequence-based analysis of the pseudomonas species.
AB  == partial sequences of four core 'housekeeping' genes (16s rrna, gyrb, rpob and rpod) of the type strains of 107 pseudomonas species were analysed in order to obtain a comprehensive view regarding the phylogenetic relationships within the pseudomonas genus. gene trees allowed the discrimination of two lineages or intrageneric groups (ig), called ig p. aeruginosa and ig p. fluorescens. the first ig p. aeruginosa, was divided into three main groups, represented by the species p. aeruginosa, p. stutzeri and p. oleovorans. the second ig was divided into six groups, represented by the species p. fluorescens, p. syringae, p. lutea, p. putida, p. anguilliseptica and p. straminea. the p. fluorescens group was the most complex and included nine subgroups, represented by the species p. fluorescens, p. gessardi, p. fragi, p. mandelii, p. jesseni, p. koreensis, p. corrugata, p. chlororaphis and p. asplenii. pseudomonas rhizospherae was affiliated with the p. fluorescens ig in the phylogenetic analysis but was independent of any group. some species were located on phylogenetic branches that were distant from defined clusters, such as those represented by the p. oryzihabitans group and the type strains p. pachastrellae, p. pertucinogena and p. luteola. additionally, 17 strains of p. aeruginosa, 'p. entomophila', p. fluorescens, p. putida, p. syringae and p. stutzeri, for which genome sequences have been determined, have been included to compare the results obtained in the analysis of four housekeeping genes with those obtained from whole genome analyses.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae strains naturally lacking the classical p. syringae hrp/hrc  locus are common leaf colonizers equipped with an atypical type iii secretion system.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae is best known as a plant pathogen that causes disease by translocating immune-suppressing effector proteins into plant cells through a type iii secretion system (t3ss). however, p. syringae strains belonging to a newly described phylogenetic subgroup (group 2c) are missing the canonical p. syringae hrp/hrc cluster coding for a t3ss, flanking effector loci, and any close orthologue of known p. syringae effectors. nonetheless, p. syringae group 2c strains are common leaf colonizers and grow on some tested plant species to population densities higher than those obtained by other p. syringae strains on nonhost species. moreover, group 2c strains have genes necessary for the production of phytotoxins, have an ice nucleation gene, and, most interestingly,  contain a novel hrp/hrc cluster, which is only distantly related to the canonical p. syringae hrp/hrc cluster. this hrp/hrc cluster appears to encode a functional  t3ss although the genes hrpk and hrps, present in the classical p. syringae hrp/hrc cluster, are missing. the genome sequence of a representative group 2c strain also revealed distant orthologues of the p. syringae effector genes avre1  and hopm1 and the p. aeruginosa effector genes exou and exoy. a putative life cycle for group 2c p. syringae is discussed.

TI  == the atp-binding cassette transporter cbc (choline/betaine/carnitine) recruits multiple substrate-binding proteins with strong specificity for distinct quaternary ammonium compounds.
AB  == we identified a choline, betaine and carnitine transporter, designated cbc, from  pseudomonas syringae and pseudomonas aeruginosa that is unusual among members of  the atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter family in its use of multiple periplasmic substrate-binding proteins (sbps) that are highly specific for their  substrates. the sbp encoded by the cbcxwv operon, cbcx, binds choline with a high affinity (k(m), 2.6 microm) and, although it also binds betaine (k(m), 24.2 microm), cbcxwv-mediated betaine uptake did not occur in the presence of choline. the cbcx orthologue chox from sinorhizobium meliloti was similar to cbcx in these binding properties. the core transporter cbcwv also interacts with the carnitine-specific sbp caix (k(m), 24 microm) and the betaine-specific sbp betx (k(m), 0.6 microm). unlike most abc transporter loci, caix, betx and cbcxwv are separated in the genome. caix-mediated carnitine uptake was reduced by cbcx and betx only when they were bound by their individual ligands, providing the first in vivo evidence for a higher affinity for ligand-bound than ligand-free sbps by  an abc transporter. these studies demonstrate not only that the cbc transporter serves as a useful model for exploring abc transporter component interactions, but also that the orphan sbp genes common to bacterial genomes can encode functional sbps.

TI  == the siderophore pyoverdine of pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 6605 is an intrinsic virulence factor in host tobacco infection.
AB  == to investigate the role of iron uptake mediated by the siderophore pyoverdine in  the virulence of the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 6605, three predicted pyoverdine synthesis-related genes, pvdj, pvdl, and fpva, were mutated. the pvdj, pvdl, and fpva genes encode the pyoverdine side chain peptide synthetase iii l-thr-l-ser component, the pyoverdine chromophore synthetase, and  the tonb-dependent ferripyoverdine receptor, respectively. the delta pvdj and delta pvdl mutants were unable to produce pyoverdine in mineral salts-glucose medium, which was used for the iron-depleted condition. furthermore, the delta pvdj and delta pvdl mutants showed lower abilities to produce tabtoxin, extracellular polysaccharide, and acyl homoserine lactones (ahls), which are quorum-sensing molecules, and consequently had reduced virulence on host tobacco  plants. in contrast, all of the mutants had accelerated swarming ability and increased biosurfactant production, suggesting that swarming motility and biosurfactant production might be negatively controlled by pyoverdine. scanning electron micrographs of the surfaces of tobacco leaves inoculated with the mutant strains revealed only small amounts of extracellular polymeric matrix around these mutants, indicating disruption of the mature biofilm. tolerance to antibiotics was drastically increased for the delta pvdl mutant, as for the delta psyi mutant, which is defective in ahl production. these results demonstrated that pyoverdine synthesis and the quorum-sensing system of pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 6605 are indispensable for virulence in host tobacco infection and that ahl may negatively regulate tolerance to antibiotics.

TI  == a survey of tonb-dependent receptors in fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  == for bacteria with an aerobic lifestyle, iron is in the oxidized fe(3+) form, hence poorly soluble. the solution is the synthesis and excretion of siderophores with a high affinity for iron. these ferrisiderophores are recognized by tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors in gram-negative bacteria. haem is also a source of iron and is captured via tonb-dependent receptors as well. in many cases bacterial genomes encode genes for receptors for siderophores produced by other microorganisms (xenosiderophores). pseudomonads are known for their high adaptive capacity and it is therefore not surprising to find a relatively large number of genes encoding these receptors. in this study we analysed the genomes of three fluorescent pseudomonads available in the pseudomonas genome database (http://www.pseudomonas.com; p. aeruginosa, p. putida, p. syringae) in order to extract the genes coding for tonb-dependent receptors. as expected we observed differences between species for the number of receptors. we also report differences within species, suggesting the acquisition of some genes via horizontal gene transfer, including those coding for the ferripyoverdine receptors. we also report cases where duplications of receptor genes are observed and the presence of 'receptor islands'. our study strongly supports the notion of 'core' and 'accessory' tonb-dependent receptors within each species, with the ferripyoverdine receptors belonging to the last category.

AB  == aims: to design and evaluate a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) protocol by combining comparative genomics and bioinformatics for characterization of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (psp), the causal agent of halo blight disease of bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.). methods and results: genomic sequences of pseudomonas syringae pathovars, p. fluorescens and p. aeruginosa were analysed using multiple sequence alignment. a pathovar-specific region encoding pathogenicity-related secondary metabolites in the psp genome was targeted for developing a lamp assay. the final assay targeted a polyketide synthase gene, and readily differentiated psp strains from other pseudomonas syringae pathovars and other pseudomonas species, as well as other plant pathogenic bacteria, e.g. species of pectobacterium, erwinia and pantoea. conclusion: a lamp assay has been developed for rapid and specific characterization and identification of psp from other pathovars of p. syringae and other plant-associated bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this paper describes an approach combining a bioinformatic data mining strategy and comparative genomics with the lamp technology for characterization and identification of a plant pathogenic bacterium. the lamp assay could serve as a rapid protocol for microbial identification and detection with significant applications in agriculture and environmental sciences.

TI  == human- and plant-pathogenic pseudomonas species produce bacteriocins exhibiting colicin m-like hydrolase activity towards peptidoglycan precursors.
AB  == genes encoding proteins that exhibit similarity to the c-terminal domain of escherichia coli colicin m were identified in the genomes of some pseudomonas species, namely, p. aeruginosa, p. syringae, and p. fluorescens. these genes were detected only in a restricted number of strains. in p. aeruginosa, for instance,  the colicin m homologue gene was located within the exou-containing genomic island a, a large horizontally acquired genetic element and virulence determinant. here we report the cloning of these genes from the three pseudomonas species and the purification and biochemical characterization of the different colicin m homologues. all of them were shown to exhibit mg(2+)-dependent diphosphoric diester hydrolase activity toward the two undecaprenyl phosphate-linked peptidoglycan precursors (lipids i and ii) in vitro. in all cases, the site of cleavage was localized between the undecaprenyl and pyrophospho-murnac moieties of these precursors. these enzymes were not active on the cytoplasmic precursor udp-murnac-pentapeptide or (or only very poorly) on undecaprenyl pyrophosphate. these colicin m homologues have a narrow range of antibacterial activity. the p. aeruginosa protein at low concentrations was shown to inhibit growth of sensitive p. aeruginosa strains. these proteins thus represent a new class of bacteriocins (pyocins), the first ones reported thus far in the genus pseudomonas that target peptidoglycan metabolism.

TI  == no role for bacterially produced salicylic acid in rhizobacterial induction of systemic resistance in arabidopsis.
AB  == abstract the role of bacterially produced salicylic acid (sa) in the induction of systemic resistance in plants by rhizobacteria is far from clear. the strong sa producer pseudomonas fluorescens wcs374r induces resistance in radish but not in  arabidopsis thaliana, whereas application of sa leads to induction of resistance  in both plant species. in this study, we compared p. fluorescens wcs374r with three other sa-producing fluorescent pseudomonas strains, p. fluorescens wcs417r  and cha0r, and p. aeruginosa 7nsk2 for their abilities to produce sa under different growth conditions and to induce systemic resistance in a. thaliana against bacterial speck, caused by p. syringae pv. tomato. all strains produced sa in vitro, varying from 5 fg cell(-1) for wcs417r to >25 fg cell(-1) for wcs374r. addition of 200 mum fecl(3) to standard succinate medium abolished sa production in all strains. whereas the incubation temperature did not affect sa production by wcs417r and 7nsk2, strains wcs374r and cha0r produced more sa when  grown at 33 instead of 28 degrees c. wcs417r, cha0r, and 7nsk2 induced systemic resistance apparently associated with their ability to produce sa, but wcs374r did not. conversely, a mutant of 7nsk2 unable to produce sa still triggered induced systemic resistance (isr). the possible involvement of sa in the induction of resistance was evaluated using sa-nonaccumulating transgenic nahg plants. strains wcs417r, cha0r, and 7nsk2 induced resistance in nahg arabidopsis. also, wcs374r, when grown at 33 or 36 degrees c, triggered isr in these plants, but not in ethylene-insensitive ein2 or in non-plant pathogenesis- related protein-expressing npr1 mutant plants, irrespective of the growth temperature of  the bacteria. these results demonstrate that, whereas wcs374r can be manipulated  to trigger isr in arabidopsis, sa is not the primary determinant for the induction of systemic resistance against bacterial speck disease by this bacterium. also, for the other saproducing strains used in this study, bacterial  determinants other than sa must be responsible for inducing resistance.

AB  == bacteria that survive under variable conditions possess an assortment of genetic  regulators to meet these challenges. the group iv or extracytoplasmic function (ecf) sigma factors regulate gene expression in response to specific environmental signals by altering the promoter specificity of rna polymerase. we  have undertaken a study of pvds, a group iv sigma factor encoded by pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 (dc3000), a plant pathogen that is likely to encounter variations in nutrient availability as well as plant host defences. the gene encoding pvds was previously identified by sequence similarity to the pseudomonas aeruginosa orthologue, which directs transcription of genes encoding the biosynthesis of pyoverdine, a siderophore involved in iron acquisition, and is responsible for the characteristic fluorescence of the pseudomonads. we identified 15 promoters regulated by pvds in dc3000 and characterized the promoter motif using computational analysis. mutagenesis of conserved nucleotides within the motif interfered with promoter function and the degree of the effect was different depending on which region of the motif was mutated. hidden markov models constructed from alignments of sequence motifs extracted from dc3000 and pao1 were used to query genomes of dc3000 and other fluorescent pseudomonads for  similar motifs. we conclude that the role of pvds as a regulator of pyoverdine synthesis is conserved among the fluorescent pseudomonads, but the promoters recognized by pvds orthologues may differ subtly from species to species.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae bett is a low-affinity choline transporter that is responsible for superior osmoprotection by choline over glycine betaine.
AB  == the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae derives better osmoprotection from choline than from glycine betaine, unlike most bacteria that have been characterized. in this report, we identified a betaine/carnitine/choline family transporter (bcct) in p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000 that mediates the transport of choline and acetylcholine. this transporter has a particularly low affinity (k(m) of 876 microm) and high capacity (v(max) of 80 nmol/min/mg of protein) for choline transport relative to other known bccts. although bett activity increased in response to hyperosmolarity, bett mediated significant uptake under low-osmolarity conditions, suggesting a role in transport for both osmoprotection and catabolism. growth studies with mutants deficient in bett and  other choline transporters demonstrated that bett was responsible for the superior osmoprotection conferred to p. syringae by choline over glycine betaine  when these compounds were provided at high concentrations (>100 microm). these results suggest that p. syringae has evolved to survive in relatively choline-rich habitats, a prediction that is supported by the common association of p. syringae with plants and the widespread production of choline, but genus- and species-specific production of glycine betaine, by plants. among the three putative bcct family transporters in pseudomonas aeruginosa and six in pseudomonas putida, different transporters were predicted to function based on similarity to escherichia coli bett than to p. syringae bett. functional p. putida and p. aeruginosa transporters were identified, and their possession of a  long c-terminal tail suggested an osmoregulatory function for this tail; this function was confirmed for p. syringae bett using deletion derivatives.

TI  == linear osmoregulated periplasmic glucans are encoded by the opggh locus of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (opgs) are produced by many proteobacteria and  are important for bacterial-host interactions. the opgg and opgh genes involved in the synthesis of opgs are the most widely distributed genes in proteobacterial genomes. two other non-homologous genes, both named ndvb, are also involved in opg biosynthesis in several species. the pseudomonas aeruginosa genome possesses  two orfs, pa5077 and pa5078, that show similarity to opgh and opgg of pseudomonas syringae, respectively, and one orf, pa1163, similar to ndvb of sinorhizobium meliloti. here, we report that the opggh locus of p. aeruginosa pa14 is involved  in the synthesis of linear polymers with beta-1,2-linked glucosyl residues branched with a few beta-1,6 glucosyl residues. succinyl residues also substitute this glucose backbone. transcription of opggh is repressed by high osmolarity. low osmolarity promotes the formation of highly structured biofilms, but biofilm  development is slower and the area of biomass is reduced under high osmolarity. biofilm development of an opggh mutant grown under low osmolarity presents a similar phenotype to the wild-type biofilm grown under high osmolarity. these results suggest that opgs are important for biofilm formation under conditions of low osmolarity. a previous study suggested that the p. aeruginosa ndvb gene is involved in the resistance of biofilms to antibiotics. we have shown that ndvb is not involved in the biosynthesis of the opg described here, and opggh do not appear to be involved in the resistance of p. aeruginosa pa14 biofilms to antibiotics.

TI  == functional characterization of bacterial oligosaccharyltransferases involved in o-linked protein glycosylation.
AB  == protein glycosylation is an important posttranslational modification that occurs  in all domains of life. pilins, the structural components of type iv pili, are o  glycosylated in neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this work, we characterized the p. aeruginosa 1244  and n. meningitidis mc58 o glycosylation systems in escherichia coli. in both cases, sugars are transferred en bloc by an oligosaccharyltransferase (otase) named pgll in n. meningitidis and pilo in p. aeruginosa. we show that, like pilo, pgll has relaxed glycan specificity. both otases are sufficient for glycosylation, but they require translocation of the undecaprenol-pyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharide substrates into the periplasm for activity. whereas pilo activity is restricted to short oligosaccharides, pgll is able to transfer diverse oligo- and polysaccharides. this functional characterization supports the concept that despite their low sequence similarity, pilo and pgll belong to a new family of "o-otases" that transfer oligosaccharides from lipid carriers to hydroxylated amino acids in proteins. to date, such activity has not been identified for eukaryotes. to our knowledge, this is the first report describing recombinant o glycoproteins synthesized in e. coli.

TI  == alginate production by pseudomonas putida creates a hydrated microenvironment and contributes to biofilm architecture and stress tolerance under water-limiting conditions.
AB  == biofilms exist in a variety of habitats that are routinely or periodically not saturated with water, and residents must integrate cues on water abundance (matric stress) or osmolarity (solute stress) into lifestyle strategies. here we  examine this hypothesis by assessing the extent to which alginate production by pseudomonas putida strain mt-2 and by other fluorescent pseudomonads occurs in response to water limitations and how the presence of alginate in turn influences biofilm development and stress tolerance. total exopolysaccharide (eps) and alginate production increased with increasing matric, but not solute, stress severity, and alginate was a significant component, but not the major component,  of eps. alginate influenced biofilm architecture, resulting in biofilms that were taller, covered less surface area, and had a thicker eps layer at the air interface than those formed by an mt-2 algd mutant under water-limiting conditions, properties that could contribute to less evaporative water loss. we examined this possibility and show that alginate reduces the extent of water loss from biofilm residents by using a biosensor to quantify the water potential of individual cells and by measuring the extent of dehydration-mediated changes in fatty acid composition following a matric or solute stress shock. alginate deficiency decreased survival of desiccation not only by p. putida but also by pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae b728a. our findings suggest that in response to water-limiting conditions, pseudomonads produce alginate, which influences biofilm development and eps physiochemical properties. collectively these responses may facilitate the maintenance of a hydrated microenvironment, protecting residents from desiccation stress and increasing survival.

AB  == the ability to form biofilms is seen as an increasingly important colonization strategy among both pathogenic and environmental bacteria. a survey of 185 plant-associated, phytopathogenic, soil and river pseudomonas isolates resulted in 76% producing biofilms at the air-liquid (a-l) interface after selection in static microcosms. considerable variation in biofilm phenotype was observed, including waxy aggregations, viscous and floccular masses, and physically cohesive biofilms with continuously varying strengths over 1500-fold. calcofluor  epifluorescent microscopy identified cellulose as the matrix component in biofilms produced by pseudomonas asplenii, pseudomonas corrugata, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas marginalis, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas savastanoi and pseudomonas syringae isolates. cellulose expression and biofilm formation could be induced by the constitutively active wspr19 mutant of the cyclic-di-gmp-associated, ggdef domain-containing response regulator involved in  the p. fluorescens sbw25 wrinkly spreader phenotype and cellular aggregation in pseudomonas aeruginosa pa01. wspr19 could also induce p. putida kt2440, which otherwise did not produce a biofilm or express cellulose, as well as escherichia  coli k12 and salmonella typhimurium lt2, both of which express cellulose yet lack wspr homologues. statistical analysis of biofilm parameters suggest that biofilm  development is a more complex process than that simply described by the production of attachment and matrix components and bacterial growth. this complexity was also seen in multivariate analysis as a species-ecological habitat effect, underscoring the fact that in vitro biofilms are abstractions of those surface and volume colonization processes used by bacteria in their natural environments.

TI  == the algt gene of pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea and new insights into the transcriptional organization of the algt-muc gene cluster.
AB  == the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea infects soybean plants and causes bacterial blight. in addition to p. syringae, the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa and the soil bacterium azotobacter vinelandii produce the exopolysaccharide alginate, a copolymer of d-mannuronic and l-guluronic acids. alginate production in p. syringae has been associated with increased fitness and virulence in planta. alginate biosynthesis is tightly controlled by proteins encoded by the algt-muc regulatory gene cluster in p. aeruginosa and a. vinelandii. these genes encode the alternative sigma factor algt (sigma(22)), its anti-sigma factors muca and mucb, mucc, a protein with a controversial function that is absent in p. syringae, and mucd, a periplasmic serine protease and homolog of htra in escherichia coli. we compared an alginate-deficient algt mutant of p. syringae pv. glycinea with an alginate-producing derivative in which algt is intact. the alginate-producing derivative grew significantly slower in vitro growth but showed increased epiphytic fitness and better symptom development in planta. evaluation of expression levels for algt, muca, mucb, mucd, and algd, which encodes an alginate biosynthesis gene, showed that mucd transcription is not dependent on algt in p.  syringae in vitro. promoter mapping using primer extension experiments confirmed  this finding. results of reverse transcription-pcr demonstrated that algt, muca,  and mucb are cotranscribed as an operon in p. syringae. northern blot analysis revealed that mucd was expressed as a 1.75-kb monocistronic mrna in p. syringae.

TI  == bacterial repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences are dna targets for insertion sequence elements.
AB  == background: mobile elements are involved in genomic rearrangements and virulence  acquisition, and hence, are important elements in bacterial genome evolution. the insertion of some specific insertion sequences had been associated with repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep) elements. considering that there are a sufficient number of available genomes with described reps, and exploiting the advantage of the traceability of transposition events in genomes, we decided to exhaustively analyze the relationship between rep sequences and mobile elements.  results: this global multigenome study highlights the importance of repetitive extragenic palindromic elements as target sequences for transposases. the study is based on the analysis of the dna regions surrounding the 981 instances of insertion sequence elements with respect to the positioning of rep sequences in the 19 available annotated microbial genomes corresponding to species of bacteria with reported rep sequences. this analysis has allowed the detection of the specific insertion into rep sequences for ispsy8 in pseudomonas syringae dc3000,  ispa11 in p. aeruginosa pa01, isppu9 and isppu10 in p. putida kt2440, and isrm22  and isrm19 in sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 genome. preference for insertion in extragenic spaces with rep sequences has also been detected for ispsy7 in p. syringae dc3000, isrm5 in s. meliloti and isnm1106 in neisseria meningitidis mc58 and z2491 genomes. probably, the association with rep elements that we have detected analyzing genomes is only the tip of the iceberg, and this association could be even more frequent in natural isolates. conclusion: our findings characterize rep elements as hot spots for transposition and reinforce the relationship between rep sequences and genomic plasticity mediated by mobile elements. in addition, this study defines a subset of rep-recognizer transposases with high target selectivity that can be useful in the development of new tools for genome manipulation.

TI  == characterization of a nonspecific phosphopantetheinyl transferase from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae ff5.
AB  == the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferases (pptases) catalyze the transfer of a 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety from coenzyme a to phosphopantetheine-dependent carrier proteins. the carrier proteins (cps) are required for the biosynthesis of peptides synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthases and the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. a single pptase (pcps) is present in the pathogenic  bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa. several pathovars of pseudomonas syringae produce the chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin coronatine. structural genes for coronatine biosynthesis include two acps, two acp domains, and one peptidyl carrier protein (pcp) domain. to gain insight into factors affecting coronatine biosynthesis, the pptase of p. syringae pv. syringae ff5 has been investigated. a single pptase gene (pspt) was amplified from this organism by pcr. the translation product pspt exhibited 62% identity to pcps as well as higher levels  of identity to other, uncharacterized pseudomonad pptases. pspt was overproduced  in soluble form in escherichia coli and its enzymatic properties were compared with those of pcps. pspt exhibited broad substrate specificity, and it displayed  the highest activity with a pcp domain. in contrast, the most efficient substrates for pcps are cps from primary metabolism. these results indicate phosphopantetheinyl transferases from different pseudomonas sp. may vary significantly in their enzymatic properties.

TI  == comparison of the complete genome sequences of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae  b728a and pv. tomato dc3000.
AB  == the complete genomic sequence of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae b728a (pss b728a) has been determined and is compared with that of p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 (pst dc3000). the two pathovars of this economically important species of  plant pathogenic bacteria differ in host range and other interactions with plants, with pss having a more pronounced epiphytic stage of growth and higher abiotic stress tolerance and pst dc3000 having a more pronounced apoplastic growth habitat. the pss b728a genome (6.1 mb) contains a circular chromosome and  no plasmid, whereas the pst dc3000 genome is 6.5 mbp in size, composed of a circular chromosome and two plasmids. although a high degree of similarity exists between the two sequenced pseudomonads, 976 protein-encoding genes are unique to  pss b728a when compared with pst dc3000, including large genomic islands likely to contribute to virulence and host specificity. over 375 repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences unique to pss b728a when compared with pst dc3000 are widely distributed throughout the chromosome except in 14 genomic islands, which  generally had lower gc content than the genome as a whole. content of the genomic islands varies, with one containing a prophage and another the plasmid pklc102 of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1. among the 976 genes of pss b728a with no counterpart in pst dc3000 are those encoding for syringopeptin, syringomycin, indole acetic acid biosynthesis, arginine degradation, and production of ice nuclei. the genomic comparison suggests that several unique genes for pss b728a such as ectoine synthase, dna repair, and antibiotic production may contribute to the epiphytic fitness and stress tolerance of this organism.

TI  == lineage-specific regions in pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc3000.
AB  == summary comparative analyses of the chromosome of pseudomonas syringae pv tomato  dc3000 with the finished, complete genomes of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, an animal pathogen, and the non-pathogenic soil inhabitant pseudomonas putida kt2440 revealed a high degree of sequence conservation in genes involved in 'housekeeping functions'. however, divergence is present among these three fluorescent pseudomonads, yielding 'suites' of species-specific genes that may provide the genetic basis for adaptation to an ecological niche and lifestyle. for dc3000, 1053 genes located on the chromosome were specific to dc3000 and not  present in pao1 or kt2440. the majority of these dc3000-specific genes either lack a known function or are mobile genetic elements. however, these genes do share features among themselves such as association with regions of atypical trinucleotides, unusual g+c content and localization within large tracts of dc3000-specific sequence, suggestive of lateral gene transfer events. indeed, a comparison of syntenic blocks among these three complete pseudomonas genomes revealed that a substantial portion (533) of the dc3000-specific chromosomal genes (1053) were located in lineage-specific regions (defined as being larger than 2 kb and enriched in mobile genetic elements and/or genes specific to dc3000 in this three-way comparison). a large proportion of mobile genetic elements (199 of 318 genes; 63%), which are highly enriched in dc3000, were present within such regions. similarly, most of the genes encoding type iii secretion system virulence effectors were located in lineage-specific regions. consistent with the plasticity of the dc3000 genome, a putative chromosomal inversion mediated by identical copies of ispsy6 involving 2838 kb (44%) of the dc3000 genome was detected. these data suggest that a substantial portion of the differentiation of dc3000, a plant pathogen, from an animal pathogen and a soil inhabitant has involved transfer of a large number of novel genes coupled with amplification of  mobile genetic elements.

TI  == structure of the core oligosaccharide of a rough-type lipopolysaccharide of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola.
AB  == the core structure of the lipopolysaccharide (lps) isolated from a rough strain of the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, gspb 711, was investigated by sugar and methylation analyses, fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance esi ms, and one- and two-dimensional 1h-, 13c- and 31p-nmr spectroscopy. strong alkaline deacylation of the lps resulted in two core-lipid a backbone undecasaccharide pentakisphosphates in the ratio approximately 2.5 : 1, which corresponded to outer core glycoforms 1 and 2 terminated with either l-rhamnose or 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (kdo), respectively. mild acid degradation of the lps gave the major glycoform 1 core octasaccharide and a minor truncated glycoform 2 core heptasaccharide, which resulted from the cleavage of the terminal kdo residues. the inner core of p. syringae is distinguished by a high degree of phosphorylation of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose residues with phosphate, diphosphate and ethanolamine diphosphate groups. the glycoform 1 core is structurally similar but not identical to one of the core glycoforms of the human pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa. the outer core composition and structure may be useful as a chemotaxonomic marker for the p. syringae group of bacteria, whereas a more conserved inner core structure appears to be representative for the whole genus pseudomonas.

TI  == innate immunity in arabidopsis thaliana: lipopolysaccharides activate nitric oxide synthase (nos) and induce defense genes.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) are cell-surface components of gram-negative bacteria and are microbe-/pathogen-associated molecular patterns in animal pathosystems. as for plants, the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction in response to lps are not known. here, we show that arabidopsis thaliana reacts to lps with a rapid burst of no, a hallmark of innate immunity in animals. fifteen lps preparations (among them burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and erwinia carotovora) as well as lipoteichoic acid from gram-positive staphylococcus aureus were found  to trigger no production in suspension-cultured arabidopsis cells as well as in leaves. no was detected by confocal laser-scanning microscopy in conjunction with the fluorophore 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate, by electron paramagnetic resonance, and by a no synthase (nos) assay. the source of  no was addressed by using t-dna insertion lines. interestingly, lps did not activate the pathogen-inducible varp nos, but atnos1, a distinct nos previously associated with hormonal signaling in plants. a prominent feature of lps treatment was activation of defense genes, which proved to be mediated by no. northern analyses and transcription profiling by using dna microarrays revealed induction of defense-associated genes both locally and systemically. finally, atnos1 mutants showed dramatic susceptibility to the pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000. in sum, perception of lps and induction of nos contribute toward the activation of plant defense responses.

TI  == algr functions in algc expression and virulence in pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain ff5 is a phytopathogen associated with a rapid dieback on ornamental pear trees. p. syringae and the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa produce the exopolysaccharide alginate, a copolymer of mannuronic and guluronic acid. in p. aeruginosa, the response regulator algr (algr1) is required for transcription of algc and algd, which encode key enzymes  in the alginate biosynthetic pathway. in p. syringae ff5, however, algr is not required for the activation of algd. interestingly, algr mutants of p. syringae remain nonmucoid, indicating an undefined role for this response regulator in alginate biosynthesis. in the current study, the algc promoter region was cloned  from p. syringae pv. syringae strain ff5, and sequence analysis of the algc promoter indicated the presence of potential binding sites for algr and sigma(54), the alternative sigma factor encoded by rpon. the algc promoter from p. syringae ff5 (psalgc) was cloned upstream of a promoterless glucuronidase gene (uida), and the psalgc-uida transcriptional fusion was used to monitor algc expression in strains ff5.32 (algr mutant of p. syringae ff5) and pg4180.k2 (rpon mutant of p. syringae pv. glycinea pg4180). expression of the psalgc-uida fusion  was fourfold lower in both the algr and rpon mutants as compared to respective wild-type strains, indicating that both algr and sigma(54) are required for full  activation of algc transcription in p. syringae pv. syringae. algr from p. syringae was successfully overproduced in escherichia coli as a c-terminal translational fusion to the maltose-binding protein (mbp). gel shift experiments  indicated that mbp-algr binds strongly to the algc promoter region. biological assays demonstrated that the algr mutant was significantly impaired in both pathogenicity and epiphytic fitness as compared to the wild-type strain. these results, along with the gene expression studies, indicate that algr has a positive role in the activation of algc in p. syringae and contributes to both virulence and epiphytic fitness. furthermore, the symptoms observed with wild-type p. syringae ff5 suggest that this strain can move systemically in leaf  tissue, and that a functional copy of algr is required for systemic movement.

TI  == identification of a novel steroid inducible gene associated with the beta hsd locus of comamonas testosteroni.
AB  == comamonas testosteroni is a soil bacterium, which can use a variety of steroids as carbon and energy source. even if it can be estimated that the complete degradation of the steroid nucleus requires more than 20 enzymatic reactions, the complete molecular characterization of the genes encoding these steroid degradative enzymes as well as the genetic organization of them remain to be elucidated. we have previously reported the cloning and nucleotide sequence of two steroid-inducible genes, beta hsd and stdc encoding 3 beta-17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and a hypothetical protein respectively, located in both ends of a 3.2kb hindiii fragment. herein, we report the cloning and characterization of another steroid-inducible gene, called sip48 (steroid inducible protein), located between these two genes. the analysis of sip48 amino  acid sequence predicts a protein of 438 amino acids with a molecular mass of 48.5 kda. this protein bears high homology with conserved hypothetical proteins of unknown function described in pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia fungorum, shewanella oneidensis, pseudomonas fluorescens and thauera aromatica. the predicted protein shows a typical structure of a leader peptide at its n-terminus. a 48.5 kda protein encoded by the recombinant plasmid was detected by sds-page analysis of in vitro [35s]-methionine labeled polypeptides. analysis of gene expression indicates that sip48 is tightly controlled at the transcriptional level by several steroid compounds. in addition, transcriptional analysis of sip48 and beta hsd in a sip48 mutant strain, indicates that both genes are transcribed as a polycistronic mrna. lacz transcriptional fusions integrated into the chromosome of c. testosteroni demonstrate that a steroid-inducible promoter located upstream of sip48 regulates the expression of both genes.

TI  == characterization of the arga gene required for arginine biosynthesis and syringomycin production by pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == two types of necrosis-inducing lipodepsipeptide toxins, called syringomycin and syringopeptin, are major virulence factors of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain b301d. a previous study showed that a locus, called syra, was required for both syringomycin production and plant pathogenicity, and the syra locus was speculated to encode a regulator of toxin production. in this study, sequence analysis of the 8-kb genomic dna fragment that complements the syra phenotype revealed high conservation among a broad spectrum of fluorescent pseudomonads. the putative protein encoded by open reading frame 4 (orf4) (1,299 bp) in the syra locus region exhibited 85% identity to arga, which is involved in arginine biosynthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa. growth of strain w4s2545, the syra mutant, required supplementation of n minimal medium with arginine. similarly, syringomycin production of syra mutant w4s2545 was restored by the addition of arginine to culture media. furthermore, the insertion of tn5 in the genome of the syra mutant w4s2545 was localized between nucleotides 146 and 147 in orf4, and syringomycin production was complemented in trans with the wild-type dna fragment containing intact orf4. these results demonstrate that the syra locus is the arga gene of p. syringae pv. syringae and that arga is directly involved in arginine biosynthesis and therefore indirectly affects syringomycin production because of  arginine deficiency.

TI  == transition from reversible to irreversible attachment during biofilm formation by pseudomonas fluorescens wcs365 requires an abc transporter and a large secreted protein.
AB  == we report the identification of an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter and an  associated large cell-surface protein that are required for biofilm formation by  pseudomonas fluorescens wcs365. the genes coding for these proteins are designated lap for large adhesion protein. the lapa protein, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 900 kda, is found to be loosely associated with the cell surface and present in the culture supernatant. the lapb, lapc and lape  proteins are predicted to be the cytoplasmic membrane-localized atpase, membrane  fusion protein and outer membrane protein component, respectively, of an abc transporter. consistent with this prediction, lape, like other members of this family, is localized to the outer membrane. we propose that the lapebc-encoded abc transporter participates in the secretion of lapa, as strains with mutations  in the lapebc genes do not have detectable lapa associated with the cell surface  or in the supernatant. the lap genes are conserved among environmental pseudomonads such as p. putida kt2440, p. fluorescens pfo1 and p. fluorescens wcs365, but are absent from pathogenic pseudomonads such as p. aeruginosa and p.  syringae. the wild-type strain of p. fluorescens wcs365 and its lap mutant derivatives were assessed for their biofilm forming ability in static and flow systems. the lap mutant strains are impaired in an early step in biofilm formation and are unable to develop the mature biofilm structure seen for the wild-type bacterium. time-lapse microscopy studies determined that the lap mutants are unable to progress from reversible (or transient) attachment to the irreversible attachment stage of biofilm development. the lap mutants were also found to be defective in attachment to quartz sand, an abiotic surface these organisms likely encounter in the environment.

AB  == involvement of the bacterial thiopurine methyltransferase (btpmt) in natural selenium methylation by freshwater was investigated. a freshwater environment that had no known selenium contamination but exhibited reproducible emission of dimethyl selenide (dmse) or dimethyl diselenide (dmdse) when it was supplemented  with an organic form of selenium [(methyl)selenocysteine] or an inorganic form of selenium (sodium selenite) was used. the distribution of the btpmt gene (tpm) in  the microflora was studied. freshwater bacteria growing on 10 micro m sodium selenite and 10 micro m sodium selenate were isolated, and 4.5 and 10% of the strains, respectively, were shown by colony blot hybridization to hybridize with  a pseudomonas syringae tpm dna probe. ribotyping showed that these strains are closely related. the complete rrs sequence of one of the strains, designated hsa.28, was obtained and analyzed. its closest phyletic neighbor was found to be  the pseudomonas anguilliseptica rrs sequence. the hsa.28 strain grown with sodium selenite or (methyl)selenocysteine produced significant amounts of dmse and dmdse. the hsa.28 tpm gene was isolated by genomic dna library screening and sequencing. blastp comparisons of the deduced hsa.28 btpmt sequence with p. syringae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, rat, and human thiopurine methyltransferase sequences revealed that the levels of similarity were 52 to 71%. pcr-generated escherichia coli subclones containing the hsa.28 tpm open reading frame were constructed. e. coli cells harboring the constructs and grown  with sodium selenite or (methyl)selenocysteine produced significant levels of dmse and dmdse, confirming that the gene plays a role in selenium methylation. the effect of strain hsa.28 population levels on freshwater dmse and dmdse emission was investigated. an increase in the size of the hsa.28 population was found to enhance significantly the emission of methyl selenides by freshwater samples supplemented with sodium selenite or (methyl)selenocysteine. these data suggest that btpmt can play a role in natural freshwater selenium methylation processes.

AB  == quorum sensing (qs) allows bacteria to assess their local population density and/or physical confinement via the secretion and detection of small, diffusible  signal molecules. this review describes how phytopathogenic bacteria have incorporated qs mechanisms into complex regulatory cascades that control genes for pathogenicity and colonization of host surfaces. traits regulated by qs include the production of extracellular polysaccharides, degradative enzymes, antibiotics, siderophores, and pigments, as well as hrp protein secretion, ti plasmid transfer, motility, biofilm formation, and epiphytic fitness. since qs regulatory systems are often required for pathogenesis, interference with qs signaling may offer a means of controlling bacterial diseases of plants. several  bacterial pathogens of plants that have been intensively studied and have revealed information of both fundamental and practical importance are reviewed here: agrobacterium tumefaciens, pantoea stewartii, erwinia carotovora, ralstonia solanacearum, pseudomonas syringae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas campestris.

AB  == members of the genus pseudomonas (sensu stricto) are important phytopathogens and agents of human infections, while other strains and species have beneficial bioremediation and biocontrol activities. traditionally, these important species  have been difficult to differentiate phenotypically; thus, rrna lineage analyses  have often been invoked. in this report, a newly developed approach is described  to rapidly detect and distinguish fluorescent pseudomonas isolates: pcr amplification of a pseudomonas-specific 990-bp ribosomal rna gene (rdna) fragment [appl. environ. microbiol. 64 (1998) 2545.] coupled with multiple enzyme restriction fragment length polymorphism (merflp) analysis using a single digestion mixture of alui, hinfi, rsai, and tru9i incubated at 37 degrees c. the  method distinguished 116 published sequences and 47 reference strains of authentic pseudomonas representing 28 nomenspecies. a total of 55% (64/116) of the sequences analyzed by merflp were grouped into distinct phylogenetic clusters including pseudomonas putida, p. syringae, p. aeruginosa, p. stutzeri, and p. fluorescens. the utility of the merflps was confirmed when 100% (33/33) of the above named control reference strains were correctly placed into their phylogenetic clusters. the environmental relevance of the merflp method was confirmed when 67% of 28 forest and agricultural soil-derived presumptive pseudomonas environmental clones and isolates were placed into the five major pseudomonad clusters, one clone fell into the p. agarici cluster, and five clones clustered near related pseudomonads. these data demonstrated that the pcr-merflp  protocol provides an efficient and powerful tool for distinguishing isolates and  rdna gene libraries of environmental pseudomonas species.

TI  == subinhibitory bismuth-thiols reduce virulence of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen in mechanically ventilated patients and produces a wide array of virulence factors. bismuth-thiols (bts) are active in vitro against all bacterial lung pathogens, including p. aeruginosa. the objective of these studies was to examine the biochemical and morphologic effects of sublethal bt concentrations on p. aeruginosa and to evaluate virulence in cell culture. bismuth-dimercaprol, at a fraction of the minimal inhibitory concentration, reduced alginate expression by 67% in p. aeruginosa, whereas subinhibitory bismuth-ethanedithiol (bisedt) reduced alginate by 92% in p. syringae. bisedt effects on lipopolysaccharide content and type iii secreted cytoxins were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. subinhibitory bisedt reduced cell-associated lipopolysaccharide, and inhibited processing of the secreted cytotoxic protein exou. bisedt-induced outer membrane blebbing and aggregation of cytoplasmic material was noted in electron microscopy. virulence of p. aeruginosa was assessed by adherence to epithelial cells and sensitivity to serum killing. bisedt inhibited adherence of  p. aeruginosa to 16hbe14o- cells by 28% and to a collagen matrix by 53%. bisedt-treated bacteria were also 100-fold more sensitive to serum bactericidal activity. in summary, low bt concentrations affect p. aeruginosa in a variety of  ways, the combination of which may help prevent or resolve respiratory tract infection.

TI  == a phylogenomic study of the octase genes in pseudomonas syringae pathovars: the horizontal transfer of the argk-tox cluster and the evolutionary history of octase genes on their genomes.
AB  == phytopathogenic pseudomonas syringae is subdivided into about 50 pathovars due to their conspicuous differentiation with regard to pathogenicity. based on the results of a phylogenetic analysis of four genes (gyrb, rpod, hrpl, and hrps), sawada et al. (1999) showed that the ancestor of p. syringae had diverged into at least three monophyletic groups during its evolution. physical maps of the genomes of representative strains of these three groups were constructed, which revealed that each strain had five rrn operons which existed on one circular genome. the fact that the structure and size of genomes vary greatly depending on the pathovar shows that p. syringae genomes are quite rich in plasticity and that they have undergone large-scale genomic rearrangements. analyses of the codon usage and the gc content at the codon third position, in conjunction with phylogenomic analyses, showed that the gene cluster involved in phaseolotoxin synthesis (argk-tox cluster) expanded its distribution by conducting horizontal transfer onto the genomes of two p. syringae pathovars (pv. actinidiae and pv. phaseolicola) from bacterial species distantly related to p. syringae and that its acquisition was quite recent (i.e., after the ancestor of p. syringae diverged into the respective pathovars). furthermore, the results of a detailed analysis of argk [an anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase (anabolic octase) gene], which is present within the argk-tox cluster, revealed the plausible process of generation of an unusual composition of the octase genes on the genomes of these two phaseolotoxin-producing pathovars: a catabolic octase gene (equivalent to the orthologue of arcb of p. aeruginosa) and an anabolic octase gene (argf), which must have been formed by gene duplication, have first been present on the genome of the ancestor of p. syringae; the catabolic octase gene has been deleted; the ancestor has diverged into the respective pathovars; the foreign-originated argk-tox cluster has horizontally transferred onto the genomes of pv. actinidiae and pv. phaseolicola; and hence two copies of only the anabolic octase genes (argk and argf) came to exist on the genomes of these two pathovars. thus, the horizontal gene transfer and the genomic rearrangement were proven to have played an important role in the pathogenic differentiation and diversification of p. syringae.

TI  == analysis and expression of algl, which encodes alginate lyase in pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae produces alginate, an exopolysaccharide that contributes to  the virulence and epiphytic fitness of this phytopathogenic bacterium. p. syringae also produces the algl-encoded alginate lyase, which cleaves the alginate biopolymer via a beta-elimination reaction. the algl gene from p. syringae maps to a 1134 bp region within the alginate biosynthetic operon, and is similar to algl from halomonas marina, p. aeruginosa, azotobacter chroococcum, and a. vinelandii. algl from p. syringae was over expressed in escherichia coli;  two periplasmic forms of algl were overproduced (40 and 37 kda). both forms were  enzymatically active and recognized by antibodies raised against algl from p. aeruginosa. analysis of the regions flanking algl revealed significant homology to algx and algi, genes previously identified in the biosynthetic operon of other alginate-producing bacteria.

TI  == infection of arabidopsis with a necrotrophic pathogen, botrytis cinerea, elicits  various defense responses but does not induce systemic acquired resistance (sar).
AB  == botrytis cinerea is a non-specific necrotrophic pathogen that attacks more than 200 plant species. in contrast to biotrophs, the necrotrophs obtain their nutrients by first killing the host cells. many studies have shown that infection of plants by necrosis-causing pathogens induces a systemic acquired resistance (sar), which provides protection against successive infections by a range of pathogenic organisms. we analyzed the role of sar in b. cinerea infection of arabidopsis. we show that although b. cinerea induced necrotic lesions and camalexin biosynthesis, it did not induce sar-mediated protection against virulent strains of pseudomonas syringae, or against subsequent b. cinerea infections. induction of sar with avirulent p. syringae or by chemical treatment  with salicylic acid (sa) or benzothiadiazole also failed to inhibit b. cinerea growth, although removal of basal sa accumulation by expression of a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase (nahg) gene or by infiltration of 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid, an inhibitor of phenylpropanoid pathway, increased b. cinerea disease symptoms. in addition, we show that b. cinerea induced expression of genes associated with sar, general stress and ethylene/jasmonate-mediated defense pathways. thus, b. cinerea does not induce sar nor is it affected by sar, making it a rare example of a necrogenic pathogen  that does not cause sar.

TI  == the sigma factor algu (algt) controls exopolysaccharide production and tolerance  towards desiccation and osmotic stress in the biocontrol agent pseudomonas fluorescens cha0.
AB  == a variety of stress situations may affect the activity and survival of plant-beneficial pseudomonads added to soil to control root diseases. this study  focused on the roles of the sigma factor algu (synonyms, algt, rpoe, and sigma(22)) and the anti-sigma factor muca in stress adaptation of the biocontrol  agent pseudomonas fluorescens cha0. the algu-muca-mucb gene cluster of strain cha0 was similar to that of the pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas  syringae. strain cha0 is naturally nonmucoid, whereas a muca deletion mutant or algu-overexpressing strains were highly mucoid due to exopolysaccharide overproduction. mucoidy strictly depended on the global regulator gaca. an algu deletion mutant was significantly more sensitive to osmotic stress than the wild-type cha0 strain and the muca mutant were. expression of an algu'-'lacz reporter fusion was induced severalfold in the wild type and in the muca mutant upon exposure to osmotic stress, whereas a lower, noninducible level of expression was observed in the algu mutant. overexpression of algu did not enhance tolerance towards osmotic stress. algu was found to be essential for tolerance of p. fluorescens towards desiccation stress in a sterile vermiculite-sand mixture and in a natural sandy loam soil. the size of the population of the algu mutant declined much more rapidly than the size of the wild-type population at soil water contents below 5%. in contrast to its role in  pathogenic pseudomonads, algu did not contribute to tolerance of p. fluorescens towards oxidative and heat stress. in conclusion, algu is a crucial determinant in the adaptation of p. fluorescens to dry conditions and hyperosmolarity, two major stress factors that limit bacterial survival in the environment.

TI  == construction and analysis of photolyase mutants of pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas syringae: contribution of photoreactivation, nucleotide excision repair, and mutagenic dna repair to cell survival and mutability following exposure to uv-b radiation.
AB  == based on nucleotide sequence homology with the escherichia coli photolyase gene (phr), the phr sequence of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 was identified from the genome sequence, amplified by pcr, cloned, and shown to complement a known phr mutation following expression in escherichia coli sy2. stable, insertional phr mutants containing a tetracycline resistance gene cassette were constructed in p. aeruginosa pao1 and p. syringae pv. syringae ff5 by homologous recombination and  sucrose-mediated counterselection. these mutants showed a decrease in survival compared to the wild type of as much as 19-fold after irradiation at uv-b doses of 1,000 to 1,550 j m(-2) followed by a recovery period under photoreactivating conditions. a phr uvra mutant of p. aeruginosa pao1 was markedly sensitive to uv-b irradiation exhibiting a decrease in survival of 6 orders of magnitude following a uv-b dose of 250 j m(-2). complementation of the phr mutations in p.  aeruginosa pao1 and p. syringae pv. syringae ff5 using the cloned phr gene from strain pao1 resulted in a restoration of survival following uv-b irradiation and  recovery under photoreactivating conditions. the uv-b survival of the phr mutants could also be complemented by the p. syringae mutagenic dna repair determinant rulab. assays for increases in the frequency of spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutants in uv-b-irradiated strains containing rulab indicated that significant uv-b mutability (up to a 51-fold increase compared to a nonirradiated control strain) occurred even in the wild-type pao1 background in which rulab only enhanced the uv-b survival by 2-fold under photoreactivating conditions. the frequency of occurrence of spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutants in the pao1 uvra and uvra phr backgrounds complemented with rulab were 3.8 x 10(-5) and  2.1 x 10(-3), respectively, following a uv-b dose of 1,550 j m(-2). the construction and characterization of phr mutants in the present study will facilitate the determination of the roles of light and dark repair systems in organisms exposed to solar radiation in their natural habitats.

TI  == cadmium-regulated gene fusions in pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  == to study the mechanisms soil bacteria use to cope with elevated concentrations of heavy metals in the environment, a mutagenesis with the lacz-based reporter gene  transposon tn5b20 was performed. random gene fusions in the genome of the common  soil bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens strain atcc 13525 were used to create a bank of 5,000 p. fluorescens mutants. this mutant bank was screened for differential gene expression in the presence of the toxic metal cadmium. fourteen mutants were identified that responded with increased or reduced gene expression  to the presence of cadmium. the mutants were characterized with respect to their  metal-dependent gene expression and their metal tolerance. half the identified mutants reacted with differential gene expression specifically to the metal cadmium, whereas some of the other mutants also responded to elevated concentrations of copper and zinc ions. one of the mutants, strain c8, also showed increased gene expression in the presence of the solvent ethanol, but otherwise no overlap between cadmium-induced gene expression and general stress response was detected. molecular analysis of the corresponding genetic loci was performed using arbitrary polymerase chain reaction (pcr), dna sequencing and comparison of the deduced protein products with sequences deposited in genetic databases. some of the genetic loci targeted by the transposon did not show any similarities to any known genes; thus, they may represent 'novel' loci. the hypothesis that genes that are differentially expressed in the presence of heavy  metals play a role in metal tolerance was verified for one of the mutants. this mutant, strain c11, was hypersensitive to cadmium and zinc ions. in mutant c11, the transposon had inserted into a genetic region displaying similarity to genes  encoding the sensor/regulator protein pairs of two-component systems that regulate gene expression in metal-resistant bacteria, including czcrs of ralstonia eutropha, czrrs of pseudomonas aeruginosa and coprs of pseudomonas syringae. although the p. fluorescens strain used in this study had not been isolated from a metal-rich environment, it nevertheless contained at least one genetic region enabling it to cope with elevated concentrations of heavy metals.

TI  == regulation of the rulab mutagenic dna repair operon of pseudomonas syringae by uv-b (290 to 320 nanometers) radiation and analysis of rulab-mediated mutability  in vitro and in planta.
AB  == the effects of the rulab operon of pseudomonas syringae on mutagenic dna repair and the transcriptional regulation of rulab following irradiation with uv-b wavelengths were determined. for a rulb::km insertional mutant constructed in p.  syringae pv. syringae b86-17, sensitivity to uv-b irradiation increased and uv mutability decreased by 12- to 14-fold. rulab-induced uv mutability was also tracked in phyllosphere populations of b86-17 for up to 5 days following plant inoculation. uv mutability to rifampin resistance (rif(r)) was detected at all sampling points at levels which were significantly greater than in nonirradiated  controls. in p. aeruginosa pao1, the cloned rulab determinant on pjjk17 conferred a 30-fold increase in survival and a 200-fold increase in mutability following a  uv-b dose of 1,900 j m(-2). in comparative studies using defined genetic constructs, we determined that rulab restored mutability to the escherichia coli  umudc deletion mutant rw120 at a level between those of its homologs mucab and umudc. analyses using a rulab::inaz transcriptional fusion in pseudomonas fluorescens pf5 showed that rulab was rapidly induced after uv-b irradiation, with expression levels peaking at 4 h. at the highest uv-b dose administered, transcriptional activity of the rulab promoter was elevated as much as 261-fold compared to that of a nonirradiated control. the importance of rulab for survival of p. syringae in its phyllosphere habitat, coupled with its wide distribution among a broad range of p. syringae genotypes, suggests that this determinant would be appropriate for continued investigations into the ecological ramifications of mutagenic dna repair.

TI  == assembly and function of type iii secretory systems.
AB  == type iii secretion systems allow yersinia spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp., bordetella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enteropathogenic escherichia coli adhering at the surface of a eukaryotic cell to inject bacterial proteins across  the two bacterial membranes and the eukaryotic cell membrane to destroy or subvert the target cell. these systems consist of a secretion apparatus, made of  approximately 25 proteins, and an array of proteins released by this apparatus. some of these released proteins are "effectors," which are delivered into the cytosol of the target cell, whereas the others are "translocators," which help the effectors to cross the membrane of the eukaryotic cell. most of the effectors act on the cytoskeleton or on intracellular-signaling cascades. a protein injected by the enteropathogenic e. coli serves as a membrane receptor for the docking of the bacterium itself at the surface of the cell. type iii secretion systems also occur in plant pathogens where they are involved both in causing disease in susceptible hosts and in eliciting the so-called hypersensitive response in resistant or nonhost plants. they consist of 15-20 hrp proteins building a secretion apparatus and two groups of effectors: harpins and avirulence proteins. harpins are presumably secreted in the extracellular compartment, whereas avirulence proteins are thought to be targeted into plant cells. although a coherent picture is clearly emerging, basic questions remain to be answered. in particular, little is known about how the type iii apparatus fits together to deliver proteins in animal cells. it is even more mysterious for plant cells where a thick wall has to be crossed. in spite of these haunting questions, type iii secretion appears as a fascinating trans-kingdom communication device.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae hrp type iii secretion system and effector proteins.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae is a member of an important group of gram-negative bacterial pathogens of plants and animals that depend on a type iii secretion system to inject virulence effector proteins into host cells. in p. syringae, hrp/hrc genes encode the hrp (type iii secretion) system, and avirulence (avr) and hrp-dependent outer protein (hop) genes encode effector proteins. the hrp/hrc genes of p. syringae pv syringae 61, p. syringae pv syringae b728a, and p. syringae pv tomato dc3000 are flanked by an exchangeable effector locus and a conserved effector locus in a tripartite mosaic hrp pathogenicity island (pai) that is linked to a trna(leu) gene found also in pseudomonas aeruginosa but without linkage to hrp system genes. cosmid phir11 carries a portion of the strain 61 hrp pathogenicity island that is sufficient to direct escherichia coli  and pseudomonas fluorescens to inject hoppsya into tobacco cells, thereby eliciting a hypersensitive response normally triggered only by plant pathogens. large deletions in strain dc3000 revealed that the conserved effector locus is essential for pathogenicity but the exchangeable effector locus has only a minor  role in growth in tomato. p. syringae secretes hoppsya and avrpto in culture in a hrp-dependent manner at ph and temperature conditions associated with pathogenesis. avrpto is also secreted by yersinia enterocolitica. the secretion of avrpto depends on the first 15 codons, which are also sufficient to direct the secretion of an npt reporter from y. enterocolitica, indicating that a universal  targeting signal is recognized by the type iii secretion systems of both plant and animal pathogens.

TI  == the pseudomonas syringae hrp pathogenicity island has a tripartite mosaic structure composed of a cluster of type iii secretion genes bounded by exchangeable effector and conserved effector loci that contribute to parasitic fitness and pathogenicity in plants.
AB  == the plant pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae is divided into pathovars differing in host specificity, with p. syringae pv. syringae (psy) and p. syringae pv. tomato (pto) representing particularly divergent pathovars. p. syringae hrp/hrc genes encode a type iii protein secretion system that appears to translocate avr and hop effector proteins into plant cells. dna sequence analysis of the hrp/hrc regions in psy 61, psy b728a, and pto dc3000 has revealed a hrp pathogenicity island (pai) with a tripartite mosaic structure. the hrp/hrc gene cluster is conserved in all three strains and is flanked by a unique exchangeable effector locus (eel) and a conserved effector locus (cel). the eels begin 3 nt downstream of the stop codon of hrpk and end, after 2.5-7.3 kb of dissimilar intervening dna with trna(leu)-quea-tgt sequences that are also found in pseudomonas aeruginosa but without linkage to any hrp pai sequences. the eels encode diverse putative effectors, including hoppsya (hrma) in psy 61 and proteins similar to avrpphe and the avrb/avrc/avrpphc and avrbst/avrrxv/yopj protein families in psy b728a. the eels also contain mobile genetic element sequences and have a g + c content significantly lower than the rest of the hrp pai or the p. syringae genome. the cel carries at least seven orfs that are conserved between psy b728a and pto dc3000. deletion of the pto dc3000 eel slightly reduces bacterial growth in tomato, whereas deletion of a large portion  of the cel strongly reduces growth and abolishes pathogenicity in tomato.

AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa and the phytopathogen p. syringae produce the exopolysaccharide alginate, which is a copolymer of d-mannuronic and l-guluronic  acids. one of the key regulatory genes controlling alginate biosynthesis in p. aeruginosa is algt, which encodes the alternate sigma factor, sigma(22). in the present study, the algt gene product from p. syringae pv. syringae showed 90% amino acid identity with its p. aeruginosa counterpart, and sequence analysis of  the region flanking algt in p. syringae revealed the presence of nadb, muca, and  mucb in an arrangement virtually identical to that of p. aeruginosa. an algt mutant of p. syringae was defective in alginate production but could be complemented with wild-type algt from p. syringae or p. aeruginosa when expressed in trans. the algt mutant also displayed increased sensitivity to heat, paraquat, and hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)); the latter two compounds are known to generate  reactive oxygen intermediates. signals for activation of algt gene expression in  p. syringae were investigated with an algt::uida transcriptional fusion. like that in p. aeruginosa, algt transcription in p. syringae was activated by heat shock. however, algt expression in p. syringae was also stimulated by osmotic stress and by exposure to paraquat, h(2)o(2), and copper sulfate. the latter two  compounds are frequently encountered during colonization of plant tissue and may  be unique signals for algt activation in p. syringae.

AB  == the 154-kb plasmid was cured from race 7 strain 1449b of the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (pph). cured strains lost virulence toward  bean, causing the hypersensitive reaction in previously susceptible cultivars. restoration of virulence was achieved by complementation with cosmid clones spanning a 30-kb region of the plasmid that contained previously identified avirulence (avr) genes avrd, avrpphc, and avrpphf. single transposon insertions at multiple sites (including one located in avrpphf) abolished restoration of virulence by genomic clones. sequencing 11 kb of the complementing region identified three potential virulence (vir) genes that were predicted to encode hydrophilic proteins and shared the hrp-box promoter motif indicating regulation  by hrpl. one gene achieved partial restoration of virulence when cloned on its own and therefore was designated virppha as the first (a) gene from pph to be identified for virulence function. in soybean, virppha acted as an avr gene controlling expression of a rapid cultivar-specific hypersensitive reaction. sequencing also revealed the presence of homologs of the insertion sequence is100 from yersinia and transposase tn501 from p. aeruginosa. the proximity of several  avr and vir genes together with mobile elements, as well as g+c content significantly lower than that expected for p. syringae, indicates that we have located a plasmid-borne pathogenicity island equivalent to those found in mammalian pathogens.

TI  == involvement of the exopolysaccharide alginate in the virulence and epiphytic fitness of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == alginate, a co-polymer of o-acetylated beta-1,4-linked d-mannuronic acid and l-guluronic acid, has been reported to function in the virulence of pseudomonas syringae, although genetic studies to test this hypothesis have not been undertaken previously. in the present study, we used a genetic approach to evaluate the role of alginate in the pathogenicity of p. syringae pv. syringae 3525, which causes bacterial brown spot on beans. alginate biosynthesis in strain 3525 was disrupted by recombining tn5 into algl, which encodes alginate lyase, resulting in 3525.l. alginate production in 3525.l was restored by the introduction of psk2 or pad4033, which contain the alginate biosynthetic gene cluster from p. syringae pv. syringae ff5 or the alga gene from p. aeruginosa respectively. the role of alginate in the epiphytic fitness of strain 3525 was assessed by monitoring the populations of 3525 and 3525.l on tomato, which is not a host for this pathogen. the mutant 3525.l was significantly impaired in its ability to colonize tomato leaves compared with 3525, indicating that alginate functions in the survival of strain 3525 on leaf surfaces. the contribution of alginate to the virulence of strain 3525 was evaluated by comparing the population dynamics and symptom development of 3525 and 3525.l in bean leaves. although 3525. l retained the ability to form lesions on bean leaves, symptoms were less severe, and the population was significantly reduced in comparison with 3525. these results indicate that alginate contributes to the virulence of p. syringae pv. syringae 3525, perhaps by facilitating colonization or dissemination of the bacterium in planta.

AB  == the gene encoding oprf, a major outer membrane protein in pseudomonas species (formerly known as type 1 pseudomonads), was thought to be constitutively transcribed from a single sigma 70 promoter immediately upstream of the gene. we  now report the identification of a novel putative ecf (extracytoplasmic function) sigma factor gene, sigx, located immediately upstream of oprf in both pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and pseudomonas fluorescens oe 28.3 and show that disruption of this gene significantly reduces oprf expression. in p. aeruginosa, northern analysis demonstrated that this reduction was a result of an effect on transcription of monocistronic oprf combined with a polar effect due to termination of a transcript containing sigx and oprf. comparison of sigx-disrupted and wild-type cell transcripts by primer extension indicated that  monocistronic transcription of oprf occurs from two overlapping promoters, one that is sigx-dependent and resembles ecf sigma factor promoters in its minus-35 region and another promoter that is independent of sigx and is analogous to the sigma 70-type promoter previously reported. complementation of the p. aeruginosa  sigx-disrupted mutant with plasmid-encoded oprf did not resolve the phenotypes associated with this mutant, which included a markedly reduced logarithmic-phase  growth rate in rich medium (compared to that in minimal medium), further reduction of the growth rate in a low-osmolarity environment, secretion of an unidentified pigment, and increased sensitivity to the antibiotic imipenem. this  indicates that sigx is involved in the regulation of other genes in p. aeruginosa. disruption of the sigx gene in p. fluorescens also had an effect on the logarithmic-phase growth rate in rich medium. a conserved sigx gene was also  identified in a pseudomonas syringae isolate and six p. aeruginosa clinical isolates. collectively, these data indicate that an ecf sigma factor plays a role in the regulation and expression of oprf and also affects other genes.

TI  == regulation of alginate biosynthesis in pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == both pseudomonas aeruginosa and the phytopathogen p. syringae produce the exopolysaccharide alginate. however, the environmental signals that trigger alginate gene expression in p. syringae are different from those in p. aeruginosa with copper being a major signal in p. syringae. in p. aeruginosa, the alternate  sigma factor encoded by algt (sigma22) and the response regulator algr1 are required for transcription of algd, a gene which encodes a key enzyme in the alginate biosynthetic pathway. in the present study, we cloned and characterized  the gene encoding algr1 from p. syringae. the deduced amino acid sequence of algr1 from p. syringae showed 86% identity to its p. aeruginosa counterpart. sequence analysis of the region flanking algr1 in p. syringae revealed the presence of argh, algz, and hemc in an arrangement virtually identical to that reported in p. aeruginosa. an algr1 mutant, p. syringae ff5.32, was defective in  alginate production but could be complemented when algr1 was expressed in trans.  the algd promoter region in p. syringae (psalgd) was also characterized and shown to diverge significantly from the algd promoter in p. aeruginosa. unlike p. aeruginosa, algr1 was not required for the transcription of algd in p. syringae,  and psalgd lacked the consensus sequence recognized by algr1. however, both the algd and algr1 upstream regions in p. syringae contained the consensus sequence recognized by sigma22, suggesting that algt is required for transcription of both genes.

TI  == characterization of type iv pilus genes in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000.
AB  == many strains of pseudomonas syringae produce retractile pili that act as receptors for lytic bacteriophage phi 6. as these are also characteristics of type iv pili, it was postulated that p. syringae may possess genes for type iv pilus biogenesis. a cosmid clone bank of p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 genomic dna was used to complement a mutant of pseudomonas aeruginosa defective in the pild (xcpa) prepilin peptidase gene by selection for restoration of extracellular protein secretion, a function also known to require pild. a cosmid able to complement this mutant was also able to complement mutations in the pilb and pilc genes, suggesting that, if the organization of these genes is similar to that of  p. aeruginosa, the cosmid may contain the p. syringae pila. this was confirmed by sequencing a region from this plasmid that was shown to hybridize at low stringency to the p. aeruginosa pila gene. the deduced p. syringae pila polypeptide possesses the characteristic properties of the type iv pilins. heterologous expression of the p. syringae pila in p. aeruginosa was also shown,  conferring not only phi 6 phage sensitivity to p. aeruginosa pila mutants but also sensitivity to po4, a lytic bacteriophage specific for the pilus of p. aeruginosa. this suggests that additional components might be present in the mature pilus of p. aeruginosa that are the true receptors for this phage. chromosomal mutations in p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 pila and pild genes were shown to abolish its sensitivity to bacteriophage phi 6. to determine the importance of p. syringae pilus in plant leaf interactions, these mutations were  tested under laboratory and field conditions. although little effect was seen on  pathogenicity, culturable leaf-associated population sizes of the pila mutant were significantly different from those of the wild-type parent. in addition, the expression of the dc3000 pila gene appears to contribute to the uv tolerance of p. syringae and may play a role in survival on the plant leaf surface.

TI  == the extracytoplasmic function sigma factors: role and regulation.
AB  == alternative sigma factors provide a means of regulating gene expression in response to various extracellular changes. one such class of sigma factors appears to control a variety of functions, including expression of heat-shock genes in escherichia coli, biosynthesis of alginates and carotenoids in pseudomonas aeruginosa and myxococcus xanthus, respectively, iron uptake in e. coli and pseudomonas spp., nickel and cobalt efflux in alcaligenes europhus, plant pathogenicity in pseudomonas syringae and synthesis of outer membrane proteins in photobacterium sp. strain ss9. most of these activities deal with extracytoplasmic functions, and such sigmas have been designated as ecf sigma factors. they have also been characterized in mycobacteria as well as gram-positive bacteria such as streptomyces coelicolor and bacillus subtilus and  the archaea sulpholobus acidocaldarius. ecf factors belong to a subfamily of the  sigma 70 class, based on their sequence conservation and function across bacterial species. the promoter consensus sequences recognized by the ecf factors are also highly conserved. in most of the cases, the activity of these factors is modulated by a cognate inner membrane protein that has been shown, both in e. coli and in p. aeruginosa, to act as an anti-sigma activity. this inner membrane  protein is presumed to serve as a sensor and signalling molecule, allowing an adaptive response to specific environmental change. presumably, an on-and-off switch of the anti-sigma activity leads to the release of the sigma factor and thereby to the co-ordinate transcription of the specific regulon it governs.

TI  == type iii protein secretion systems in bacterial pathogens of animals and plants.
AB  == various gram-negative animal and plant pathogens use a novel, sec-independent protein secretion system as a basic virulence mechanism. it is becoming increasingly clear that these so-called type iii secretion systems inject (translocate) proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, where the translocated proteins facilitate bacterial pathogenesis by specifically interfering with host cell signal transduction and other cellular processes. accordingly, some type iii secretion systems are activated by bacterial contact with host cell surfaces. individual type iii secretion systems direct the secretion and translocation of a variety of unrelated proteins, which account for species-specific pathogenesis phenotypes. in contrast to the secreted virulence factors, most of the 15 to 20 membrane-associated proteins which constitute the type iii secretion apparatus are conserved among different pathogens. most of the inner membrane components of the type iii secretion apparatus show additional homologies to flagellar biosynthetic proteins, while a conserved outer membrane factor is similar to secretins from type ii and other secretion pathways. structurally conserved chaperones which specifically bind to individual secreted  proteins play an important role in type iii protein secretion, apparently by preventing premature interactions of the secreted factors with other proteins. the genes encoding type iii secretion systems are clustered, and various pieces of evidence suggest that these systems have been acquired by horizontal genetic transfer during evolution. expression of type iii secretion systems is coordinately regulated in response to host environmental stimuli by networks of transcription factors. this review comprises a comparison of the structure, function, regulation, and impact on host cells of the type iii secretion systems  in the animal pathogens yersinia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and chlamydia spp. and the plant pathogens pseudomonas syringae, erwinia spp., ralstonia solanacearum, xanthomonas campestris, and rhizobium spp.

TI  == characterization of the alginate biosynthetic gene cluster in pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == alginate, a copolymer of d-mannuronic acid and l-guluronic acid, is produced by a variety of pseudomonads, including pseudomonas syringae. alginate biosynthesis has been most extensively studied in p. aeruginosa, and a number of structural and regulatory genes from this species have been cloned and characterized. in the present study, an alginate-defective (alg-) mutant of p. syringae pv. syringae ff5 was shown to contain a tn5 insertion in algl, a gene encoding alginate lyase. a cosmid clone designated psk2 restored alginate production to the algl mutant and was shown to contain homologs of algd, alg8, alg44, algg, algx (alg60), algl, algf, and alga. the order and arrangement of the structural gene cluster were virtually identical to those previously described for p. aeruginosa. complementation analyses, however, indicated that the structural gene clusters in p. aeruginosa and p. syringae were not functionally interchangeable when expressed from their native promoters. a region upstream of the algd gene in p. syringae pv. syringae was shown to activate the transcription of a promoterless glucuronidase (uida) gene and indicated that transcription initiated upstream of  algd as described for p. aeruginosa. transcription of the algd promoter from p. syringae ff5 was significantly higher at 32 degrees c than at 18 or 26 degrees c  and was stimulated when copper sulfate or sodium chloride was added to the medium. alginate gene expression was also stimulated by the addition of the nonionic solute sorbitol, indicating that osmolarity is a signal for algd expression in p. syringae ff5.

TI  == pilp, a pilus biogenesis lipoprotein in neisseria gonorrhoeae, affects expression of pilq as a high-molecular-mass multimer.
AB  == studies of gonococcal pilus biogenesis are fundamental to understanding organelle structure/function relationships and identifying new approaches to controlling disease. this area of research is also relevant to elucidating the basic mechanisms of outer membrane translocation of macromolecules, which requires components highly related to those involved in type iv pilus expression. previous studies have shown that products of several ancillary pil genes are required for  organelle biogenesis but of these only pilq, a member of the gspd protein family, is a component of the outer membrane. dna sequencing of the region upstream of pilq revealed the presence of two open reading frames (orfs) whose deduced polypeptides shared significant identities with proteins required for pilus expression in pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas syringae, the genes for which are arrayed upstream of a gene encoding a pilq homologue. gonococcal mutants bearing transposon insertions in these orfs were non-piliated and failed  to express pilus-associated phenotypes, and the corresponding genes were designated pilo and pilp. the piliation defects in the mutants could not be ascribed to polarity on distal pilq expression as shown by direct measurement of  pilq antigen in those backgrounds and the use of a novel technique to create tandem duplications in the gonococcus (gc) genome. as predicted by the presence of a consensus lipoprotein signal sequence, pilp expressed in both escherichia coli and gc could be labelled with [3h]-palmitic acid. pilp- as well as pilq- mutants shed pilc, a protein which facilitates pilus assembly and is implicated in epithelial cell adherence, in a soluble form. combined with the finding that levels of multimerized piiq were greatly reduced in pilp- mutants, the results suggest that pilp is required for pilq function and that pilq and pilc may interact during the terminal stages of pilus biogenesis. the findings also support the hypothesis that the gc pilq multimer corresponds to a physiologically relevant form of the protein required for pilus biogenesis.

AB  == a xyle-icec transcriptional fusion was created by ligatinga dna fragment harboring the cloned xyle structural gene from the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida mt-2 into the cloned icec gene of pseudomonas syringae cit7. this fusion construct was integrated into the chromosome of pseudomonas syringae cit7 by homologous recombination. both cis-merodiploid strain cit7m17 and marker exchange strain cit7h69 produced the xyle gene product, catechol2,3-dioxygenase. strain cit7m17, in which xyle was influenced by transcription initiated by the amp promoter on pbr322, exhibited xyle activity in stationary phase at levels about 45 times higher than strain cit7h69, permitting detection of 10(7) cit7m17 cells  in the spectrophotometric assay and 10(3) cells in hplc measurements. the stability of xyle in both cit7m17 and cit7h69 was compared with maintenance of xyle in several plasmid-borne constructs in p.aeruginosa, erwinia herbicola, and  escherichia coli. only the xyle-icec fusion in the chromosome of cit7h69 and cit7m17was stable in plate assays over the course of these studies. even though strain cit7h69 stably expressed xyle, the low level of expression precludes its use in direct spectrophotometric or hplc assays as a means for detecting cells in environmental samples. however, expression of xylein cit7h69 is sufficient for identification of colonies harboring this marker gene which is useful in laboratory plate assays, and as a marker gene system for the detection of environmentally-competent strains chromosomally taggedwith xyle for use in autecological studies.

TI  == gene repression by the ferric uptake regulator in pseudomonas aeruginosa: cycle selection of iron-regulated genes.
AB  == the expression of at least 24 distinct genes of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 is under direct control of the "ferric uptake regulator" (fur). novel targets of the fur protein were isolated in a powerful selex (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment)-like cycle selection consisting of in vitro dna-fur interaction, binding to anti-fur antibody, purification on protein g, and pcr amplification. dna fragments obtained after at least three exponential enrichment cycles were cloned and subjected to dna mobility-shift assays and dnase i footprint analyses to verify the specific interaction with the fur protein in vitro. iron-dependent expression of the corresponding genes in vivo was monitored by rnase protection analysis. in total, 20 different dna fragments were identified which represent actual pseudomonas iron-regulated genes (pigs). while  four pigs are identical to already known genes (pfer, pvds, tonb, and fumc, respectively), 16 pigs represent previously unknown genes. homology studies of the putative proteins encoded by the pigs allowed us to speculate about their possible function. two pig products were highly similar to siderophore receptors  from various species, and three pig products were significantly homologous to alternative sigma factors. furthermore, homologs of the escherichia coli orf1-tolq, nuoa, stringent starvation protein ssp, and of a two-component regulatory system similar to the pseudomonas syringae lema sensor kinase were identified. the putative gene products of seven additional pigs did not show significant homologies to any known proteins. the pigs were mapped on the p.aeruginosa chromosome. their possible role in iron metabolism and virulence of  p. aeruginosa is discussed.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the katb gene of pseudomonas aeruginosa encoding  a hydrogen peroxide-inducible catalase: purification of katb, cellular localization, and demonstration that it is essential for optimal resistance to hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an obligate aerobe that is virtually ubiquitous in the  environment. during aerobic respiration, the metabolism of dioxygen can lead to the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, one of which includes hydrogen peroxide. to counteract the potentially toxic effects of this compound, p. aeruginosa possesses two heme-containing catalases which detoxify hydrogen peroxide. in this study, we have cloned katb, encoding one catalase gene of p. aeruginosa. the gene was cloned on a 5.4-kb ecori fragment and is composed of 1,539 bp, encoding 513 amino acids. the amino acid sequence of the p. aeruginosa  katb was approximately 65% identical to that of a catalase from a related species, pseudomonas syringae. the katb gene was mapped to the 71- to 75-min region of the p. aeruginosa chromosome, the identical region which harbors both soda and sodb genes encoding both manganese and iron superoxide dismutases. when  cloned into a catalase-deficient mutant of escherichia coli (um255), the recombinant p. aeruginosa katb was expressed (229 u/mg) and afforded this strain  resistance to hydrogen peroxide nearly equivalent to that of the wild-type e. coli strain (hb101). the katb protein was purified to homogeneity and determined  to be a tetramer of approximately 228 kda, which was in good agreement with the predicted protein size derived from the translated katb gene. interestingly, katb was not produced during the normal p. aeruginosa growth cycle, and catalase activity was greater in nonmucoid than in mucoid, alginate-producing organisms. when exposed to hydrogen peroxide and, to a greater extent, paraquat, total catalase activity was elevated 7- to 16-fold, respectively. in addition, an increase in katb activity caused a marked increase in resistance to hydrogen peroxide. katb was localized to the cytoplasm, while kata, the "housekeeping" enzyme, was detected in both cytoplasmic and periplasmic extracts. a p. aeruginosa katb mutant demonstrated 50% greater sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide  than wild-type bacteria, suggesting that katb is essential for optimal resistance of p. aeroginosa to exogenous hydrogen peroxide.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the dna replication origin region of a bacteroides vulgatus plasmid, pip417, encoding 5-nitroimidazole resistance has been determined. this region of 1934 bp presents some characteristics similar to those of other replication protein-dependent origins. it contains a large open reading  frame which could encode a basic rep protein (repa) of 36.8 kda. upstream of this orf exist an at-rich region, three direct repeats (iterons) of 21 bp, multiple dnaa binding sites, and sites, and sites for the integration host factor (ihf). moreover, the amino acid sequence of the pip417 repa protein shows similarities with those of other rep proteins encoded by plasmids of gram-negative bacteria: pro1600 from pseudomonas aeruginosa; pps10 from pseudomonas syringae; pfa3 from neisseria gonorrhoeae; and two cryptic plasmids from campylobacter hyointestinalis and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. although repa can be expressed in  an escherichia coli in vitro transcription-translation assay, vectors containing  the pip417 replication origin did not replicate in e. coli. the homology of the pip417 replication region with the corresponding regions of other bacteroides spp, plasmids was also studied by southern blot hybridization. the results indicated that the repa gene of plasmid pip417 is homologous to that of plasmid pip421, but not of plasmid pip419. the replication region of plasmid pip421 was sequenced and showed about 80% identity at the nucleotide level with that of pip417. a small (3634-bp) cloning vector (pfk12) of entirely defined nucleotide sequence was constructed for bacteroides spp.

AB  == the syrb and syrc genes are required for synthesis of syringomycin, a lipodepsipeptide phytotoxin produced by pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, and are induced by plant-derived signal molecules. a 4,842-bp chromosomal region containing the syrb and syrc genes of strain b301d was sequenced and characterized. the open reading frame (orf) of syrb was 2,847 bp in length and was predicted to encode an approximately 105-kda protein, syrb, with 949 amino acids. searches of databases revealed that syrb shares homology with members of a superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes involved in peptide antibiotic and siderophore synthesis in a diverse spectrum of microorganisms. syrb exhibited the highest degree of overall similarity (56.4%) and identity (33.8%) with the first  amino acid-activating domain of pyoverdin synthetase, pvdd, of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the n-terminal portion of syrb contained a domain of approximately 600 amino acids that resembles the amino acid-activating domains of thiotemplate-employing peptide synthetases. the syrb domain contained six signature core sequences with the same order and spacing as observed in all known amino acid-activating domains involved in nonribosomal peptide synthesis. core sequence 6 of syrb, for example, was similar to the binding site for 4'-phosphopantetheine, a cofactor required for thioester formation. the syrc orf  (1,299 bp) was located 175 bp downstream of the syrb orf. analysis of the transcriptional and translational relationship between the syrb and syrc genes demonstrated that they are expressed independently. the syrc orf was predicted to encode an approximately 48-kda protein product of 433 amino acids which is 42 to  48% similar to a number of thioesterases, including fatty acid thioesterases, haloperoxidases, and acyltransferases, that contain a characteristic gxs (c) xg motif. in addition, a zinc-binding motif was found near the c terminus of syrc. the data suggest that syrb and syrc function as peptide synthetases in a thiotemplate mechanism of syringomycin biosynthesis.

TI  == copper as a signal for alginate synthesis in pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == plant-associated pseudomonads are commonly exposed to copper bactericides, which  are applied to reduce the disease incidence caused by these bacteria. consequently, many of these bacteria have acquired resistance or tolerance to copper salts. we recently conducted a survey of 37 copper-resistant (cur) pseudomonas spp., including p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, p. syringae, and p. viridiflava, and found that a subset of the p. syringae strains showed a dramatic increase in exopolysaccharide (eps) production on mannitol-glutamate medium containing cuso4 at 250 micrograms/ml. a modified carbazole assay indicated that  the eps produced on copper-amended media contained high levels of uronic acids, suggesting that the eps was primarily alginic acid. uronic acids extracted from selected strains were further confirmed to be alginate by demonstrating their sensitivity to alginate lyase and by descending paper chromatography following acid hydrolysis. subinhibitory levels of arsenate, cobalt, lithium, rubidium, molybdenum, and mercury did not induce eps production, indicating that alginate biosynthesis is not induced in p. syringae cells exposed to these heavy metals. a 200-kb plasmid designated ppsr12 conferred a stably mucoid phenotype to several p. syringae recipients and also increased their resistance to cobalt and arsenate. a cosmid clone constructed from ppsr12 which conferred a stably mucoid  phenotype to several p. syringae strains but not to pseudomonas aeruginosa was obtained. results obtained in this study indicate that some of the signals and regulatory genes for alginate production in p. syringae differ from those described for alginate production in p. aeruginosa.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the pseudomonas aeruginosa genes algr, algb, and algd reveals a hierarchy of alginate gene expression which is modulated by algt.
AB  == strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa which colonize and infect the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients have a mucoid colony morphology due to the overproduction of the exopolysaccharide alginate. the response regulators algb and algr are required for the transcription of algd, a tightly regulated gene encoding gdp-mannose dehydrogenase, which is critical for p. aeruginosa alginate biosynthesis. previous studies indicated that mutations in the algt gene of mucoid frd1 p. aeruginosa result in nonmucoid derivatives. however, the specific  role for algt in alginate gene regulation has not been elucidated. in this study, transcription of algb, algd, and algr was characterized by gene fusion and primer extension analysis. expression of algr and algd was abolished in p. aeruginosa strains containing algt::tn501 insertions because of lack of transcription initiation at the algr and algd promoters. an algr mutation was constructed in frd1, and this resulted in the loss of alginate production and a dramatic decrease in algd transcription. rna and gene fusion analysis revealed that algb is not required for algr expression, nor is algr necessary for transcription of algb. thus, with the exception of a requirement for algt, the algb and algr pathways appear to be independent of each other. in gel band mobility shift assays, a protein(s) present in extracts from mucoid and algb and algr mutant p.  aeruginosa strains formed a specific complex with algd sequences located immediately upstream of the start of transcription. no binding to these sequences was observed when extracts from algt mutant strains were examined. a model proposed suggests that a hierarchy of alginate gene expression exists in which algt is required for transcription of the response regulators algb and algr, which in turn are necessary for algd expression. algt or a protein under algt control also binds to sequences located within the algd promoter.

AB  == sigma e, an rna polymerase sigma factor of apparent m(r) 28,000, was previously identified by its ability to direct transcription from the p2 promoter of the agarose gene (daga) of streptomyces coelicolor. a degenerate oligonucleotide probe, designed from the n-terminal sequence of purified sigma e, was used to isolate the sigma e gene (sige). the predicted sequence of sigma e shows greatest similarity to sequences of seven other proteins: myxococcus xanthus carq, pseudomonas aeruginosa algu, pseudomonas syringae hrpl, escherichia coli sigma e, alcaligenes eutrophus cnrh, e. coli feci, and bacillus subtilis sigx, a protein of unknown function. these eight proteins define a subfamily of eubacterial rna polymerase factors sufficiently different from other sigma s that, in many cases, they are not identified by standard similarity searching methods. available information suggests that all of them regulate extracytoplasmic functions and that they function as effector molecules responding to extracytoplasmic stimuli.  a. eutrophus cnrh appears to be a plasmid-encoded factor.

AB  == n-terminal sequence analysis of peptides generated by proteolytic treatment of the pseudomonas fluorescens oe 28.3 major outer-membrane protein oprf, embedded in outer membranes or present in whole cells, indicated a surface-exposed location for the proline-rich region of the protein. this region is absent from the p. aeruginosa and p. syringae oprfs. evidence was obtained for the presence of additional exposed but less accessible regions in the carboxy half of oprf. four oprf-specific monoclonal antibodies were all directed to the c-terminal part of the protein but did not recognize a surface-exposed epitope as shown by flow cytometry. our data support the model previously proposed for p. aeruginosa oprf  in which the entire protein is embedded in the outer membrane, unlike the topology proposed for the major outer-membrane protein from escherichia coli, ompa, whose carboxy half resides in the periplasmic space. for six other p. fluorescens strains producing oprf proteins with different isoelectric points, the primary structure was determined by sequence analysis of the pcr-amplified oprf genes. the proline-rich domain represented the most conserved region of the  different p. fluorescens oprfs. based on the sequence of its oprf gene, it was shown that the mushroom pathogen p. tolaasii is quite closely related to p. fluorescens. comparative sequence analysis further showed that the carboxy half of oprf contains a sequence motif that is well conserved in the enterobacterial ompa proteins but is also present in a number of other outer-membrane proteins, including peptidoglycan-associated lipoproteins.

TI  == identification of a putative alternate sigma factor and characterization of a multicomponent regulatory cascade controlling the expression of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae pss61 hrp and hrma genes.
AB  == the pseudomonas syringae hrp and hrma genes controlling pathogenicity and elicitation of the hypersensitive response and the avr genes controlling host range have been shown previously to be regulated by carbon, nitrogen, ph, osmolarity, and hypothetical plant factors. in p. syringae pv. syringae pss61, inactivation of hrp complementation groups ii and xiii reduced expression of a plasmid-borne hrma'-lacz fusion. the hrp regions ii and xiii were cloned on separate plasmids and shown to enhance the activity of the hrma promoter in escherichia coli mc4100 transformants at least 100-fold. the nucleotide sequence  of region xiii revealed two open reading frames (hrpr and hrps) whose deduced products share homology with p. syringae pv. phaseolicola nps3121 hrps and are both related to the ntrc family of two-component signal transduction systems. hrpr and hrps differ from most members of the protein family by lacking an amino-terminal domain which modulates the regulatory activity. a single open reading frame, hrpl, whose product shares homology with algu, a putative alternate sigma factor of p. aeruginosa, as well as with the related alternate sigma factors was identified within region ii. key domains are partially conserved. inactivation of hrps in pss61 repressed expression of a plasmid-borne  hrpl'-lacz fusion carried by pyxpl1r, and transformation of mc4100(pyxpl1r) with  a plasmid carrying hrprs increased hrpl promoter activity at least 200-fold. neither hrps nor hrpr, when cloned on separate plasmids, activated the hrpl promoter activity individually. the expression of hrpl when directed by a lac promoter was sufficient to express a set of plasmid-borne hrma'-, hrpj'-, and hrpz'-lacz fusions independently of other hrp genes. the results indicate that hrprs and hrpl are part of a regulatory cascade in which hrpr and hrps activate expression of hrpl and hrpl, a putative sigma factor, induces expression of hrpl-responsive genes.

TI  == changes in cultivar-specificity toward pea can result from transfer of plasmid rp4 and other incompatibility group p1 replicons to pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi.
AB  == transfer of rp4 and related replicons belonging to the escherichia coli incompatibility group p (pseudomonas aeruginosa incp1) to races 2 and 6 of p. syringae pv. pisi was associated with the creation of two types of transconjugant, one resembling the parental race and the other showing an altered cultivar-specificity towards pea. the latter, irrespective of the parental race,  exhibited a novel pattern of interaction with pea that corresponded to race 4; consequently such transconjugants were termed race 4-like. curing of rp4 did not  affect the phenotype, except in relation to the antibiotic resistances specified  by rp4. the race 4-like strains were non-fluorescent when cultured on appropriate media (in contrast to the particular isolates of races 2 and 6 from which they were derived), showed an enhanced ability to inherit rp4 subsequently (at frequencies up to 10(-1) per recipient) and differed from their parental race in  their pattern of plasmid profile. the plasmid profiles were similar for all race  4-like strains irrespective of origin. there was no evidence that rp4 had recombined with dna in the recipient and probing failed to detect the retention of any part of rp4 in cured strains. the inheritance of the related cosmid vector, plafr3, had similar effects in races 2 and 6. this observation is important since this vector has been widely used to clone avirulence genes in plant pathogenic bacteria. transfer of the incw plasmids s-a and r388 did not cause any changes in the fluorescence or cultivar-specificity of races 2 or 6.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == regions of dna containing promoter sequences from a pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola-specific phage (phi 11p) were identified by shotgun cloning into a broad-host-range promoter-probe vector (pqf70). when used in conjunction with the luciferase reporter genes, one of these dna fragments, 19h, directed gene expression at a level which enabled the subsequent light output (bioluminescence) of single cells of p. syringae pv. phaseolicola to be detected and visualized using a charge-coupled device (ccd). the p. syringae pv. phaseolicola phi 11p, 19h and p. aeruginosa phi pls27, hcm promoters gave a 50-fold increase in bioluminescence (maximum relative light output) compared to similar constructs containing other well-characterized promoters, for example, tetracycline. similar bioluminescent characteristics of the transformed bacterium, were observed during growth with and without antibiotic-selection. when lux+ bacteria were inoculated  onto french bean leaf (phaseolus vulgaris l.), the resultant secondary halo blight lesions were bioluminescent and during phylloplane colonization by the lux+ bacterium, bioluminescence on leaf surfaces was detected and imaged by the ccd. use of these newly identified promoters, combined with the greatly increased sensitivity of bioluminescence detection by the ccd, thus provided a new dimension for the study of natural ecological populations during the bacterial colonization of plants.

TI  == enhancer-like activity of a1gr1-binding site in alginate gene activation: positional, orientational, and sequence specificity.
AB  == significant activation of promoters of alginate genes such as algd or algc occurs in mucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa during its proliferation in the lungs of cystic  fibrosis patients. these promoters have been shown to be responsive to environmental signals such as high osmolarity. the signaling is mediated by a so-called two-component signal transduction system, in which a soluble protein, algr2, undergoes autophosphorylation and transfers the phosphate to a dna-binding response regulator protein, algr1. the phosphorylated form of algr1 has a high affinity for binding at upstream sequences of both the algc and algd promoters. two algr1-binding sites (abs) have been reported upstream of the algc gene. one of the two abss (algc-abs1, located at -94 to -81) is critical for the algc activation process, while the second abs (algc-abs2, located at +161 to +174) is  only weakly active. we now report the presence of a third abs within the structural gene of algc, and this abs (algc-abs3) is also important for algc promoter activation. algc-abs1 can be replaced functionally by algc-abs2, algd-abs1, or algd-abs2 and somewhat weakly by algd-abs3. introduction of a half-integral turn in the dna helix between the algc site of transcription initiation and algc-abs1 allowed only slight reduction of promoter activity, suggesting that the binding site could be appreciably functional even when present in the opposite face of the helix. activation of the algc promoter is independent of the relative location (upstream or downstream of the mrna start site), the number of copies, or the orientation of algc-abs1, suggesting that it  behaves like a eukaryotic enhancer element in promoting transcription from the algc promoter.

TI  == inhibitors of two-component signal transduction systems: inhibition of alginate gene activation in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa strains infecting cystic fibrosis patients often produce copious amounts of the exopolysaccharide alginate. expression of alginate genes in p. aeruginosa is regulated by several proteins including members of the two-component bacterial signal transduction systems. two of these regulatory proteins are algr1, the dna-binding response regulator that transcriptionally activates alginate gene expression, and algr2, the kinase that modifies algr1 via phosphorylation to enhance its activity. in this paper, we report the identification of compounds that inhibit alginate gene expression by inhibiting (i) the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of algr2 and (ii) the dna-binding activity of algr1. compounds with these activities may have potential as components of therapy for eliminating p. aeruginosa infection from the cystic fibrosis lung. in addition, we describe the effect of these compounds on the autophosphorylation activity of other known two-component kinases and show the ability of one compound to significantly inhibit the kinase activities of chea, nrii, and kina.

TI  == alginate synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa: environmental regulation of the algc promoter.
AB  == the exopolysaccharide alginate is a major virulence factor of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that infect the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. the synthesis of alginate is almost uniquely associated with the pathogenicity of p.  aeruginosa within the environment of the cystic fibrosis lung. the gene algc is one of the essential alginate biosynthetic genes and codes for the enzyme phosphomannomutase. in this report, we present data on the transcriptional regulation of algc expression. the activity of the algc promoter is modulated by  the response regulator, algr1, a member of the two-component signal transduction  protein family, which also regulates other alginate-specific promoters. in both mucoid (alginate-positive) and nonmucoid (alginate-negative) p. aeruginosa strains, transcriptional activation of algc increased with the osmolarity of the  culture medium. this osmolarity-induced activation was found to be dependent on algr1. algr1 was found to interact directly with the algc promoter. deletion mapping, in conjunction with mobility shift assays, showed that algr1 specifically bound with two regions of algc upstream dna. a fragment spanning nucleotide positions -378 to -73 showed strong specific binding, while a fragment located between positions -73 and +187 interacted relatively weakly with algr1. phosphorylation of the algr1 protein resulted in the stimulation of its in vitro  ability to bind to the algc promoter region (a fragment spanning nucleotides -378 to -73). transcription from the algc promoter, which has significant homology with the rna polymerase sigma-54 (rpon) recognition sequence, decreased in an rpon mutant of p. aeruginosa.

AB  == the lema gene is conserved among strains and pathovars of pseudomonas syringae. in p. syringae pv. syringae b728a, a causal agent of bacterial brown spot disese  of bean, the lema gene is required for lesion formation on leaves and pods. using lema-containing dna as a probe, we determined that 80 p. syringae pv. syringae strains isolated from bean leaves could be grouped into seven classes based on restriction fragment length polymorphism. marker exchange mutagenesis showed that the lema gene was required for lesion formation by representative strains from each restriction fragment length polymorphism class. hybridization to the lema locus was detected within six different p. syringae pathovars and within pseudomonas aeruginosa. interestingly, a lema homolog was present and functional  within the nonpathogenic strain p. syringae cit7. we cloned a lema homolog from a genomic library of p. syringae pv. phaseolicola nps3121, a causal agent of halo blight of bean, that restored lesion formation to a p. syringae pv. syringae lema mutant. however, a lema mutant p. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain retained the ability to produce halo blight disease symptoms on bean plants. therefore, the lema gene played an essential role in disease lesion formation by p. syringae pv. syringae isolates, but was not required for pathogenicity of a p. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain.

TI  == signal transduction in exopolysaccharide alginate synthesis: phosphorylation of the response regulator algr1 in pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli.
AB  == synthesis of alginate by pseudomonas aeruginosa correlates with its pathogenicity in the lungs of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (cf). alginate synthesis-encoding genes (alg) in p. aeruginosa are normally silent, but are specifically triggered in the cf lung environment. the promoter for the algd gene, located at the upstream end of the alg cluster, is activated by environmental factors such as high osmolarity, nutrient limitation and dehydration. several regulatory proteins are known to control transcription from  the algd promoter. among these proteins is algr1 which is homologous to the phosphorylation-dependent response regulators of the two-component signal transduction system. in this paper, we report that algr2, an 18-kda protein which in cooperation with algr1 regulates the algd promoter, undergoes phosphorylation  in the presence of atp. the phosphate group acquired by algr2 is then transferred to algr1. in addition, we show that algr1 can be phosphorylated by an algr2-analog in escherichia coli. algr1 is isolated in a phosphorylatable 80-kda  complex in association with algr2 in p. aeruginosa and the algr2-analog in e. coli.

AB  == a regulatory protein algr1, previously suggested to be a member of a two-component sensory transduction system because of its homology to ompr and ntrc and its ability to allow activation of the algd promoter under conditions of high osmolarity, has been hyperproduced in escherichia coli after deletion of the upstream region including part of the shine-dalgarno sequence of the algr1 gene and its subsequent cloning under the tac promoter. the algr1 protein is purified  as a monomer, and the sequence of the nine n-terminal amino acids of the monomer  matches with that predicted from the dna sequence of the algr1 gene. the purified algr1 protein binds to two separate dna fragments of the algd upstream region. dnase protection experiments identify these two dna segments as 14-mer sequences  centered at -382 and -458 regions, which contain a common ccgt-tcgtc sequence in  them. while the presence of at least one algr1 binding site is important for the  activation of the algd promoter, the presence of both of the binding sites in the upstream region leads to a higher level of activation.

AB  == the conservation of the oprf gene for the major outer membrane protein oprf was determined by restriction mapping and southern blot hybridization with the pseudomonas aeruginosa oprf gene as a probe. the restriction map was highly conserved among 16 of the 17 serotype strains and 42 clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa. only the serotype 12 isolate and one clinical isolate showed small differences in restriction pattern. southern probing of psti chromosomal digests  of 14 species from the family pseudomonadaceae revealed that only the nine members of rrna homology group i hybridized with the oprf gene. to reveal the actual extent of homology, the oprf gene and its product were characterized in pseudomonas syringae. nine strains of p. syringae from seven different pathovars  hybridized with the p. aeruginosa gene to produce five different but related restriction maps. all produced an oprf protein in their outer membranes with the  same apparent molecular weight as that of p.aeruginosa oprf. in each case the protein reacted with monoclonal antibody ma4-10 and was similarly heat and 2-mercaptoethanol modifiable. the purified oprf protein of the type strain p. syringae pv. syringae atcc 19310 reconstituted small channels in lipid bilayer membranes. the oprf gene from this latter strain was cloned and sequenced. despite the low level of dna hybridization between p. aeruginosa and p. syringae  dna, the oprf gene was highly conserved between the species with 72% dna sequence identity and 68% amino acid sequence identity overall. the carboxy terminus-encoding region of p. syringae oprf showed 85 and 33% identity, respectively, with the same regions of the p. aeruginosa oprf and escherichia coli ompa genes.

TI  == rna polymerases from pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas syringae respond to escherichia coli activator proteins.
AB  == the activities of rna polymerases (rnaps) from pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas syringae were compared with that of escherichia coli rnap. all three  enzymes are able to initiate transcription at the trpba promoter of p. aeruginosa and at the coliphage lambda promoters, prm and pre, in response to heterospecific activators (trpi protein, repressor, and cii protein, respectively). however, both pseudomonas polymerases have less stringent requirements for promoter recognition in the absence of activators than does e. coli rnap.

TI  == formation of polyesters consisting of medium-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids from gluconate by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other fluorescent pseudomonads.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa pao and 15 other strains of this species synthesized a polyester with 3-hydroxydecanoate as the main constituent (55 to 76 mol%) if the  cells were cultivated in the presence of gluconate and if the nitrogen source was exhausted; 3-hydroxyhexanoate, 3-hydroxyoctanoate, and 3-hydroxydodecanoate were  minor constituents of the polymer. the polymer was deposited in granules within the cell and amounted to 70% of the cell dry matter in some strains. among 55 different strains of 41 pseudomonas species tested, p. aureofaciens (21.6% of cellular dry matter), p. citronellolis (78.0%), p. chlororaphis (8.5%), p. marginalis (11.4%), p. mendocina (50.7%), p. putida (33.5%), and pseudomonas sp.  strain dsm 1650 (54.6%) accumulated this type of polymer at significant levels (greater than 5%) during cultivation on gluconate. in two strains of p. facilis and p. fluorescens, as well as in one strain of p. syringae, this polymer was detected as a minor constituent (much less than 5%). all other strains accumulated either poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) or a polymer consisting mainly of 3-hydroxyoctanoate with octanoate but no polyester with gluconate as the carbon source. only a few species (e.g., p. stutzeri) were unable to accumulate poly(hydroxyalkanoic acids) (pha) at all. these results indicated that the formation of pha depends on a pathway which is distinct from all other known pha-biosynthetic pathways. the polyesters accumulated by gluconate- or octanoate-grown cells of recombinant strains of p. aeruginosa and p. putida, which harbored the alcaligenes eutrophus poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)biosynthetic genes, contained 3-hydroxybutyrate as an additional constituent.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the gene from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola encoding the phaseolotoxin-insensitive ornithine carbamoyltransferase.
AB  == the gene coding for the phaseolotoxin-insensitive ornithine carbamoyltransferase  (octase) from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola has been cloned and sequenced. the gene has a deduced coding capacity for a polypeptide with a calculated mr of 36,520 daltons. comparison of the amino acid sequence of the octase enzymes encoded by the p. aeruginosa argf and the escherichia coli argi and argf genes with the deduced sequence of the newly identified gene shows that  79 amino acid residues are strictly conserved in all four polypeptides; among these 7 out of 9 residues are involved in enzyme function. of three amino acid regions that have been implicated in substrate binding or catalysis, two are strictly conserved, and the third involved in carbamoylphosphate binding differs. this correlates well with published data showing that phaseolotoxin competes for  the carbamoylphosphate binding site in the phaseolotoxin-sensitive octases. we propose that the gene be named argk.

TI  == chromosome mapping in pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain ps224.
AB  == a conjugation system for mapping the chromosome of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae ps224 has been developed using the incp-10 plasmid r91-5; pmo22, a tn501-loaded derivative of r91-5; and pmo75, r91-5 loaded with tn5. nine different donor origins were identified with r91-5 and pmo22. by insertion of tn5 into various sites of the chromosome, an additional six donor origins were available using pmo75 as the donor plasmid. in all, 36 markers were located on three linkage groups. many donor strains were unstable and the limited availability of stable donor strains has limited the extent to which markers have been located. this instability of donor strains is in marked contrast to the highly stable donor strains found in p. putida using the same plasmids. as in p.  aeruginosa and p. putida, auxotrophic markers in p. syringae do not show the clustering of related markers found in enterobacteria.

TI  == ornithine carbamoyltransferase genes and phaseolotoxin immunity in pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola.
AB  == two different dna fragments encoding ornithine carbamoyltransferase (octase) were cloned from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola nps3121. these fragments did not cross-hybridize and encoded octases which differed with respect to their sensitivity to purified phaseolotoxin, an octase inhibitor produced by this phytopathogenic bacterium. recombinant plasmids carrying these dna fragments complemented octase-deficient strains of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. extracts of the complemented e. coli strain contained octase enzyme activities with similar degrees of sensitivity to purified phaseolotoxin as extracts of p.s.phaseolicola grown at either 20 or 30 degrees c. the octase activity detectable in extracts of p.s.phaseolicola grown at 20 degrees c is insensitive to phaseolotoxin while that detectable in extracts of cells grown at  30 degrees c is sensitive to the toxin. e.coli hb101 harboring recombinant plasmids carrying the gene(s) encoding the phaseolotoxin-insensitive enzyme activity exhibited resistance to purified phaseolotoxin. the results of tn5 mutagenesis and southern blotting and the pattern of complementation of octase-deficient and tox mutant strains suggest that the gene(s) encoding the phaseolotoxin-insensitive octase is part of a gene cluster involved in phaseolotoxin production.

TI  == characterization of a polysaccharide component of lipopolysaccharide from pseudomonas aeruginosa iid 1008 (atcc 27584) as d-rhamnan.
AB  == structural studies were carried out on a rhamnose-rich polysaccharide isolated from the o-polysaccharide fraction of lipopolysaccharide in pseudomonas aeruginosa iid 1008 (atcc 27584) after destruction of the major o-specific chain  by alkaline treatment. the isolated polysaccharide contained rhamnose, 3-o-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, glucose, xylose, alanine, galactosamine and phosphorus  in a molar ratio of 67:6.9:4.3:2.1:1.1:1.0:4.1. data from analysis involving smith degradation, methylation, 1h-nmr spectroscopy and optical rotation measurement showed that the polysaccharide was built up of three moieties, a rhamnan chain composed of about 70 d-rhamnose residues, the core chain and an oligosaccharide chain comprising 3-o-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, xylose, rhamnose and probably glucose. the repeating unit of the rhamnan chain was indicated to have the following structure:----3)d-rha(alpha 1----3)d-rha(alpha 1----2)d-rha(alpha 1----. this structure is identical with that proposed previously for the repeating unit of the side chain of lipopolysaccharide from plant pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas syringae pv. morsprunorum c28 [smith, a.r.w., zamze, s.e., munro, s.m., carter, k. j. and hignett, r.c.

TI  == mucoid strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are devoid of mannuronan c-5 epimerase.
AB  == mucoid strains of azotobacter vinelandii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas  syringae var glycinia synthesize alginate, an extracellular copolymer comprising  d-mannuronosyl and l-guluronosyl moieties. extracellular mannuronan c-5 epimerase, which converts polymannuronate to alginate, was demonstrated in supernatant fluid from cultures of a. vinelandii. however, the enzyme could not be demonstrated, using the same assay, in supernatant fluids of cultures of mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa or of p. syringae var glycinia, or in cell-free sonic extracts of p. aeruginosa. the results suggest that the pathways of alginate biosynthesis in a. vinelandii and pseudomonas species may differ.

TI  == exopolysaccharides of the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (eps) of the soybean pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea were isolated from culture filtrates and infected soybean leaves. levan  (a polyfructan with a c-2----c-6 backbone and c-2----c-1 branching) or acetylated alginate (a linear polyuronide of c-1----c-4-linked mannuronic and guluronic acids) was isolated from culture filtrates when bacterial strains were grown in a semisynthetic medium containing sucrose or glucose, respectively, as the primary  carbon source. acetylated alginate was the only eps isolated from soybean [glycine max (l.) merr.] leaves inoculated with compatible (disease-inducing) strains of p. syringae pv. glycinea. the acetyl content of the p. syringae pv. glycinea alginates varied from 3 to 14%, and the amount of guluronic acid varied  from less than 1 to 20%. the p. syringae pv. glycinea alginates from in vitro batch cultures were of lower molecular weight and polydispersity than those from  in planta cultures, and both were of lower molecular weights than alginates produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == isolation and characterization of tmpd-oxidase mutants of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == mutants showing negative oxidase-reaction have been isolated from pseudomonas aeruginosa following mutagenesis with n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine. these mutants were compared to the wild type cells with respect to their respiratory activities and cytochrome contents. they exhibit lower respiration rates and contain much less cytochrome c's which are responsible for their weak or negative oxidase-reaction in these mutants. this is supported in part from an initial linear relationship observed between the measured oxidase activities and the lower cytochrome c contents in these mutants. further evidence comes from analyzing oxidase-negative cells of p. syringae, in which low cytochrome c contents similar to these oxidase mutants account for negative oxidase activities. cytochrome o was the sole oxidase found among these mutants as well as in the wild type cell, suggesting that cytochrome c + o complex is responsible for the tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine-oxidase activity in these mutants as the case in the wild-type cells. from the spectral characteristics it seems that all  mutants contain about the same amount and type of terminal oxidase as that of the wild-type cells. the mutation occurred which altered the oxidase activities in these mutants appears to affect cytochrome c gene(s), but not the terminal oxidase gene(s).

TI  == characterization of two surface-localized antigenic sites on porin protein f of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == a rapid colony immunoblot screening procedure was used to demonstrate the surface localization of porin protein f on bacterial colonies of pseudomonas aeruginosa.  by this method, we demonstrated that protein f was accessible to four different specific monoclonal antibodies in a wide variety of both mucoid and nonmucoid p.  aeruginosa strains. controls were performed to demonstrate that, using this procedure, only surface-exposed epitopes bound monoclonal antibodies and that nonspecific binding of monoclonal antibodies either to cells lacking protein f or to mucoid exopolysaccharide did not occur. monoclonal antibodies ma4-4, ma2-10, and ma4-10, specific for protein f, also interacted with colonies of pseudomonas  putida and pseudomonas syringae, whereas the protein f specific monoclonal antibody ma5-8 interacted only with p. aeruginosa strains. using the above-named  monoclonal antibodies, we investigated the antigenic structure of protein f. monoclonal antibodies ma4-4, ma2-10, and ma4-10 bound to 29-31 kilodalton proteolytic fragments produced after papain or trypsin digestion of purified protein f or of protein f in outer membranes or intact cells. antibody ma5-8 did  not interact with proteolytically digested protein f but did interact with two of the six fragments produced after partial cyanogen bromide cleavage of protein f.  antibodies ma4-4, ma2-10, and ma4-10 did not interact with protein f after reduction of its internal disulphide bonds with 2-mercaptoethanol; in contrast, the reactivity of ma5-8 was unaffected. this data suggests that there are at least two distinct highly conserved surface epitopes on porin protein f.

TI  == cloning vectors derived from the pseudomonas plasmid pvs1.
AB  == the pseudomonas plasmid pvs1, which has about seven copies, was reduced to a minimal replicon and used to construct stable gene-cloning vehicles. the host for all cloning experiments was p. aeruginosa strain pao. two nonmobilizable plasmids, pme260 and pme290, and one rp1-mobilizable plasmid, pme285, were constructed. the vectors pme260 (6.3 kb) and pme290 (6.8 kb) carry the tn801 bla  gene specifying carbenicillin (cb) resistance, a good selective marker in pseudomonas, and the tn903 aph gene encoding kanamycin (km) resistance, with useful restriction sites for insertional inactivation. the mob+ vector pme285 (10.6 kb) carries the aph gene and the tn501-derived merrtca genes coding for mercuric ion resistance, another good selective marker in pseudomonas. the hypothetical merd gene, which may follow the mera gene in tn501 but is absent from pme285, appeared to be dispensable for mercuric ion resistance in p. aeruginosa. the mob- vector pme290 could be introduced by transformation and maintained in strains of p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, p. putida, p. acidovorans, p. stutzeri, p. mendocina, p. cepacia, and p. syringae. the plasmid  was compatible with incp-1 and incp-4 replicons.

TI  == differences between lipopolysaccharide compositions of plant pathogenic and saprophytic pseudomonas species.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) were obtained by washing cells of plant pathogenic and  saprophytic pseudomonas species with saline (fraction 1) and then with saline-edta (fraction 2). the cells subsequently were extracted with phenol to yield a third aqueous preparation (fraction 3). each fraction type contained the  lps components, lipid a, heptose, 2-keto-3-deoxy sugar, and neutral and amino sugars. the neutral sugar compositions of fractions 1, 2, and 3, although similar within a species, differed between the pseudomonas species. the lps of two pathovars (pv.) of pseudomonas syringae had glucose and rhamnose as major components: 13 (+/-3)% glucose and 87 (+/-3)% rhamnose for p. syringae pv. pisi and 18 (+/-5)% glucose and 76 (+/-2)% rhamnose for p. syringae pv. syringae. fucose was present in addition to glucose and rhamnose for p. syringae pv. phaseolicola (68 [+/-8]% rhamnose, 14 [+/-1]% fucose, and 14 [+/-5]% glucose) and p. syringae pv. tabaci (24 [+/-2]% rhamnose, 54 [+/-3]% fucose, and 17 [+/-1]% glucose). the lps from different races of p. syringae pv. pisi and p. syringae pv. phaseolicola could not be distinguished by neutral sugar composition. three saprophytic species, p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, also produced  lps which had different proportions of rhamnose, fucose, and glucose. the lps from three isolates of p. putida were distinct in possessing a high proportion of amino sugar and containing glucose as the major neutral sugar component (86 to 100%). the lps fractions from plant pathogenic and saprophytic pseudomonas species did not elicit browning or phytoalexin production in treated dark red kidney bean cotyledons or red mexican bean leaves. rather, chlorosis of the lps-treated leaf tissue was observed.

TI  == genetic and molecular characterization of the pseudomonas plasmid pvs1.
AB  == a restriction map of the 30-kb nonconjugative pseudomonas plasmid pvs1 was constructed. derivatives of pvs1 obtained in vitro by successive deletions were used to localize on the physical map the determinant for resistance to mercuric ions (carried by transposon tn501), the gene(s) encoding sulfonamide resistance,  a 1.6-kb region affecting plasmid stability and establishment in p. fluorescens atcc 13525, and a segment required for mobilization of pvs1 by plasmid rp1. the sulfonamide resistance determinant of pvs1 appeared to be closely related to that of transposon tn21. a mini-pvs1 replicon, pme259, consisting of an essential 1.55-kb segment (designated rep and thought to carry the origin of replication) and a mercury resistance determinant was able to replicate p. aeruginosa pao but  selective pressure was needed for plasmid maintenance. the copy number of pvs1 derivatives was estimated to be 6-8 per chromosome equivalent. plasmids possessing the essential rep segment plus the adjacent stability region could be  established in strains of p. aeruginosa, p. putida, p. fluorescens, p. acidovorans, p. cepacia, p. mendocina, p. stutzeri, p. syringae, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and rhizobium leguminosarum.

TI  == pseudomonas stutzeri and related species undergo natural transformation.
AB  == cells of pseudomonas stutzeri are naturally transformed by homologous chromosomal dna; they do not require chemical treatment to become competent. this capacity to undergo natural transformation was found to be shared by the closely related species p. mendocina, p. alcaligenes, and p. pseudoalcaligenes, but was not detectable in strains of p. aeruginosa, p. perfectomarinus, p. putida, p. fluorescens, or p. syringae. p. stutzeri could be transformed either on plates or in liquid medium. only double-stranded chromosomal dna was effective; single-stranded dna and plasmid dna were not. dna fragments larger than 10 kilobase pairs were more effective than smaller fragments. the transformation frequency was proportional to dna concentration from 1 ng/ml to 1 microgram/ml; higher concentrations were saturating. the maximum frequency, about 10(-4) transformants per recipient cell, was obtained with cells from a culture in the early stationary growth phase. a variety of chromosomal mutations have been transformed, including mutations to auxotrophy and to antibiotic resistance. other systems for genetic exchange in p. stutzeri have not yet been found; transformation offers a means for the genetic analysis of this metabolically versatile organism.
