antimicrobial activities of indole alkaloids from tabernaemontana catharinensis.
tabernaemontana catharinensis root bark ethanol extract, eb2 fraction and the mmv alkaloid (12-methoxy-4-methylvoachalotine) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities. t. catharinensis ethanol extract was effective against both strains of the dermatophyte trichophyton rubrum at concentrations of 2.5 mg/ml (wild strain) and 1.25 mg/ml (mutant strain), while the eb2 fraction and mmv alkaloid showed a strong antifungal activity against wild and mutant strains with mic values of <0.02 and 0.16 mg/ml, respectively. the eb2 fraction showed a strong antibacterial activity against atcc strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa with mics from <0.02 to 0.04 mg/ml, as well as against resistant clinical isolates species of enterococcus sp, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa with mic values ranging from 0.04 to 0.08 mg/ml. the mmv alkaloid presented a mic of 0.16 mg/ml against the strains of s. aureus and e. coli atcc. for the resistant clinical isolates enterococcus sp, citrobacter, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa the mic of mmv ranged from 0.08 to 0.31 mg/ml. the chromatography analysis of the eb2 fraction revealed the presence of indole alkaloids, including mmv, possibly responsible for the observed antimicrobial activity.
antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four gram-positive and sixteen gram-negative bacteria. dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant serratia sp., proteus vulgaris, p. rettgeri and klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria including escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogens, e. cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and campylobacter jejunii. dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including aac(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
