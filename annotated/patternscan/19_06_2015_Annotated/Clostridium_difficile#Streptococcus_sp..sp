TI  == kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial dna replication enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile. we have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. we report the mic50s, mic90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. we confirm the gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (mic90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the gram-negative nonfermenter acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. we confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. we also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in pseudomonas, though it is in escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in older patients: a systematic review.
AB  == objective: here, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotic interventions in prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) and clostridium difficile diarrhoea (cdd) in older patients. methods: pubmed, embase, central, cinahl, and  web of science were comprehensively searched from their dates of inception to may 2014. only randomised controlled trials reporting data on probiotics including lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, saccharomyces, streptococcus, enterococcus, and bacillus-alone or in combination-versus placebo or absence of treatment in older  patients (age >/=65 years) were included. risk ratios (rrs) for aad and cdd relative to placebo or absence of treatment were estimated. results: six trials with a total of 3562 patients were included. only one trial showed that bacillus  licheniformis was effective for preventing aad in older patients. however, there  was no preventive effect for aad and cdd with lactobacillus acidophilus (florajen), lactobacillus casei shirota, saccharomyces cerevisiae (boulardii) lyo, mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum (cultech strains), and mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus cul60, cul21, bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20 and b. lactis cul34. conclusions: our findings indicate that probiotics may not reduce the risk of aad and cdd in older patients. however, with current published data, it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions. to confirm these findings, sample sizes, multi-centre, double-blind studies that consider factors such as probiotic strains and types of antibiotics are required.

TI  == influence of sequence mismatches on the specificity of recombinase polymerase amplification technology.
AB  == recombinase polymerase amplification (rpa) technology relies on three major proteins, recombinase proteins, single-strand binding proteins, and polymerases,  to specifically amplify nucleic acid sequences in an isothermal format. the performance of rpa with respect to sequence mismatches of closely-related non-target molecules is not well documented and the influence of the number and distribution of mismatches in dna sequences on rpa amplification reaction is not  well understood. we investigated the specificity of rpa by testing closely-related species bearing naturally occurring mismatches for the tuf gene sequence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or mycobacterium tuberculosis and for the  cfb gene sequence of streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, the impact of the number and distribution of mismatches on rpa efficiency was assessed by synthetically generating 14 types of mismatched forward primers for detecting five bacterial species of high diagnostic relevance such as clostridium difficile, staphylococcus aureus, s. agalactiae, p. aeruginosa, and m. tuberculosis as well as bacillus atropheus subsp. globigii for which we use the spores as internal control in diagnostic assays. a total of 87 mismatched primers were tested in this study. we observed that target specific rpa primers with mismatches (n > 1) at their 3'extrimity hampered rpa reaction. in addition, 3 mismatches covering both extremities and the center of the primer sequence negatively affected rpa yield. we demonstrated that the specificity of rpa was multifactorial. therefore its application in clinical settings must be selected and validated a priori. we recommend that the selection of a target gene must consider the presence of closely-related non-target genes. it is advisable to choose target regions with a high number of mismatches (>/=36%, relative to the size of amplicon) with respect to closely-related species and the best case scenario would be by choosing a unique target gene.

TI  == evaluation of an online program to teach microbiology to internal medicine residents.
AB  == microbiology rounds are an integral part of infectious disease consultation service. during microbiology rounds, we highlight microbiology principles using vignettes. we created case-based, interactive, microbiology online modules similar to the vignettes presented during microbiology rounds. since internal medicine residents rotating on our infectious disease elective have limited time  to participate in rounds and learn microbiology, our objective was to evaluate the use of the microbiology online modules by internal medicine residents. we asked residents to complete 10 of 25 online modules during their infectious disease elective. we evaluated which modules they chose and the change in their knowledge level. forty-six internal medicine residents completed assessments given before and after accessing the modules with an average of 11/20 (range, 6 to 19) and 16/20 (range, 9 to 20) correct questions, respectively (average improvement, 5 questions; p = 0.0001). the modules accessed by more than 30 residents included those related to clostridium difficile, anaerobes, candida spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and neisseria meningitidis. we demonstrated improved microbiology knowledge after completion of the online modules. this improvement may not be solely attributed to completing the online modules, as fellows and faculty may have provided additional microbiology education during the rotation.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == antiinfective therapy with a small molecule inhibitor of staphylococcus aureus sortase.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is the most frequent cause of  hospital-acquired infection, which manifests as surgical site infections, bacteremia, and sepsis. due to drug-resistance, prophylaxis of mrsa infection with antibiotics frequently fails or incites nosocomial diseases such as clostridium difficile infection. sortase a is a transpeptidase that anchors surface proteins in the envelope of s. aureus, and sortase mutants are unable to  cause bacteremia or sepsis in mice. here we used virtual screening and optimization of inhibitor structure to identify 3-(4-pyridinyl)-6-(2-sodiumsulfonatephenyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazo le and related compounds, which block sortase activity in vitro and in vivo. sortase inhibitors do not affect in vitro staphylococcal growth yet protect mice  against lethal s. aureus bacteremia. thus, sortase inhibitors may be useful as antiinfective therapy to prevent hospital-acquired s. aureus infection in high-risk patients without the side effects of antibiotics.

TI  == the human volatilome: volatile organic compounds (vocs) in exhaled breath, skin emanations, urine, feces and saliva.
AB  == breath analysis is a young field of research with its roots in antiquity. antoine lavoisier discovered carbon dioxide in exhaled breath during the period 1777-1783, wilhelm (vilem) petters discovered acetone in breath in 1857 and johannes muller reported the first quantitative measurements of acetone in 1898.  a recent review reported 1765 volatile compounds appearing in exhaled breath, skin emanations, urine, saliva, human breast milk, blood and feces. for a large number of compounds, real-time analysis of exhaled breath or skin emanations has  been performed, e.g., during exertion of effort on a stationary bicycle or during sleep. volatile compounds in exhaled breath, which record historical exposure, are called the 'exposome'. changes in biogenic volatile organic compound concentrations can be used to mirror metabolic or (patho)physiological processes  in the whole body or blood concentrations of drugs (e.g. propofol) in clinical settings-even during artificial ventilation or during surgery. also compounds released by bacterial strains like pseudomonas aeruginosa or streptococcus pneumonia could be very interesting. methyl methacrylate (cas 80-62-6), for example, was observed in the headspace of streptococcus pneumonia in concentrations up to 1420 ppb. fecal volatiles have been implicated in differentiating certain infectious bowel diseases such as clostridium difficile,  campylobacter, salmonella and cholera. they have also been used to differentiate  other non-infectious conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. in addition, alterations in urine volatiles have been used to detect urinary tract infections, bladder, prostate and other cancers. peroxidation of lipids and other biomolecules by reactive oxygen species produce  volatile compounds like ethane and 1-pentane. noninvasive detection and therapeutic monitoring of oxidative stress would be highly desirable in autoimmunological, neurological, inflammatory diseases and cancer, but also during surgery and in intensive care units. the investigation of cell cultures opens up new possibilities for elucidation of the biochemical background of volatile compounds. in future studies, combined investigations of a particular compound with regard to human matrices such as breath, urine, saliva and cell culture investigations will lead to novel scientific progress in the field.

TI  == establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the food and drug administration safety and innovation act. final rule.
AB  == the food and drug administration (fda or agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. this final rule implements a provision of the generating antibiotic incentives now (gain) title of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act (fdasia). gain is intended to encourage  development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of  exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, fda has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' acinetobacter species, aspergillus species, burkholderia cepacia complex, campylobacter species, candida species, clostridium difficile, coccidioides species, cryptococcus species, enterobacteriaceae (e.g.,  klebsiella pneumoniae), enterococcus species, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium  tuberculosis complex, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, pseudomonas species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and vibrio cholerae. the preamble to the  proposed rule described the factors the agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. as described in the preamble of this final rule, fda applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.

TI  == species and genus level resolution analysis of gut microbiota in clostridium difficile patients following fecal microbiota transplantation.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile is an opportunistic human intestinal pathogen,  and c. difficile infection (cdi) is one of the main causes of antibiotic-induced  diarrhea and colitis. one successful approach to combat cdi, particularly recurrent form of cdi, is through transplantation of fecal microbiota from a healthy donor to the infected patient. in this study we investigated the distal gut microbial communities of three cdi patients before and after fecal microbiota transplantation, and we compared these communities to the composition of the donor's fecal microbiota. we utilized phylogenetic microbiota array, high-throughput illumina sequencing, and fluorescent in situ hybridization to profile microbiota composition down to the genus and species level resolution. results: the original patients' microbiota had low diversity, was dominated by members of gammaproteobacteria and bacilli, and had low numbers of clostridia and bacteroidia. at the genus level, fecal samples of cdi patients were rich in members of the lactobacillus, streptococcus, and enterobacter genera. in comparison, the donor community was dominated by clostridia and had significantly higher diversity and evenness. the patients' distal gut communities were completely transformed within 3 days following fecal transplantation, and these communities remained stable in each patient for at least 4 months. despite compositional differences among recipients' pre-treatment gut microbiota, the transplanted gut communities were highly similar among recipients post-transplantation, were indistinguishable from that of the donor, and were rich in members of blautia, coprococcus, and faecalibacterium. in each case, the  gut microbiota restoration led to a complete patient recovery and symptom alleviation. conclusion: we conclude that c. difficile infection can be successfully treated by fecal microbiota transplantation and that this leads to stable transformation of the distal gut microbial community from the one abundant in aerotolerant species to that dominated by members of the clostridia.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

AB  == primary bacterial peritonitis is a rare complication of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (ins) in children, found in 1.5-3.7% cases. the 10-year-old girl was admitted with ins relapse: generalized edema, proteinuria 630 mg/kg/24 h, hypoalbuminemia 1.8 g/dl, hypogammaglobulinemia 74.0 mg/dl (n: 618-1537 mg/dl), gfr 71.6 ml/min/1.73 m2. she was treated with prednisone 60 mg/24 h. on 5th day severe pain, fever, crp (15.5 mg/dl) and leukocytosis (19.5 tys/mm3) rise occurred. on 6th day due to suspicion of peritonitis, laparotomy was performed and 400 ml of suppurative exudate was evacuated (streptococcus pneumoniae was cultured). postoperative course was complicated with acute kidney injury (gfr 47.7 ml/min/ 1.73 m2), lung edema, arterial hypertension, and separation of the layers of a surgical wound. the patient was treated with: imipenem (9 days), vancomycine i.v. (4 days)/p.o. (11 days) (clostridium difficile toxin present in  stool), fluconazole (14 days), 20% albumins, furosemide, labetalole, cyclosporine a (started on 56th day after the operation due to secondary steroid-resistance of ins). the remission was achieved after 7 days of cyclosporine a treatment. authors suggest that children with nephrotic syndrome belong to high-risk group of invasive pneumococcal disease, therefore they require careful implementation of mandatory immunization schedule. peritonitis is a rare and still dangerous infectious complication of nephrotic syndrome in children.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == biological evaluation of benzothiazole ethyl urea inhibitors of bacterial type ii topoisomerases.
AB  == the type ii topoisomerases dna gyrase (gyra/gyrb) and topoisomerase iv (parc/pare) are well-validated targets for antibacterial drug discovery. because  of their structural and functional homology, these enzymes are amenable to dual targeting by a single ligand. in this study, two novel benzothiazole ethyl urea-based small molecules, designated compound a and compound b, were evaluated  for their biochemical, antibacterial, and pharmacokinetic properties. the two compounds inhibited the atpase activity of gyrb and pare with 50% inhibitory concentrations of <0.1 mug/ml. prevention of dna supercoiling by dna gyrase was also observed. both compounds potently inhibited the growth of a range of bacterial organisms, including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, clostridium difficile, and selected gram-negative respiratory pathogens. mic90s against clinical isolates ranged from 0.015 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae to 0.25 mug/ml for staphylococcus aureus. no cross-resistance with common drug resistance phenotypes was observed. in addition, no synergistic or antagonistic interactions between compound a or compound b and other antibiotics, including the topoisomerase inhibitors novobiocin and levofloxacin, were detected in checkerboard experiments. the frequencies of spontaneous resistance for s. aureus were <2.3 x 10(-10) with compound a and <5.8 x 10(-11) with compound b at concentrations equivalent to 8x the mics. these values indicate a multitargeting  mechanism of action. the pharmacokinetic properties of both compounds were profiled in rats. following intravenous administration, compound b showed approximately 3-fold improvement over compound a in terms of both clearance and the area under the concentration-time curve. the measured oral bioavailability of compound b was 47.7%.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil: a review of its use in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil (zinforo, teflaro), is an advanced-generation, parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa. ceftaroline has demonstrated a low potential for the selection of resistance in vitro for drug-resistant gram-positive organisms, including mrsa, as well as for gram-negative respiratory pathogens. in pivotal phase iii studies, intravenous ceftaroline fosamil demonstrated noninferiority to intravenous vancomycin plus aztreonam in patients hospitalized with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csstis) and intravenous ceftriaxone in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) [pneumonia outcomes research team (port) risk  class iii or iv]; however, patients with cap admitted to the intensive care unit  were not evaluated. ceftaroline fosamil was generally well tolerated in these trials, with an adverse event profile similar to that of other cephalosporins. diarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, the risk of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea with ceftaroline fosamil appeared to be low. potential limitations of the drug include the lack of an oral formulation and the requirement for twice-daily administration. nonetheless, ceftaroline fosamil represents an attractive option (either alone or in combination with other agents) for the initial empirical treatment of patients hospitalized with csstis (including those with suspected mrsa infection) or cap (port risk class iii or iv) who require intravenous antimicrobial therapy. as with all antibacterial agents, ceftaroline fosamil should be used in accordance with good  antimicrobial stewardship.

TI  == site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans, strain jh1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. more specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type  a(i) lanthipeptides. mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pva891. substitutions of the n-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in  ring a and intertwined rings c and d were investigated. a truncation and insertion of residues in ring a and intertwined rings c and d were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain micrococcus luteus atcc 10240. mics against streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 27336, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, clostridium difficile uk1, and micrococcus luteus atcc 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the m. luteus bioassay. this mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.

TI  == sequencing of bacterial genomes: principles and insights into pathogenesis and development of antibiotics.
AB  == the impact of bacterial diseases on public health has become enormous, and is partly due to the increasing trend of antibiotic resistance displayed by bacterial pathogens. sequencing of bacterial genomes has significantly improved our understanding about the biology of many bacterial pathogens as well as identification of novel antibiotic targets. since the advent of genome sequencing two decades ago, about 1,800 bacterial genomes have been fully sequenced and these include important aetiological agents such as streptococcus pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli o157:h7, vibrio cholerae, clostridium difficile and staphylococcus aureus. very recently, there has been an explosion of bacterial genome data and is due to the development of next generation sequencing technologies, which are evolving so rapidly. indeed, the field of microbial genomics is advancing at a very fast rate and it is difficult  for researchers to be abreast with the new developments. this highlights the need for regular updates in microbial genomics through comprehensive reviews. this review paper seeks to provide an update on bacterial genome sequencing generally, and to analyze insights gained from sequencing in two areas, including bacterial  pathogenesis and the development of antibiotics.

TI  == current and future challenges in the development of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == micro-organisms exist to survive. even in the absence of antimicrobial agents, many have determinants of resistance that may be expressed phenotypically, should the need arise. with the advent of the antibiotic age, as more and more drugs were developed to treat serious infections, micro-organisms (particularly bacteria) rapidly developed resistance determinants to prevent their own demise.the most important determinants of resistance have been in the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. among gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) have taxed researchers and pharmaceutical companies to develop new agents that are effective against these resistant strains. among the gram-negative bacteria, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) enzymes, carbapenemases (cres) and the so-called amp-c enzymes that may be readily transferred between species of enterobacteriaceae and other facultative species have created multi-drug resistant organisms that are difficult to treat. other resistance determinants have been seen in other clinically important bacterial species such as neisseria  gonorrhoeae, clostridium difficile, haemophilus influenzae and mycobacterium tuberculosis. these issues have now spread to fungal agents of infection.a variety of modalities have been used to stem the tide of resistance. these include the development of niche compounds that target specific resistance determinants. other approaches have been to find new targets for antimicrobial activity, use of combination agents that are effective against more than one target in the cell, or new delivery mechanism to maximize the concentration of antimicrobial agents at the site of infection without causing toxicity to the host. it is important that such new modalities have been proved effective for clinical therapy. animal models and non-mammalian systems have been developed to  determine if new agents will reach sufficient concentrations at infection sites to predict clinical efficacy without toxicity. it will also be key to consider antimicrobial stewardship as an important component of the continuing battle to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == the impact of infection on population health: results of the ontario burden of infectious diseases study.
AB  == background: evidence-based priority setting is increasingly important for rationally distributing scarce health resources and for guiding future health research. we sought to quantify the contribution of a wide range of infectious diseases to the overall infectious disease burden in a high-income setting. methodology/principal findings: we used health-adjusted life years (halys), a composite measure comprising premature mortality and reduced functioning due to disease, to estimate the burden of 51 infectious diseases and associated syndromes in ontario using 2005-2007 data. deaths were estimated from vital statistics data and disease incidence was estimated from reportable disease, healthcare utilization, and cancer registry data, supplemented by local modeling  studies and national and international epidemiologic studies. the 51 infectious agents and associated syndromes accounted for 729 lost halys, 44.2 deaths, and 58,987 incident cases per 100,000 population annually. the most burdensome infectious agents were: hepatitis c virus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia  coli, human papillomavirus, hepatitis b virus, human immunodeficiency virus, staphylococcus aureus, influenza virus, clostridium difficile, and rhinovirus. the top five, ten, and 20 pathogens accounted for 46%, 67%, and 75% of the total  infectious disease burden, respectively. marked sex-specific differences in disease burden were observed for some pathogens. the main limitations of this study were the exclusion of certain infectious diseases due to data availability  issues, not considering the impact of co-infections and co-morbidity, and the inability to assess the burden of milder infections that do not result in healthcare utilization. conclusions/significance: infectious diseases continue to cause a substantial health burden in high-income settings such as ontario. most of this burden is attributable to a relatively small number of infectious agents, for which many effective interventions have been previously identified. therefore, these findings should be used to guide public health policy, planning, and research.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a range of probiotics against pathogens: evidence for the effects of organic acids.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of fifteen  selected strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. in vitro antibacterial activity was initially investigated by an agar spot method. results from the agar spot test showed that most of the selected strains were able to produce active compounds on solid media with antagonistic properties against salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile. these results were also confirmed when cell-free culture supernatants (cfcs) from the putative probiotics were used in an agar well diffusion assay. neutralization of  the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antagonistic effects. these experiments are able to confirm the capacity of potential probiotics to inhibit selected pathogens. one of the main inhibitory mechanisms may result from the production of organic acids from glucose fermentation and consequent lowering of  culture ph. this observation was confirmed when the profile of organic acids was  analysed demonstrating that lactic and acetic acid were the principal end products of probiotic metabolism. furthermore, the assessment of the haemolytic activity and the susceptibility of the strains to the most commonly used antimicrobials, considered as basic safety aspects, were also studied. the observed antimicrobial activity was mainly genus-specific, additionally significant differences could be observed among species.

TI  == lactic acid production by streptococcus thermophilus alters clostridium difficile infection and in vitro toxin a production.
AB  == antibiotic treatment to treat specific infections has the potential to effectively target the offending microbe as well as other microbes that colonize  sites within a host. antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) is a classic example resulting from disruption of host microbial communities; 20% of patients with aad are likely to become colonized with clostridium difficile. restoration of a "normal" microbial community within the host using probiotic bacteria is one approach to circumvent aad and c. difficile infection. the goals of this study were to assess the interactions between streptococcus thermophilus, a potential probiotic organism and c. difficile using both in vitro and in vivo systems. exposure of c. difficile to filtered supernatants from s. thermophilus showed a dose-dependent, bactericidal effect due to lactic acid. additional studies show that levels of lactic acid (10 mm) that did not inhibit bacterial growth had the  potential to decrease tcda expression and tcda release into the extracellular milieu. in vivo, treatment with viable s. thermophilus significantly increased luminal levels of lactate in the cecum compared with uv-irradiated s. thermophilus. in the context of infection with c. difficile, mice treated with viable s. thermophilus exhibited 46% less weight loss compared with untreated controls; moreover, less pathology, diarrhea, and lower detectable toxin levels in cecal contents were evident more often in s. thermophillus treated mice. a significant, inverse correlation (spearman r = -0.942, p = 0.017) between the levels of luminal lactate and abundance of c. difficile were noted suggesting that lactate produced by s. thermophilus is a factor impacting the progression of c. difficile infection in the murine system.

TI  == antibiotic optimization and chemical structure stabilization of thiomuracin a.
AB  == synthetic studies of the antimicrobial secondary metabolite thiomuracin a (1) were initiated to improve chemical stability and physicochemical properties. functional group modifications of 1 included removing the c2-c7 side chain, derivatizing the c84 epoxide region, and altering the c44 hydroxyphenylalanine motif. the resulting derivatives simplified and stabilized the chemical structure and were evaluated for antibacterial activity relative to 1. the simplified structure and improved organic solubility of the derivatives facilitated isolation yields from fermentation broths and simplified the procedures involved  for the process. these advancements increased material supply for continued medicinal chemistry optimization and culminated in the identification of 2, a structurally simplified and chemically stable analogue of 1 which retained potent antibiotic activity.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == discovery of lff571: an investigational agent for clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == clostridium difficile (c. difficile) is a gram positive, anaerobic bacterium that infects the lumen of the large intestine and produces toxins. this results in a range of syndromes from mild diarrhea to severe toxic megacolon and death. alarmingly, the prevalence and severity of c. difficile infection are increasing; thus, associated morbidity and mortality rates are rising. 4-aminothiazolyl analogues of the antibiotic natural product ge2270 a (1) were designed, synthesized, and optimized for the treatment of c. difficile infection. the medicinal chemistry effort focused on enhancing aqueous solubility relative to that of the natural product and previous development candidates (2, 3) and improving antibacterial activity. structure-activity relationships, cocrystallographic interactions, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in animal models  of infection were characterized. these studies identified a series of dicarboxylic acid derivatives, which enhanced solubility/efficacy profile by several orders of magnitude compared to previously studied compounds and led to the selection of lff571 (4) as an investigational new drug for treating c. difficile infection.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == mortality and associated risk factors in consecutive patients admitted to a uk nhs trust with community acquired bacteraemia.
AB  == purpose: within the uk, there is lack of contemporary data on clinical outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with severe community acquired infection. the purpose of this study was to determine outcomes and risk factors associated with  mortality in consecutive patients admitted to a uk nhs trust with community acquired infections that cause bacteraemia. methods: from september 2007 to august 2008, demographic, clinical and microbiological data were collected on patients with laboratory confirmed bacteraemia. multivariate logistic regression  was used to determine the association between predicted variables and likelihood  of death. results: 686 bacteraemic episodes occurred in 681 patients. the most common sites of infection were non-catheter associated urinary tract infections (140, 20.4%) and biliary tract infections (62, 9.1%). the most common organisms were escherichia coli (238, 34.7%), staphylococcus aureus (84, 12.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (40, 5.8%). of the e coli infections, extended spectrum  beta-lactamase (esbl) producers accounted for 21/238 (8.8%), and of the s aureus  infections, methicillin resistant s aureus (mrsa) accounted for 14/84 (16.7%). 124 (18.2%, 95% ci 15.3% to 21.1%) people died within 7 days and 170 (25.0%, 95%  ci 21.7% to 28.2%) within 30 days. age (or 2.17, 95% ci 1.54 to 3.06), charlson comorbidity index (or 1.21, 95% ci 1.10 to 1.34), and pitt score (or 1.49, 95% ci 1.32 to 1.67) were highly significantly associated with 30 day mortality (p<0.001). delay in appropriate antibiotic treatment (or 1.35, 95% ci 1.05 to 1.75) and an undefined site of infection (or 2.05, 95% ci 1.19 to 3.53) were less significantly associated with 30 day mortality (p<0.05). conclusion: the 30 day mortality rate in consecutive patients with community acquired bacteraemic infection was 25.0%. these figures could be used as performance indicators to compare outcomes in different uk nhs trusts. with the exception of delay in appropriate antibiotic treatment, predictors of mortality at 30 days were non-modifiable.

TI  == [the use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of infectious diseases].
AB  == the use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of infectious diseases has a long tradition. initially immunoglobulins from hyperimmunised animals were used for their antitoxic and antimicrobial activity. the development of preparations of human intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) and the observations of their long-term use enabled to assess their usefulness in the treatment of the diseases of proven or probable infectious etiology. in the treatment of infectious diseases ivig are currently used as immunomodulating drugs or immunosuppressive therapy, more frequently than the specific antibodies against the viruses, bacteria or their toxins. in practice of the infectious ward ivig are used as a drug of choice in the treatment of kawasaki disease, in toxic epidermolysis and stevens-johnson syndrome. as adjunctive therapy ivig are used in the infection with parvovirus b19, in hemophagocytic syndrome, for treatment of infections presenting with a severe toxemia caused by clostridium difficile, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the rationale for the use of ivig may be also serious infections caused by enteroviruses, particularly neuroinfections. the use of ivig in the treatment of sepsis is controversial, since their effectiveness is not proven.

AB  == objectives: the aim of the study was to investigate the previously unexplored diversity of neonatal intestinal microbiota and monitor early intestinal colonization patterns in korean preterm infants using high-throughput pyrosequencing technology combined with 16s rdna-based molecular methods. subjects and methods: a total of 46,369 partial 16s rdna sequences obtained from  30 fecal samples serially taken from 10 very-low-birth weight preterm infants were analyzed. results: a significant proportion of the molecular species (21.9%) was found to be unclassified. the pathogenic or potentially pathogenic molecular  species belonging to the classes gammaproteobacteria and bacilli were predominant during the entire observation period. anaerobic or nonpathogenic molecular species belonging to the class clostridia (except clostridium difficile) and phyla bacteroidetes were ubiquitous even within 72 hours after birth. the proportion of these species increased significantly at 1 month of age. the most ubiquitous and abundant major molecular genera common to all of the postnatal ages were escherichia, enterobacter, enterococcus, veillonella, serratia, staphylococcus, roseburia, acinetobacter, citrobacter, bacteroides, faecalibacterium, blautia, and streptococcus. conclusions: the diversity and dynamic nature of intestinal bacterial colonization in very-low-birth weight preterm infants were revealed using pyrosequencing technology. the results of the present pilot study may provide a basis to consider when investigating or interpreting the role of intestinal microbiota in certain preterm infant diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis or systemic infection.

TI  == tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. it is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). conjugative transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. the ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

TI  == complete genome sequence of a serotype 11a, st62 streptococcus pneumoniae invasive isolate.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen representing  a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. we sequenced the genome of a  serotype 11a, st62 s. pneumoniae invasive isolate (ap200), that was erythromycin-resistant due to the presence of the erm(tr) determinant, and carried out analysis of the genome organization and comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. results: the genome sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 is 2,130,580 base pair in length. the genome carries 2216 coding sequences (cds), 56 trna, and 12 rrna genes. of the cdss, 72.9% have a predicted biological known function. ap200 contains the pilus islet 2 and, although its phenotype corresponds to serotype 11a, it contains an 11d capsular locus. chromosomal rearrangements resulting from a large inversion across the replication axis, and  horizontal gene transfer events were observed. the chromosomal inversion is likely implicated in the rebalance of the chromosomal architecture affected by the insertions of two large exogenous elements, the erm(tr)-carrying tn1806 and a functional prophage designated phispn_200. tn1806 is 52,457 bp in size and comprises 49 orfs. comparative analysis of tn1806 revealed the presence of a similar genetic element or part of it in related species such as streptococcus pyogenes and also in the anaerobic species finegoldia magna, anaerococcus prevotii and clostridium difficile. the genome of phispn_200 is 35,989 bp in size and is organized in 47 orfs grouped into five functional modules. prophages similar to phispn_200 were found in pneumococci and in other streptococcal species, showing a high degree of exchange of functional modules. phispn_200 viral particles have morphologic characteristics typical of the siphoviridae family and are capable of infecting a pneumococcal recipient strain. conclusions: the sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 chromosome revealed a dynamic genome, characterized by chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. the overall diversity of ap200 is driven mainly by the presence of the exogenous elements tn1806 and phispn_200 that show large gene exchanges with other genetic  elements of different bacterial species. these genetic elements likely provide ap200 with additional genes, such as those conferring antibiotic-resistance, promoting its adaptation to the environment.

AB  == objective: the objectives of this multicenter study are to evaluate current clinical practices in cardiac surgery concerning the prevention and management of sternal wound infections, to identify room for improvement, and to support implementation of systematic measures. methods: as a part of a campaign for infection prevention in cardiac surgery in germany, a multiple-choice questionnaire with two main sections was developed and submitted to all cardiac surgery units in germany (79). the project was realized in cooperation with the german society for thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, the bqs institute for quality and patient safety, and the national reference center for nosocomial infection surveillance. results: a representative number (54 of 79 or 68%) of german cardiac surgery centers participated in the survey, in which heterogeneous procedures and various standards for prevention were observed. surveillance, standards, and advanced training regarding hygiene measures are present in almost all participating hospitals. methicillin-resistant streptococcus aureus (mrsa) screening is performed in 81.5% (44/54) of all participating departments. a little less than one-tenth (7.4%) perform decolonization measures on all patients, while 85.2% perform decolonization measures only on mrsa-positive patients. application of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis ranges from single-shot application to 3 days of treatment. longer treatment is expensive and time-intensive, and also increases the risk of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. nearly three-quarters (70.4%) of all participating hospitals perform preoperative hair removal 1 day before surgery. common techniques are clipping machines (53.7%), razors (40.7%), clipping machines and depilatory cream (1.9%),  or depilatory cream only (1.9%). remanent (37.0%) and non-remanent disinfectants  (55.6%) are used for preoperative skin disinfection. the time of the first wound-dressing change varies from the day of surgery (1.9%) over the first (42.6%) or second (46.3%) day after surgery to up to 3 or more days after surgery (9.3%). conclusions: the results of the evaluation show that basic measures for infection prevention in cardiac surgery in germany are well implemented. nevertheless, a relevant heterogeneity in the use of special measures was observed, although research-based guidelines for infection prevention in surgery  do exist and many studies have demonstrated the usefulness and feasibility of these measures.

TI  == comparative genome-wide analysis of small rnas of major gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  == in the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. the detection of small rnas (srnas) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. several experimental technologies to predict srna have been established for the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli. in many respects, srna screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of srnas for gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of srnas in colonization and pathogenicity for listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. here, we report  the current knowledge about the srnas of these socioeconomically relevant gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput srna screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide srna identification and target prediction. finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (pnas) as a novel tool to inactivate potential srna and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == gram-positive pathogens are a major cause of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections, and exhibit a remarkable ability to develop antibiotic resistance. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) and multidrug-resistant pneumococci are  currently the major resistance challenges among gram-positives, due to their global dissemination and overall clinical impact. the mechanisms of evolution of  these resistance phenotypes are based on a diverse array of mutational events and gene transfer phenomena carried out by several types of mobile genetic elements,  followed by the dissemination of successful resistant clones. resistance to glycopeptides in staphylococci remains uncommon, likely due to fitness issues. resistance to the new anti-gram-positive agents (linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline) overall remains very rare. however, a transferable resistance mechanism to linezolid, mediated by ribosomal target modification by the cfr protein, has recently emerged among s. aureus, being a matter of raising concern. linezolid resistance among enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci is also increasingly reported. moreover, a role for antibiotic resistance has been advocated in the recent increase of clostridium difficile infection (cdi) associated with the emergence of hypervirulent strains.

TI  == infections caused by gram-positive bacteria: a review of the global challenge.
AB  == infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major public health burden, not just in terms of morbidity and mortality, but also in terms of increased expenditure on patient management and implementation of infection control measures. staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. are established pathogens in the hospital environment, and their frequent multidrug resistance complicates therapy. the archetypal hospital "superbug", methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), regularly attracts mass-media interest and, in many countries, there is political pressure to reduce mrsa infection rates, with some progress now being made in the united kingdom and the united states. to compound these established problems, we have witnessed the emergence and spread of virulent clones of mrsa in the community, and of clostridium difficile in hospitals. multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae clones are major community pathogens in many parts of the world, but are now being challenged by new conjugate vaccines. using combinations of molecular epidemiological tools, which characterize the resistant isolates and their resistance determinants, scientists can track highly successful bacterial strains at local, national, and international levels. these methods have provided new insights into the evolution of key pathogens, and this information may aid the design of control strategies and vaccines. in addition, the development of new antimicrobials including oxazolidinones, lipopeptides, glycylcyclines, ketolides, and new generations of fluoroquinolones, antistaphylococcal b-lactams, and glycopeptides must remain a high priority for the continued effective treatment of infections caused by resistant strains. so far, resistance to these newer agents is identified rarely in surveillance programs, but occasional reports of resistance causing therapeutic failure (e.g., with linezolid, daptomycin, telithromycin, or newer fluoroquinolones) give cause for concern. the emergence of antibiotic resistance is inevitable, but we must seek to decrease its impact and prolong the effectiveness of the agents available to us.

TI  == swine flu and antibiotics.
AB  == health services worldwide are likely to be hard-pressed by swine flu-related illness in the months ahead. secondary infections with streptococcus pneumoniae,  other streptococci (e.g. streptococcus pyogenes), haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus are likely to be important causes of morbidity and mortality. the uk department of health recently published clinical pathways for the management of swine flu. suggested severity criteria have not been validated  in respiratory infection and are different from those previously published. antibiotics are recommended for all patients assessed at hospital, regardless of  severity of illness; cephalosporins or quinolones are suggested for inpatients with pneumonia. these recommendations will jeopardize recent decreases in clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (cdad) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in uk hospitals. this article, written on behalf of the bsac council, considers these recommendations and provides alternative antibiotic regimens for a range of clinical scenarios.

TI  == human alpha-defensins inhibit hemolysis mediated by cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria release exotoxins that belong to the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. here, we report that human alpha-defensins hnp-1 to hnp-3 acted in a concentration-dependent manner to protect human red blood cells from the lytic effects of three of these exotoxins: anthrolysin o (alo), listeriolysin o, and pneumolysin. hd-5 was very effective against listeriolysin o but less effective against the other toxins. human alpha-defensins hnp-4 and hd-6 and human beta-defensin-1, -2, and -3 lacked protective ability. hnp-1 required intact disulfide bonds to prevent toxin-mediated hemolysis. a fully linearized analog, in which all six cysteines were replaced by aminobutyric acid (abu) residues, showed greatly reduced binding and protection. a partially unfolded hnp-1 analog, in which only cysteines 9 and  29 were replaced by abu residues, showed intact alo binding but was 10-fold less  potent in preventing hemolysis. surface plasmon resonance assays revealed that hnp-1 to hnp-3 bound all three toxins at multiple sites and also that solution-phase hnp molecules could bind immobilized hnp molecules. defensin concentrations that inhibited hemolysis by alo and listeriolysin did not prevent  these toxins from binding either to red blood cells or to cholesterol. others have shown that hnp-1 to hnp-3 inhibit lethal toxin of bacillus anthracis, toxin  b of clostridium difficile, diphtheria toxin, and exotoxin a of pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, this is the first time these defensins have been shown to inhibit pore-forming toxins. an "abcde mechanism" that can account for the ability of hnp-1 to hnp-3 to inhibit so many different exotoxins is proposed.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide cect7121 against human gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  == background: resistant gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. this work investigated the efficacy of ap-cect7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of enterococcus faecalis cect7121) against various pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. methods: strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard  antibiotic treatments. inhibitory activity of ap-cect7121 was assessed using the  agar-well diffusion method. the most resistant isolates from each species screened (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. results: these bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus and c. perfringens: viable counts for c. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. conclusions: ap-cect7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == spectrum of activity and mode of action of rep3123, a new antibiotic to treat clostridium difficile infections.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and  non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1  mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode  of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.

TI  == probiotics for children with diarrhea: an update.
AB  == this review focuses on the efficacy of probiotics for diarrhea in children in different settings: day-care centers, diarrhea acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 5 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus), and lactobacillus reuteri. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest: statistically significant for some strains only and in any case of minimal to mild clinical importance. few trials have examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spread of diarrhea in hospitalized children, an event most commonly due to either rotavirus or clostridium difficile, and they have yielded conflicting results. overall, these studies provide only weak evidence on the efficacy of probiotics. on the other hand, a large number of trials on the role of probiotics in preventing the  onset of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been published. most commonly employed probiotics were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium spp., streptococcus spp., and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. today, we have a large number of published clinical trials on the role of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea in children, and many of them are randomized, blinded, and controlled. they consistently show  a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii, but also l. reuteri-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, primarily rotaviral, in infants and young children of developed countries. such a beneficial effect seems to result in a reduction of diarrhea duration of little more than 1 day, and to be exerted mostly on diarrhea due to rotavirus. the effect is not only strain-dependent, but also dose-dependent, with doses of at least 10 billion/d being necessary.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == genome sequence of fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum - a genetically tractable fusobacterium.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a prominent member of the oral microbiota and is a common cause of human infection. f. nucleatum includes five subspecies: polymorphum, nucleatum, vincentii, fusiforme, and animalis. f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum atcc 10953 has been well characterized phenotypically and, in contrast to previously sequenced strains, is amenable to gene transfer. we sequenced and annotated the 2,429,698 bp genome of f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum atcc 10953. plasmid pfn3 from the strain was also sequenced and analyzed. when compared to the other two available fusobacterial genomes (f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and f. nucleatum subsp. vincentii) 627 open reading frames unique to f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum atcc 10953 were identified. a large percentage of these mapped within one of 28 regions or islands containing five or more genes. seventeen percent of the clustered proteins that demonstrated similarity were most similar to proteins from the clostridia, with others being most similar to proteins from other gram-positive organisms such as bacillus and  streptococcus. a ten kilobase region homologous to the salmonella typhimurium propanediol utilization locus was identified, as was a prophage and integrated conjugal plasmid. the genome contains five composite ribozyme/transposons, similar to the cdist istrons described in clostridium difficile. istrons are not  present in the other fusobacterial genomes. these findings indicate that f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum is proficient at horizontal gene transfer and that exchange with the firmicutes, particularly the clostridia, is common.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of hindgut bacteria associated with the development of equine laminitis.
AB  == carbohydrate-induced laminitis in horses is characterized by marked changes in the composition of the hindgut microbiota, from a predominantly gram-negative population to one dominated by gram-positive bacteria. the objective of this study was to monitor changes in the relative abundance of selected hindgut bacteria that have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of equine laminitis using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). caecal cannulae were surgically implanted in five standardbred horses and laminitis induced by oral administration of a bolus dose of oligofructose. caecal fluid and faecal specimens were collected over a 48 h period at 2 to 4 h intervals post-oligofructose administration and subjected to fish using probes specific for nine bacterial groups to determine changes in their relative abundance compared with total bacteria hybridizing to the generic eubmix probe. additionally, hoof biopsies were taken over the course of the experiment at 6 h intervals and evaluated for histopathological changes consistent with laminitis, allowing changes in hindgut microbiota to be correlated with the onset of lesions in the foot. of the microorganisms specifically targeted, streptococci of the streptococcus bovis/equinus complex were the only bacteria that consistently proliferated in both caecal fluid and faeces immediately before the onset of histological signs of laminitis. furthermore, lactobacilli, enterobacteriaceae, allisonella histaminiformans, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, mitsuokella jalaludinii and clostridium difficile did not establish significant populations in the hindgut before the onset of equine laminitis.

TI  == use of probiotic lactobacillus preparation to prevent diarrhoea associated with antibiotics: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to determine the efficacy of a probiotic drink containing lactobacillus for the prevention of any diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use  and that caused by clostridium difficile. design: randomised double blind placebo controlled study. participants: 135 hospital patients (mean age 74) taking antibiotics. exclusions included diarrhoea on admission, bowel pathology that could result in diarrhoea, antibiotic use in the previous four weeks, severe illness, immunosuppression, bowel surgery, artificial heart valves, and history of rheumatic heart disease or infective endocarditis. intervention: consumption of a 100 g (97 ml) drink containing lactobacillus casei, l bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus twice a day during a course of antibiotics and for one week after the course finished. the placebo group received a longlife sterile milkshake. main outcome measures: primary outcome: occurrence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea. secondary outcome: presence of c difficile toxin and diarrhoea. results: 7/57 (12%) of the probiotic group developed diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use compared with 19/56 (34%) in the placebo group (p=0.007). logistic regression to control for other factors gave an odds ratio 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.85) for use of the probiotic, with low albumin and sodium also increasing the risk of diarrhoea. the absolute risk reduction was 21.6% (6.6% to 36.6%), and the number needed to treat was 5 (3 to 15). no one in the probiotic group and 9/53 (17%) in the placebo group had diarrhoea caused by c difficile (p=0.001). the absolute risk reduction was 17% (7% to 27%), and the number needed to treat was 6 (4 to 14). conclusion: consumption of a probiotic drink containing l casei, l bulgaricus, and s thermophilus can reduce the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and c difficile associated diarrhoea. this has the potential to decrease morbidity, healthcare costs, and mortality if used routinely in patients aged over 50. trial registration: national research register n0016106821.

TI  == rac1, rhoa, and cdc42 participate in hela cell invasion by group b streptococcus.
AB  == the group b streptococcus (gbs) is an important human pathogen with the ability to cause invasive disease. to do so, the bacteria must invade host cells. it has  been well documented that gbs are able to invade a variety of nonphagocytic host  cell types, and this process is thought to involve a number of pathogen-host cell interactions. while some of the molecular aspects of the gbs-host cell invasion process have been characterized, many events still remain unclear. the objective  of this investigation was to evaluate the role of the rho-family gtpases rac, rho, and cdc42 in gbs invasion into epithelial cells. the epithelial cell invasion process was modeled using hela 229 cell culture. treatment of hela cells with 10 microm compactin, a pan-gtpase inhibitor, abolished gbs internalization,  suggesting that gtpases are involved in the gbs invasion process. the addition of toxin b or exoenzyme c3 to hela cells before gbs infection reduced invasion by 50%, further suggesting that the rho-family gtpases are involved in gbs entry. examining invasion of gbs into hela cells with altered genetic backgrounds was used to confirm these findings; gbs invasion into hela cells transiently transfected with dominant negative rac1, cdc42, or rhoa reduced invasion by 75%,  51%, and 42%, respectively. results of this study suggest that the rho-family gtpases are required for efficient invasion of hela cells by gbs.

TI  == [treatment of community acquired pneumonia].
AB  == the s3 guidelines for diagnosis and therapy use german epidemiological data to set the standards for a risk and degree of severity based treatment of community  acquired pneumonia (cap). over the last few years, a change in pathogen epidemiology has been recognized with the significance of staphylococci and enterobacteria increasing. cap is becoming increasingly a disease of the elderly, for whom a more broadly effective initial therapy appears to be needed. resistant pathogens play an important role in the course of the disease. for patients with  a low risk of mortality, a reduction in the length of therapy seems possible. on  the other hand, the early identification of critically ill patients who require treatment with high dose, broad spectrum antibiotics is necessary. antibiotic associated diarrhoea, caused by clostridium difficile, is a significant complication in antibiotic therapy. with the introduction of vaccination against  streptococcus pneumoniae for children, a change in the course of the illness and  an improvement in the resistance situation has been achieved. an update of the s3 guidelines is intended for 2008 in order to integrate new knowledge into the recommendations.

AB  == the complete genomic sequence of a previously characterized temperate phage of clostridium difficile, c2, is reported. the genome is 56 538 bp and organized into 84 putative orfs in six functional modules. the head and tail structural proteins showed similarities to that of c. difficile phage cd119 and streptococcus pneumoniae phage ej-1, respectively. homologues of structural and replication proteins were found in prophages 1 and 2 of the sequenced c. difficile cd630 genome. a putative holin appears unique to the c. difficile phages and was functional when expressed in escherichia coli. nucleotide sequence comparisons of c2 to cd119 and the cd630 prophage sequences showed relatedness between c2 and the prophages, but less so to cd119. c2 integrated into a gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulator of the gntr family. c2, cd119 and cd630 prophage 1 genomes had a cdu1-attp-integrase arrangement, suggesting that the pathogenicity locus (paloc) of c. difficile, flanked by cdu1, has phage origins. the attp sequences of c2, cd119 and cd630 prophages were dissimilar. c2-related sequences were found in 84 % of 37 clinical c. difficile isolates and  typed reference strains.

TI  == how long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? a systematic review.
AB  == background: inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. methods: the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions. in addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard  textbooks on the topic were reviewed. all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were  included. results: most gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. (including vre), staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), or streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. many gram-negative species, such as acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or shigella spp., can also survive for months. a few others, such as bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, proteus vulgaris, or vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. mycobacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. persistence of other yeasts, such as torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (candida parapsilosis, 14 days). most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, sars or rhino virus, can persist on  surfaces for a few days. viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, hav, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. blood-borne viruses, such as hbv or hiv, can persist for more than one week. herpes viruses, such as cmv or hsv type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from  only a few hours up to 7 days. conclusion: the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.

TI  == increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  == in a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10%  fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. in the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, streptococcus group b, clostridium difficile, bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter). conclusion: the data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium perfringens by a novel strain of bacillus subtilis isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to isolate beneficial strains of microorganisms from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens and to screen them against clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of necrotic enteritis in poultry. one  of the bacteria isolated, a strain of bacillus subtilis, was found to possess an  anticlostridial factor that could inhibit the c. perfringens atcc 13124 used in this study. the anticlostridial factor produced by b. subtilis pb6 was found to be fully or partially inactivated in the presence of pronase, trypsin, and pepsin. in contrast, the antimicrobial activity of the anticlostridial factor was not affected by treatment at 100 or 121 degrees c or by treatment with any of the organic solvents used in the study. the optimum growth temperature and optimum ph for production of the anticlostridial factor were 37 degrees c and 6.20, respectively. using the mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy technique, the apparent molecular mass of the anticlostridial factor was estimated to be in the  range from 960 to 983 da. in terms of the antimicrobial spectrum, the anticlostridial factor was inhibitory toward various strains of c. perfringens implicated in necrotic enteritis in poultry, clostridium difficile, streptococcus pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, and campylobacter coli.

TI  == structural characterization of the cell wall binding domains of clostridium difficile toxins a and b; evidence that ca2+ plays a role in toxin a cell surface association.
AB  == clostridium difficile (c.difficile) is a nosocomially acquired intestinal bacillus which can cause chronic diarrhea and life-threatening colitis. the pathogenic effects of the bacillus are mediated by the release of two toxins, a and b. the c-terminal portions of both toxins are composed of 20 and 30 residue repeats known as cell wall binding (cwb) domains. we have cloned and expressed the cwb-domains of toxins a and b and several truncated cwb-domain constructs to  investigate their structure and function. the smallest cwb-domain that folded in  a cooperative manner was an 11 repeat construct of toxin a. this differentiates the c-terminal domains of toxins a and b from the cwb-domain of streptococcus pneumoniae lyta, which only requires six repeats to fold. the 11 repeat toxin a construct bound ca2+ directly with millimolar affinity and interacted with mammalian cell surfaces in a concentration and ca2+-dependent fashion. millimolar ca2+ levels also accelerated toxin mediated cho cell killing in an in vitro cell  assay. together, the data suggest a role for extracellular ca2+ in the sensitization of toxin a/cell-surface interactions.

TI  == probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
AB  == purpose of review: the author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. recent findings: normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. combinations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas escherichia coli nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. use of probiotics in crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. probiotics have multiple  mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). although multiple probiotic  species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. summary: probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic  conditions.

AB  == candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-gc gram-positive bacteria, thermotogales and bacteroidetes/chlorobi. this allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. in particular, orthologs of ygea of escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. three new families of histidine transporters  were predicted, orthologs of yuif and yvsh of bacillus subtilis, and lysq of lactococcus lactis. in pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thra was predicted to be regulated not only  by threonine and isoleucine, as in e. coli, but also by methionine. in alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvih was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in bacillus cereus and clostridium difficile, and by histidine t-boxes in l. lactis and streptococcus mutans.

TI  == alpha c protein of group b streptococcus binds host cell surface glycosaminoglycan and enters cells by an actin-dependent mechanism.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) colonizes mucosal surfaces of the human gastrointestinal and gynecological tracts and causes disease in a wide range of patients. invasive illness occurs after organisms traverse an epithelial boundary and enter deeper tissues. previously we have reported that the alpha c protein (acp) on the surface of gbs mediates gbs entry into me180 cervical epithelial cells and gbs translocation across layers of these cells. we now demonstrate that acp interacts with host cell glycosaminoglycan (gag); the interaction of acp with me180 cells is inhibited if cells are pretreated with sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of sulfate incorporation, or with heparitinases. the interaction is also inhibited in the presence of soluble heparin or heparan sulfate or host cell-derived gag. in addition, acp binds soluble heparin specifically in inhibition and dot blot assays. after interaction with host gag, soluble acp enters me180 cells and fractionates to the eukaryotic cell cytosol. these events  are inhibited in cells pretreated with cytochalasin d or with clostridium difficile toxin b. these data indicate that full-length acp interacts with me180  cell gag and enters the eukaryotic cell cytosol by a mechanism that involves rho  gtpase-dependent actin rearrangements. we suggest that these molecular interactions drive acp-mediated translocation of gbs across epithelial barriers,  thereby facilitating invasive gbs infection.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == [present state and disadvantage of rapid diagnosis method in clinical microbiology--analysis of questionnaire survey].
AB  == to investigate the present state and the disadvantages of rapid diagnosis methods in clinical microbiology in japan, we have conducted a questionnaire survey of 360 medical facilities accredited by the japanese association for rapid method and automation in microbiology (jarmam). major rapid diagnosis methods being used in clinical microbiology are, in the order of its use rate, influenza virus, adenovirus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, clostridium difficile toxin a, rotavirus, hepatitis b virus, group a streptococcus, rs virus, hepatitis c virus antibody. the fact found by this survey is that there is some gap between two groups, as one group views that the result of rapid diagnosis method can be considered as the final, another views that it is a supplementary diagnosis under conventional  methods such as culturing. some problems related to rapid diagnosis methods are also pointed out; how to interpret and report a test result obtained by the rapid diagnosis method when it is different from that of culture method, it can not perform antibiotic sensitivity tests, a problem of non-specific reaction, comparatively higher cost of rapid diagnosis kits. this survey finds that rapid diagnosis methods have greatly contributed to early medical treatment and appropriate therapy with its quickness, such as the use of rapid diagnosis kits for bacterial meningitis or viral infectious diseases requiring clinical urgency  is highly necessitated even though some problems mentioned above exist.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from 32 healthy korean infants was measured. the ability  to show similar activity against escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. twelve of the 109 lab showed activity against c. difficile and 19 strains were active against e. coli o157:h7, but none against s. aureus. four strains had antimicrobial activity against both c. difficile and e.  coli o157:h7. of the 12 strains that had activity against c. difficile, four strains were excluded as streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species. based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus salivarius.

TI  == limited value of routine microbiological diagnostics in patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == current guidelines recommend microbiological diagnostic procedures as a part of the management of patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (cap), but the value of such efforts has been questioned. patients hospitalized for cap  were studied retrospectively, focusing on the use of aetiological diagnostic methods and their clinical impact. adult patients, without known human immunodeficiency virus infection, admitted to hospital for cap during 12 months,  were evaluated with regard to the importance of aetiological diagnosis for tailoring antibiotic therapy, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, clostridium difficile disease, length of hospital stay and mortality. of the 605 studied patients, 482 (80%) were subjected to mycoplasma pneumoniae and/or respiratory virus serology and/or cultures of blood and/or sputum. they had a better prognosis than patients not subjected to microbiological diagnostics (mortality within 3 months was 9% vs 24%, p = 0.001), apparently reflecting differences in general health (e.g. less dementia diagnosis) but not the outcome of diagnostics. a presumptive aetiology was obtained only in 132 of the 482 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae and m. pneumoniae being the most common agents (in 49 and 36 patients, respectively). establishing an aetiological diagnosis had no impact on the number of in-hospital changes of therapy, on the proportion of new  regimens having a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than the initial one or on the  outcome. therapy was changed to a drug directed specifically against the identified pathogen in only 16 out of these 132 patients and again without any overall improvement in the outcome variables. in a setting with a low frequency of antibiotic-resistant respiratory tract pathogens current routine microbiological diagnostics were found to be of limited value for the clinical management of patients hospitalized for cap. improved diagnostics in cap are urgently needed, as establishing an aetiological diagnosis carries a potential for optimizing the antibiotic therapy.

TI  == the icest1 element of streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  == the 34,734-bp element icest1 from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. icest1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. six proteins of the putative conjugative system of icest1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon tn916 from enterococcus faecalis. a comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low g+c bacteria including bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, e. faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative  elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. these exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. we propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and  integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "integrative and conjugative elements" (ices), irrespective of the  integration specificity.

AB  == this paper reports a case of haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of h. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s ribosomal rna gene  sequencing. in the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with streptococcus intermedius and s. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. in the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress c in air with co2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. both strains were factor v-dependent, but not factor x-dependent. for the first isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 56% likely to be actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% neisseria subflava; whereas the api  system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. for the second isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 95% likely to be h. influenzae viii; whereas the api system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and h. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and h. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of h. segnis. only two cases of h. segnis bacteraemia were found in the english scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. including the present two cases, the overall mortality of h. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.

TI  == double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the effect of azithromycin with  clarithromycin on oropharyngeal and bowel microflora in volunteers.
AB  == the purpose of this double-blind study was to assess the effect of azithromycin and clarithromycin on oral and fecal microflora. bacterial species from fecal samples and throat washes from healthy volunteers were identified and quantified  before, during and after receipt of either placebo ( n=6), azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 3 days; n=6) or clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily for 7 days; n=6). in both antibiotic groups, the changes in oropharyngeal aerobic microflora  following antibiotic administration were minor. antibiotics neither changed the bacterial load of streptococcus spp. compared with placebo, nor did macrolide-resistant streptococci emerge. in the fecal aerobic microflora, the number of organisms of the family enterobacteriaceae decreased slightly after antibiotic administration in both the clarithromycin and the azithromycin groups, but levels normalized by day 21 after therapy. no colonization with nonfermenters or clostridium difficile was seen, and the total number of anaerobic bacteria was not affected in any study group. in conclusion, there were no significant differences between azithromycin and clarithromycin in their effect on human oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora, nor was the use of these antibiotics associated with colonization by resistant, gram-positive organisms or overgrowth  of opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == the use of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease.
AB  == probiotics are living microorganisms that can affect the host in a beneficial manner. prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth and activity of probiotic bacteria already established in the colon. efficacy of  probiotic compounds has been shown in a wide range of gastrointestinal diseases.  lactobacillus gg alone, or the combination of bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus, is effective in the treatment of clostridium difficile, as well as in preventing the frequency and severity of infectious acute diarrhea in children. prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea with the concomitant administration of either lactobacillus gg or saccharomyces boulardii  has been demonstrated. the most successful studies involve the use of lactobacillus gg at a dose of 1 x 1010 viable organisms per day and the yeast boulardii at a dose of 1 g/day. a probiotic preparation (vsl#3 - 6 g/day) that uses a combination of three species of bifidobacterium, four strains of lactobacillus and one strain of streptocccus has shown promise in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis, as well as in preventing the postoperative recurrence of crohn's disease. the mechanism of action of probiotics may include receptor competition, effects on mucin secretion or probiotic immunomodulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. oral administration of probiotic compounds has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and safe. however, while probiotics have the potential to improve human health and to prevent and treat some diseases, major improvements are needed in labelling and quality assurance procedures for probiotic compounds. in addition, well planned and controlled clinical studies are necessary to delineate fully the potential for probiotic compounds.

TI  == human infections caused by glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus spp: are they a zoonosis?
AB  == following the detection of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) in 1986 and their subsequent global dissemination during the 1990s, many studies have attempted to identify the reservoirs and lines of resistance transmission as a basis for intervention. the eradication of reservoirs and the prevention of gre spread is of major importance for two reasons: (i) the emergence of high-level glycopeptide resistance in invasive enterococcal clinical isolates that are already multiresistant, has left clinicians with therapeutic options that are only at the experimental stage; and (ii) the resistance genes may spread to more  virulent bacterial species such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium difficile. vana-type strains, resistant to high levels of both vancomycin and teicoplanin, are the most commonly encountered enterococci with acquired glycopeptide resistance in humans. a widespread vana-type gre reservoir was detected early in farm animals that were exposed to the glycopeptide growth-promoter avoparcin. numerous studies have provided indirect evidence for the transfer of vana-type gre and their resistance determinants from animal reservoirs to humans. the data collected have expanded our understanding of the promiscuous nature of antibiotic resistance, and have provided the groundwork for logical decision-making with the objective of deterring the dissemination of resistant bacteria and of their resistance genes.

AB  == cefmatilen hydrochloride hydrate (s-1090) was orally administered to rats at dose levels of 100, 300 and 1000 mg potency/kg once daily for 6 months. all the s-1090 treated groups showed soft feces, reddish-brown feces (due to chelated products of s-1090 or its decomposition products with fe3+ in the diet), abdominal distention, increased food and water consumption, lower urine ph, and a decrease  of white blood cells counts (except for males of the 100 mg potency/kg group). one male in the 300 mg potency/kg group showed mucous feces and marked decrease in body weight, and diet in the middle stage of the administration period. in necropsy of the survivors of all treated groups, marked cecal enlargement was noted. no remarkable changes were observed in the other examination items. from the early stage of the withdrawal period, animals in the 1000 mg potency/kg group showed again soft or mucous feces and a marked decrease in body weight. of these  animals, one male died and another male was sacrificed in a moribund state at about 2 weeks of the withdrawal period. enterocolitis was observed in these cases. almost all animals recovered within 3 weeks of withdrawal. a supplemental  study of the 6-month toxicity study was conducted to examine the mechanisms of enterocolitis and the changes observable in the 100 or 300 mg potency/kg groups after drug withdrawal. as a reference, cefdinir (cfdn), an oral cephem antibiotic the same as s-1090, was added in the 1000 mg potency/kg group. no deaths occurred in any groups. decreased intestinal flora were noted in all the groups treated with s-1090 or cfdn at the end of the dosing period. at 2 weeks of the withdrawal period, c. difficile and its d-1 toxin in the cecal contents were highly detected in the s-1090 300 and 1000 mg potency/kg groups and cfdn group. inflammatory changes in the cecum and colon were observed in these groups. at 4 weeks of the withdrawal period, intestinal flora in the s-1090 groups almost returned to the condition before dosing, but those in the cfdn group were retained highly. cecal  d-1 toxin in the cfdn group was positive and higher than in the s-1090 groups. it was thus considered that the critical condition with enterocolitis resulted from  c. difficile, which proliferated more rapidly than the other bacteria and d-1 toxin produced by this bacteria in the withdrawal period. above changes were commonly observed in the cfdn group. the noael of s-1090 was assessed to be 100 mg potency/kg/day which induced no enteritis.

AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

AB  == background and aims: the gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. the aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria,  a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. methods: antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of gram negative and gram positive pathogens. inhibition of salmonella typhimurium sl1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using caco-2  cells. colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic c3/he/oujco mice. antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo  in axenic c3/he/oujco mice infected by the lethal s typhimurium c5 strain. results: fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were  examined for antimicrobial activity. two strains (ca1 and f9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular s typhimurium sl1344 in caco-2 cells. an antibacterial component(s) produced by ca1 and f9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. in the axenic c3/he/oujco mice, ca1 and f9  strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against s typhimurium c5 lethal infection. conclusion: several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.

TI  == clostridium difficile recombinant toxin a repeating units as a carrier protein for conjugate vaccines: studies of pneumococcal type 14, escherichia coli k1, and shigella flexneri type 2a polysaccharides in mice.
AB  == unlike the native protein, a nontoxic peptide (repeating unit of the native toxin designated raru) from clostridium difficile toxin a (cdta) afforded an antigen that could be bound covalently to the surface polysaccharides of pneumococcus type 14, shigella flexneri type 2a, and escherichia coli k1. the yields of these  polysaccharide-protein conjugates were significantly increased by prior treatment of raru with succinic anhydride. conjugates, prepared with raru or succinylated (rarusucc), were administered to mice by a clinically relevant dosage and immunization scheme. all conjugates elicited high levels of serum immunoglobulin  g both to the polysaccharides and to cdta. conjugate-induced anti-cdta had neutralizing activity in vitro and protected mice challenged with cdta, similar to the raru alone. conjugates prepared with succinylated raru, therefore, have potential for serving both as effective carrier proteins for polysaccharides and  for preventing enteric disease caused by c. difficile.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == transfer of a conjugative transposon, tn5397 in a model oral biofilm.
AB  == a tetracycline resistance profile was established from a microcosm dental plaque  in a constant depth film fermenter. the fermenter was inoculated with a bacillus  subtilis strain which contained the conjugative transposon, tn5397, which confers tetracycline resistance upon its host. after 6 hour and 24 hour the tetracycline  resistance profile of the biofilm was redetermined and a tetracycline resistant streptococcus species was isolated. a molecular analysis of this strain confirmed that tn5397 was present in the genomic dna of the isolate. these data represent the first report, to our knowledge, of intergeneric transfer of a conjugative transposon in a mixed species biofilm and demonstrates the ability of conjugative transposons to disseminate antibiotic resistance genes in a mixed species environment.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of t-3811me, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of t-3811me, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. t-3811, a free base of t-3811me, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. in particular, t-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. t-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). t-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with gyra and parc (grla) mutations. the  activity of t-3811 against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. in common with other fluoroquinolones, t-3811 was highly active against haemophilus  influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and legionella sp., with mic90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. t-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. t-3811 was the most active agent against c. trachomatis (mic, 0.008 microgram/ml) and m. pneumoniae (mic90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). the activity of t-3811 against m. tuberculosis (mic90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. in experimental systemic infection with a grla mutant of s. aureus and experimental  pneumonia with prsp in mice, t-3811me showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.

AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus lf221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: bacillus cereus, clostridium sp., listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus d. l. acidophilus lf221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin lf221 a and acidocin lf221 b, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase fplc. the  antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase k) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide a and 35 of peptide b were determined. among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. no significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin lf221 a and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology  was found between acidocin lf221 b and brevicin 27. l. acidophilus lf221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.

TI  == [genotyping of isolates of bacteria and candida].
AB  == strain differentiation of staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. rea of 19 methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. fifty-three isolates of s. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of rea pattern. rea patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those  from different staphylococcus species. a total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 s. pneumoniae isolates. there was some correlation between the rea patterns and serotypes. in addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. sixteen isolates of e. coli o157 and 18 isolates of e. coli o25 were analyzed by rea with haeiii. among 14 epidemiologically unrelated e. coli o157:h7 isolates, rea patterns were either identical or differed only by  a few fragment bands. rea patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing e. coli o25 from an outbreak were identical. eight distinct rea patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic c. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. candida strains belonging to different six candida species were analysed by rea. all c. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains  were divided into 37 groups according to the rea patterns. each candida strain showed species-specific rea patterns. twenty-one isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by pcr with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of is6110(is6110-pcr). the results of pcr of 19 m. tuberculosis isolates and 2 m. bovis bcg isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. our results demonstrated that rea of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii was a useful tool for strain differentiation. by comparing the species-specific rea patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of candida  and staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. because is6110-pcr is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate m. tuberculosis strains.

TI  == the intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  == bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. in infants delivered by caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. the first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which  remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. among them, staphylococcus,  enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from  the newborn faecal flora at birth. facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by bifidobacterium sp. clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a caesarean section. clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp. the impact of caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. in humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. formula feeding seems  to promote implantation and persistence of clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of c. difficile in newborns.

TI  == genetic characterisation of the botulinum toxin complex of clostridium botulinum  strain nctc 2916.
AB  == an 8 kb segment of the clostridium botulinum nctc 2916 genome 5' to the type a botulinum neurotoxin gene has been sequenced revealing five open reading frames.  four encode components (ha70, ha17, ha34 and ntnh/a) of the progenitor toxin complex. the product of the fifth, orfx, possesses a putative c-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, exhibits homology with known regulatory proteins (including msmr from streptococcus mutans, uvia from c. perfringens and orftxe1 located upstream of the c. difficile toxin b gene) and is also found within the vicinity of genes encoding tetanus toxin and types b, c, d and g botulinum toxins. primer extension and northern blotting analysis demonstrates that the genes are expressed as two divergent operons [ha34, ha17, ha70] and [ntnh/a, type a toxin gene], with the orfx gene expressed singly. immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start sites of the ha34 and ntnh/a genes are two highly conserved motifs (5'-attttaggtttacaaaa-3' and 5'-atgttatatgtaa-3'), separated by 12 bp, that span the putative -35 and -10 promoter regions. homologous sequences occur in the equivalent position relative to the genes at type c botulinum toxin gene and the tetanus toxin gene loci. it is likely that these sequence motifs, together with orfx, are involved in the co-ordinate expression of the genes encoding the various components of the botulinum toxin complex in groups i, iii and iv c. botulinum strains and in that of the tetanus toxin gene.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

TI  == tracking the evolution of the bacterial choline-binding domain: molecular characterization of the clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052 cspa gene.
AB  == the major secreted protein of clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052, a choline-containing strain, is cspa (clostridial secreted protein). it appears to  be a 115,000-m(r) glycoprotein that specifically recognizes the choline residues  of the cell wall. polyclonal antibodies raised against cspa detected the presence of the protein in the cell envelope and in the culture medium. the soluble cspa protein has been purified, and an oligonucleotide probe, prepared from the determined n-terminal sequence, has been used to clone the cspa gene which encodes a protein with 590 amino acids and an m(r) of 63,740. according to the predicted amino acid sequence, cspa is synthesized with an n-terminal segment of  26 amino acids characteristic of prokaryotic signal peptides. expression of the cspa gene in escherichia coli led to the production of a major anti-cspa-labeled  protein of 80,000 da which was purified by affinity chromatography on deae-cellulose. a comparison of cspa with other proteins in the embl database revealed that the c-terminal half of cspa is homologous to the choline-binding domains of the major pneumococcal autolysin (lyta amidase), the pneumococcal antigen pspa, and other cell wall-lytic enzymes of pneumococcal phages. this region, which is constructed of four repeating motifs, also displays a high similarity with the glucan-binding domains of several streptococcal glycosyltransferases and the toxins of clostridium difficile.

TI  == definition of a fundamental repeating unit in streptococcal glucosyltransferase glucan-binding regions and related sequences.
AB  == the c-termini of the glucosyltransferases (gtfs) of oral streptococci are responsible for glucan binding. these glucan-binding domains (gbds) are composed  of a series of repeated sequences that have been classified into four different classes (a-d) by virtue of sequence similarity and which, by inference, have been suggested to be of functional importance. in contrast, we propose that repeat sequences evolve in response to selection for an increase in the number of copies of a particular domain through multiple duplication events occurring at different times. according to this hypothesis, repeats should possess various degrees of similarity, especially if only key residues are of functional importance. analysis of the gbds of the gtfs indicated that a common fundamental repeat, designated the "yg" repeat, could be discerned within the "a", "b", "c", and "d"  repeats. similar elements were also conserved in the ligand-binding repeats of the clostridium difficile toxins and the lysins and the pspa protein of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that similar selective pressures had also been imposed on these sequences. analysis of the "yg" repeats present in the gtfj and gtfk of streptococcus salivarius indicated that some of the "yg" repeats in the gbds of these proteins had arisen as a result of duplication events involving a series of three sequential "yg" repeats.

AB  == analysis of the sequence for the gene encoding pspa (pneumococcal surface protein a) of streptococcus pneumoniae revealed the presence of four distinct domains in  the mature protein. the structure of the n-terminal half of pspa was highly consistent with that of an alpha-helical coiled-coil protein. the alpha-helical domain was followed by a proline-rich domain (with two regions in which 18 of 43  and 5 of 11 of the residues are prolines) and a repeat domain consisting of 10 highly conserved 20-amino-acid repeats. a fourth domain consisting of a hydrophobic region too short to serve as a membrane anchor and a poorly charged region followed the repeats and preceded the translation stop codon. the c-terminal region of pspa did not possess features conserved among numerous other surface proteins, suggesting that pspa is attached to the cell by a mechanism unique among known surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria. the repeat domain  of pspa was found to have significant homology with c-terminal repeat regions of  proteins from streptococcus mutans, streptococcus downei, clostridium difficile,  and s. pneumoniae. comparisons of these regions with respect to functions and homologies suggested that, through evolution, the repeat regions may have lost or gained a mechanism for attachment to the bacterial cell.

TI  == tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole.
AB  == the tetracyclines are effective in the treatment of chlamydia, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and rickettsial infections and also can be used for gonococcal infections in patients unable to tolerate penicillin. these drugs may cause gastrointestinal irritation, diarrhea, phototoxic dermatitis, and vestibular damage, and fatal reactions due to hepatotoxicity have occurred in pregnant women. chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of bacteriostatic activity, but its association with suppression of the bone marrow and aplastic anemia has relegated it to a historical role. erythromycin is the drug of choice for the treatment of  infections caused by m. pneumoniae, legionella species, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the frequency of serious adverse effects associated with the use of erythromycin is low; dose-related epigastric distress may occur. clindamycin is bactericidal to most nonenterococcal gram-positive aerobic bacteria and many anaerobic microorganisms. although historically it was a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, clindamycin is considered an excellent alternative to beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of many staphylococcal infections, and it has therapeutic utility in anaerobic infections and in several protozoan infections in immunosuppressed patients. metronidazole is efficacious for treating nonpulmonary anaerobic infections, various parasitic infections (trichomoniasis,  amebiasis, and giardiasis), nonspecific vaginitis, and clostridium difficile-mediated colitis. with use of metronidazole, mild side effects such as  epigastric discomfort, diarrhea, reversible neutropenia, and allergic-type cutaneous reactions may occur.

TI  == comparison of oral cefpodoxime proxetil and penicillin v potassium in the treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis. the cefpodoxime pharyngitis study group.
AB  == ninety-three patients with a diagnosis of acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis due to streptococcus pyogenes were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of cefpodoxime proxetil orally with food every 12 hours or 250 mg of penicillin v potassium orally on an empty stomach every six hours. treatment efficacy was evaluated in 30 cefpodoxime-treated and 33 penicillin-treated patients. after 10 days of treatment, s pyogenes was eradicated from the throat culture in 29 of the 30 cefpodoxime-treated patients and in 30 of the 33 penicillin-treated patients. twenty days after treatment termination, infection recurred in one patient of each treatment group. clinical cure or improvement was found in 97% of the patients in each group. adverse medical events occurred in nine of the 48 cefpodoxime-treated patients and in four of the 45 penicillin-treated patients; these were probably related to the study drug in seven and two patients, respectively. the most common adverse events were nausea (in three cefpodoxime and one penicillin patient) and diarrhea (in three and two). no patient showed colitis related to clostridium difficile. no clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results were found in either treatment group. it is concluded that cefpodoxime proxetil is as effective and safe as penicillin v potassium in the treatment of pharyngitis due to s pyogenes.

TI  == antigenic cross-reactivity and functional inhibition by antibodies to clostridium difficile toxin a, streptococcus mutans glucan-binding protein, and a synthetic peptide.
AB  == a 10-amino-acid repeating sequence of the hemagglutinating portion of clostridium difficile toxin a has been synthesized and used to produce antisera in rabbits. antipeptide antibody inhibited toxin a-mediated hemagglutination and neutralized  cytotoxic activity. immunoblot analysis with the antipeptide antibody revealed cross-reactivity with native toxin, a recombinant protein containing the toxin a  repeats, and a glucan-binding protein from streptococcus mutans whose primary structure has repeating amino acid motifs similar to those of the synthetic peptide. a polyclonal antibody against the glucan-binding protein, which cross-reacted with purified toxin a, also inhibited toxin a-mediated hemagglutination and neutralized cytotoxic activity. we recently identified toxin a and the glucan-binding protein as members of a novel family of clostridial and  streptococcal binding proteins based on conserved repeating amino acid motifs at  the c-terminal region of the molecules. this study provides immunological and functional evidence of the predicted relationship between toxin a and the glucan-binding protein and further implicates the repeating subunits as ligand-binding domains in this family of proteins.

TI  == a family of clostridial and streptococcal ligand-binding proteins with conserved  c-terminal repeat sequences.
AB  == analysis of the derived amino acid sequences of toxins a and b from clostridium difficile has identified an extraordinarily large number of repeat amino acid units in the c-terminal regions of the proteins. nearly one third of each of the  proteins consist of repeating units which appear, at least in the case of toxin a, to be responsible for carbohydrate binding. similar repeat units are also found in the c-terminal region of four glucosyltransferases from streptococcus mutans and streptococcus downei, and in four lytic enzymes from streptococcus pneumoniae and its bacteriophages (hb-3, cp-1 and cp-9). in each case the repeats constitute the ligand-binding portion of the respective enzymes. a glucan-binding protein from s. mutans, which lacks enzymatic activity, has similar repeats spanning almost the entire molecule. this family of ligand-binding proteins appears to be of modular design, with one module consisting of a repetitive ligand-binding domain located in the c-terminal region and the other module(s) providing enzymatic functions.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial spectrum and activity of ceftibuten against clinical isolates from west germany.
AB  == the in vitro activity of a new oral cephalosporin, ceftibuten, was determined against 837 clinical isolates by agar dilution technique and compared with that of the oral cephalosporins, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, cefpodoxime, and cefprozil. against enterobacteriaceae, ceftibuten was the most active of the compounds. ceftibuten mic90s were less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml for most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, 0.13 microgram/ml for haemophilus  influenzae, 4 micrograms/ml for moraxella catarrhalis, and 0.5 microgram/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae. ceftibuten also was active against beta-haemolytic streptococci (serogroups a, c, and g) and penicillin-susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), but was not active against staphylococcus spp. or the anaerobic bacteria studied. cefpodoxime and cefuroxime were the most active of the cephalosporins against nonenteric streptococci; cefprozil and cefuroxime were the most active against staphylococci, and cefaclor demonstrated the greatest activity against some bacteroides spp. most strains of  acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas spp., and methicillin-resistant staphylococci, as well as all strains of clostridium difficile, were resistant to each of the cephalosporins tested.

TI  == clostridium difficile toxin a carries a c-terminal repetitive structure homologous to the carbohydrate binding region of streptococcal glycosyltransferases.
AB  == a detailed analysis of the 8130-bp open reading frame (orf) of gene toxa and of an upstream orf designated utxa, indicates the presence of a transcription terminator stem-loop for toxa, promoter sequences, and shine-dalgarno boxes for toxa and utxa. no transcription terminator between toxa and utxa is suggested by  the sequence. toxa contains two domains, one-third (c-terminal) with a repetitive structure and the residual two-thirds with no repetitions. the 2499-bp sequence encoding the repetitive structure is composed of nine groups of different short repetitive oligodeoxyribonucleotides (srons). a combination of these srons codes  for five groups of combined repetitive oligopeptides (crops). seven 50-amino acid (aa) crops and 23 crops of 21 aa in length are noticed. the crops are generally highly conserved, but four exhibit variability and possibly represent 'hot spots' of the repetitive structure. the reactivity of the c-terminal repeat with monoclonal antibody 1337c8 indicates that this part contains the carbohydrate-binding domain of toxa. in this region homology exists between the toxa repeats and the glucosyltransferases of streptococci. we propose that binding of toxa to cells occurs via the c-terminal repeat domain, with the n-terminal domain being responsible for toxic function.

TI  == in-vitro activity of vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, mdl 62873 and other agents against staphylococci, enterococci and clostridium difficile.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of different antibiotics were determined by a broth microdilution method for staphylococci, enterococci and clostridium difficile. the antimicrobial agents tested were vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, mdl 62873, rifampicin and piperacillin, the  latter limited to enterococci. in terms of mic90s, daptomycin (0.89 mg/l). mdl 62873 (0.99 mg/l), and teicoplanin (1.50 mg/l) were found to be highly active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). daptomycin (mic90 0.48 mg/l), mdl 62873 (0.95 mg/l) and ramoplanin (1.45 mg/l) were the most active drugs against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse). teicoplanin (mic90 0.45 mg/l) was the most active agent against enterococci, followed by mdl 62873 (0.65 mg/l) and daptomycin (1.60 mg/l). mdl 62873 gave the lowest mic90 (0.17 mg/l) for c. difficile. teicoplanin (mic90 0.42 mg/l), daptomycin (0.87 mg/l) and ramoplanin (0.98 mg/l) were also very active. our results indicate that teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin and mdl 62873, a teicoplanin derivative, are  potentially effective alternative antibiotics for treatment of infections caused  by staphylococci, enterococci and c. difficile.

TI  == effect of ceftazidime and gentamicin on the oropharyngeal and faecal flora of patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  == thirty-four patients with haematological malignancies were studied to investigate the effect of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (ceftazidime and gentamicin) on the gastro-intestinal flora. twenty-five patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or post-autologous bone-marrow transplantation were given framycetin, nystatin and colistin (fracon), and two patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma were on co-trimoxazole, as long-term gut prophylaxis. semi-quantitative  microbiology was carried out on oropharyngeal swabs and quantitative microbiology on faecal specimens. the oropharyngeal flora consisted mainly of streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci and coryneforms, and was little affected by ceftazidime/gentamicin. a strain of enterobacter cloacae resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin colonized one patient, who later developed septicaemia. the faecal flora of patients on fracon was dominated by enterococci; the few enterobacteria  present were eliminated by ceftazidime/gentamicin. the anaerobic flora was absent in 15% of patients; in the remainder, it consisted mainly of bacteroides spp., and was little affected by ceftazidime/gentamicin. the faecal flora of patients not on fracon always contained anaerobes, and some strains of enterobacteria persisted throughout antibiotic treatment. none of the patients was colonized by  clostridium difficile or pseudomonas aeruginosa. broad-spectrum therapy with ceftazidime and gentamicin appeared to have little effect on the gastro-intestinal flora, except to encourage the overgrowth of enterococci and reduce the numbers of enterobacteria.

TI  == hybridization analysis of three chloramphenicol resistance determinants from clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile.
AB  == the chloramphenicol resistance determinant from a nonconjugative strain of clostridium perfringens was cloned and shown to be expressed in escherichia coli. subcloning and deletion analysis localized the resistance gene, catq, to within a 1.25-kilobase (kb) partial sau3a fragment. the catq gene contained internal hindii, haeiii, and drai restriction sites and was distinct from the catp gene, which was originally cloned (l. j. abraham, a. j. wales, and j. i. rood plasmid 14:37-46, 1985) from the conjugative c. perfringens r plasmid, pip401. hybridization studies were carried out with a 0.35-kb drai-p fragment of pjir260  as an internal catq-specific probe and a 0.38-kb ecorv-hinfi fragment of pjir62 as an internal catp-specific gene probe. the results showed that the catp and catq genes were not similar and that neither probe hybridized with cat genes from other bacterial genera. however, the catp gene was similar to the cloned catd gene from clostridium difficile. comparative studies with both catp and catd probes showed that these genes had significant restriction identity. we therefore suggest that these genes were derived from a common source.

TI  == homology of a transferable tetracycline resistance determinant of clostridium difficile with streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis transposon tn916.
AB  == in several tetracycline-resistant (tetr) clostridium difficile strains, homology  with the tn916 part of plasmid pam120 dna was observed. this 15-kilobase transposon, carrying a tetr determinant, was originally found in streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis. hybridization experiments revealed that at least six of  seven hincii fragments of tn916, representing greater than 95% of its length, showed homology with dna of tetr c. difficile strains. therefore, a close relationship of the c. difficile tetr-determining element with the entire tn916 transposon can be assumed, although differences were observed concerning the number of hindiii cleavage sites within the transposon. in addition to strong hybridization of tetr determinants of c. difficile with tn916, weak signals were  detected when dna of tets c. difficile was hybridized with tn916. these weak signals could be attributed to a single internal hincii fragment of tn916.

TI  == pediatric gastroenteritis in primary care and in hospitalized patients.
AB  == one-hundred and fifty-seven consecutive children below seven years of age (primary care n = 48, hospitalized patients n = 109) with acute gastroenteritis of assumed infectious origin were studied. rotavirus was demonstrated by electron microscopy of faeces in 44% of all patients. the occurrence of rotavirus among patients in primary care, 15%, was significantly lower than among hospitalized patients, 57% (p less than 0.01). adenovirus was isolated in six per cent and enterovirus in two per cent of the patients with no differences between the two groups. yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter jejuni were demonstrated in each three per cent. salmonella and shigella spp. or giardia lamblia were not found in any cases. thus the cause of gastroenteritis was established in 58% of the patients. this figure was lower among patients in primary care (27%) than among hospitalized patients (72%), a difference mainly due to the high occurrence of rotavirus in the latter group. clostridium difficile was recovered in 20 cases (12%), eight of which harboured one more enteropathogenic agent. cultures from the nose and throat revealed streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis or group a, c and g streptococci in 58% of the patients with no differences regarding the occurrence of rotavirus in faeces. neither clostridium difficile nor respiratory tract pathogens were found to play a role in causation of gastroenteritis in the children investigated.

TI  == effect of streptococcus parvulus and peptostreptococcus magnus on cytotoxin levels of clostridium difficile in anaerobic continuous flow culture.
AB  == an anaerobic continuous flow (cf) culture method was used in order to study the effect of peptostreptococcus magnus and streptococcus parvulus, anaerobic gram-positive cocci which are members of intestinal bacterial flora, on growth and cytotoxin-activity of clostridium difficile. the growth- and the cytotoxin activity-patterns of c. difficile in an established cf culture of p. magnus were  similar to those of c. difficile alone. on the other hand, in the mixed culture system of c. difficile and s. parvulus, the cytotoxin levels were significantly lower as compared with c. difficile alone in spite of the fact that no differences existed between growth of c. difficile in mixed and single culture systems. the culture filtrate of p. magnus did not influence the growth and cytotoxin production of c. difficile, nor did that of s. parvulus have any effect on growth of c. difficile in static culture. the cytotoxin activity of c. difficile was, however, suppressed by the culture filtrate of s. parvulus. furthermore, when p. magnus or s. parvulus was statically cultured in a medium containing cytotoxic culture filtrate of c. difficile, the toxin in the medium was not inactivated.

TI  == pathogenicity of clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  == the relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. we used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two bacteroides spp., eight gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric gram-negative aerobic rods. abscesses were induced by all seven clostridium perfringens and three c. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. enhancement was observed mainly with c. perfringens in mixed infections. by contrast, other clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. clostridium difficile and c. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species.  this study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  == three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins a, b, and c, produced by kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. the antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. in vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. however, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of clostridium difficile. in experimental infections, aridicin a was effective against strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. after subcutaneous administration, aridicin a had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. the aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

TI  == review of the in vitro spectrum of activity of imipenem.
AB  == imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin, mk0787), a new carbapenem was found to have  the widest antimicrobial activity of currently available beta-lactam drugs. enterobacteriaceae had minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem of 8.0 micrograms/ml or less for 99.8 percent of clinical isolates. only rare strains of enterobacter species and proteus mirabilis have higher imipenem minimal inhibitory concentration results. hemophilus and neisseria species were inhibited, but minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem were higher than those reported for third-generation cephalosporins. only pseudomonas maltophilia  and pseudomonas cepacia strains were imipenem resistant (mic50 greater than 32 micrograms/ml) among the commonly isolated non-enteric gram-negative bacilli. all anaerobes were found susceptible to imipenem with the exception of some strains of clostridium difficile. staphylococcus species and non-enterococcal streptococci were very susceptible to imipenem. streptococcus faecalis had higher minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem (mic90 3.1 micrograms/ml) and s. faecium strains were frankly resistant. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates  had a mic90 of 27.2 micrograms imipenem/ml. imipenem was generally bactericidal except for marked minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentration differences with enterococci, listeria, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and  some p. aeruginosa strains. the minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of imipenem were not significantly influenced by organism inoculum size, probably because of its beta-lactamase stability to nearly all commonly encountered bacterial enzymes. imipenem was found to be an excellent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and a potent enzyme inducer. the induction characteristic seems responsible for the antagonistic interactions of imipenem with some enzyme-labile beta-lactams in combination. imipenem had limited stability in some in vitro susceptibility test systems. the 10 micrograms disk test or dry-form broth micro-dilution systems were preferred, applying the interpretive criteria from the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (m2-a3). imipenem-resistant strains were rarely found in clinical practice and bacteria resistant to newer beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were generally very susceptible to this new carbapenem.

(mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

TI  == [in vitro activity of several cytostatic drugs against aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria].
AB  == the human normal intestinal flora prevents the colonization of exogenous bacteria, maintaining a constant microecology: this property is called "colonization resistance". in leukemia patients antibiotics used for prevention and/or therapy of infectious episodes can alter the intestinal microecology, so that the gut can represent the trigger zone for generalized septicemia. moreover  cytotoxic drugs used in these patients can favour intestinal disturbances. in our study we evaluated the in vitro activity of three commonly used antineoplastic drugs (daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, methotrexate) against aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria and clostridium difficile that is the aetiological  agent of pseudomembranous colitis. daunorubicin proved to be the most active inhibiting, in concentration ranging from 16 to 128 micrograms/ml, 50% of bacteroides strains and 90% of clostridium difficile and enterococci strains tested. methotrexate showed activity only against some bacteroides strains, while cytosine arabinoside had no activity at all. we conclude that in these patients the use of these drugs may represent another factor of risk altering the intestinal flora and so lowering the colonization resistance.

AB  == thirty-two patients with skin infections were treated with augmentin, a combination of amoxycillin with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. these infections were primary skin sepsis (7), infected eczema (11), infected trauma (10) and leg ulcers (4). the majority of cases were caused by amoxycillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus either alone or in combination with streptococcus pyogenes. thirty patients (94%) responded to treatment with only one withdrawal (for side effects). side effects were limited to nausea (9%) diarrhoea (9%) and rash (3%). no patient with diarrhoea showed evidence of clostridium difficile toxin production in the stools. augmentin appears to be a safe, useful, effective antibiotic for the treatment of skin infections in general practice and in hospital. it may prove of particular value when mixed infections of penicillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes are present.

TI  == bacterial interference between clostridium difficile and normal fecal flora.
AB  == clostridium difficile has been shown to be the cause of virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis related to the administration of antimicrobial agents. it is possible that some antimicrobial agents alter the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation by c. difficile. the inhibitory activity of representative fecal bacteria from 23 anaerobic and aerobic genera against c. difficile was examined using two in vitro procedures. strains of bacteria in six of the genera inhibited the multiplication of c. difficile, with lactobacillus organisms and group d enterococci displaying  the most antagonistic activity. c. difficile was examined for its ability to inhibit the multiplication of several fecal strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. all eight strains of c. difficile tested inhibited the growth of particular strains of bacteria in the genera bacteroides, peptococcus, and peptostreptococcus.

TI  == antibacterial activities of a new stabilized thienamycin, n-formimidoyl thienamycin, in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of a new crystalline derivative of thienamycin, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787), was tested against 46 laboratory reference strains and 2,158 clinical isolates of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobes, and compared with cefoxitin, cefaxolin, carbenicillin, and amikacin. mk0787 was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against most bacteria tests. mk0787 was 16- to 500-fold more active than the other antibiotics against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and group a and group b streptococci, inhibiting most isolates at concentrations less than 0.031 micrograms/ml. the inhibition concentration against over 90% of 156 strains of streptococcus faecalis was 1 micrograms/ml. mk0787 had slightly less activity than carbenicillin against haemophilus influenzae. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of mk0787 against strains of enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., serratia marcescems. pseudomonas aeruginosa, and clostridium difficile that are resistant to currently available antibiotics were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. the only species found resistant to mk0787 was pseudomonas maltophilia, which was equally nonsusceptible to the other reference  antibiotics.

TI  == clindamycin-induced enterocolitis in hamsters.
AB  == a lethal enterocolitis was induced in hamsters by oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin in amounts comparable to those used in treatment of humans. the intestinal lesions were characterized histologically as an acute inflammatory reaction with pseudomembrane formation and resembled the lesions seen in humans with antibiotic-induced colitis. results of quantitative stool cultures showed the numbers of peptostreptococcus and corynebacterium decreased in animals with colitis after challenge with 100 mg of clindamycin/kg, while numbers of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and clindamycin-resistant clostridium sordellii and clostridium difficile increased. bacteria were not seen within the intestinal lesions. viruses were not isolated from hamsters with colitis. although the pathogenesis of this syndrome is not completely established, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the disease is caused by clostridial toxins and that the production of these toxins by organisms within the intestines is enhanced by the effects of clindamycin upon the bowel flora.

TI  == competitive effects of intestinal microflora on vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the coexistence of vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. the bacteria tested included a bacteroides sp, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens type a, 2 separate isolates of escherichia coli, 2 different lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas maltophilia, and streptococcus faecalis. each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. no single strain or species was found that would eliminate v cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. not until a combination of e coli, p mirabilis, and  s faecalis was present in the mice did v cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.

TI  == effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  == in the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. of the species tested, bacteroides oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. streptococcus mutans, clostridium difficile, a neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. a group k streptococcus and b. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. a peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. when this strain was combined with two clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. this polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. no net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
