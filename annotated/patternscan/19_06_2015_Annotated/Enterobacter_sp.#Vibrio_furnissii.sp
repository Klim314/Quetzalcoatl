TI  == purification, characterization and gene analysis of n-acetylglucosaminidase from  enterobacter sp. g-1.
AB  == enterobacter sp. g-1 is a bacterium isolated previously as a chitinase-producing  bacterium. we found this bacterium also produced n-acetylglucosaminidase and characterized that in this study. extracellular n-acetylglucosaminidase of 92.0 kda was purified near homogeneity by 8.57-fold from enterobacter sp. g-1. the optimum temperature and the optimum ph of the purified n-acetylglucosaminidase was 45 degrees c and 6.0, respectively. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of 23  residues of n-acetylglucosaminidase was identified. based on the n-terminal sequence, we amplified pieces of the dna fragments by pcr. using these pcr products as probes, we screened the genomic library and successfully isolated the entire n-acetylglucosaminidase gene (designated nag1) from enterobacter sp. g-1.  the nucleotide sequence of the nag1 gene was found to consist of 2,655 bp encoding a protein of 885 amino acid residues. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence from the nag1 gene found 97.3% identity with chitobiase from serratia marcescens, 54.4% identity with n,n'-diacetylchitobiase from vibrio harveyi, and 42.7% identity with n-acetylglucosaminidase (exoi) from vibrio furnissii. enzymatic activity assay of n-acetylglucosaminidase indicated stronger activity toward pnp-glcnac than pnp-(glcnac)2 or pnp-(glcnac)3.
