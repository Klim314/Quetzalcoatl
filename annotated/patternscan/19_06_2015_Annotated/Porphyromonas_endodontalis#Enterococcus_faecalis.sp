TI  == [synergistic effects of lysozyme with edta-2na on antibacterial activity].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the synergistic antibacterial effects of lysozyme with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (edta-2na) on enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) and porphyromonas endodontalis (p. endodontalis). methods: e. faecalis and p. endodontalis were cultured and adjusted to 10(8) cfu/ml. then 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 150 and 300 g/l of lysozyme were prepared with deionized water; and the lysozyme solutions were mixed with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 g/l of  edta-2na, respectively. the bacteria and lysosome with/without edta-2na interacted for 15 min, then water-soluble tetrazolium (wst) working solution was  added and the activity of the bacteria was calculated by measuring optical densities at 450 nm and 630 nm with microplate spectrophotometer. results: regarding the pure lysozyme from 0.5 g/l to 150 g/l, more e. faecalis and p. endodontalis were inhibited when the concentration of lysozyme was higher, especially for e. faecalis. there was synergistic effect of lysozyme with edta-2na on antibacterial activity, which was related to the concentration of lysozyme. on e. faecalis, the antibacterial activity of lysozyme with edta-2na was 1.2-3.7 folds than the pure lysozyme when the concentration of lysozyme was 0.5-50 g/l (p<0.05), and on p. endodontalis, the antibacterial activity of lysozyme with edta-2na was 1.3-3.5 folds than the pure lysozyme when the concentration of lysozyme was 0.5-10 g/l (p<0.05). when the concentration of lysozyme was higher than 100 g/l, edta-2na did not show synergistic effect on the antibacterial activity (p>0.05). conclusion: for e. faecalis and p. endodontalis, a low concentration of lysozyme with edta-2na showed significant synergistic antibacterial activity, while a high concentration of lysozyme with edta-2na did  not.

TI  == [study of association between parvimonas micra and pulp dominant pathogens in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis].
AB  == objective: to study the prevalence of parvimonas micra (pm) and the associations  between pm and pulp dominant pathogens in order to reflect the colonization of pm in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis. methods: a  total of 120 teeth diagnosed as chronic periradicular periodontitis from 104 patients were included into the study. the teeth were allocated into untreated (primary infectious) and root-canal- treated (secondary infectious) groups with 60 in either group. samples were collected from the root canals using sterile files and paper points, and subsequent extraction of bacterial dna was undertaken. the pm 16s rdna level was evaluated using 16s rdna pcr. the prevalence of pm in chronic periradicular periodontitis was determined accordingly. then, the associations of pm and enterococcus faecalis (ef), porphyromonas endodontalis (pe) as well as porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were analysed. results: pm was detected in 40% (24/60) of the samples from the primary infectious group, 5% (3/60) from the secondary infectious group. the prevalences  of pm from the two groups were different significantly (chi(2) = 21.06, p < 0.05). significant correlations (untreated group or = 5.98, root-canal-treated group or = 33.50) between pm and pe were identified in both groups, while the correlations between pm and pg as well as ef were not of significance, respectively. conclusions: a significantly higher relevance ratio of pm was estimated in the primary infectious group than the secondary infectious one. pm and pe were correlated significantly in the infected root canals, suggesting a symbiotic relation between these two bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite in endodontics.
AB  == one of the major objectives in endodontic therapy is to disinfect the entire root canal system. this goal may be achieved using mechanical instrumenation and chemical irrigation in conjunrction with medication of the root canal between treatment sessions. microorganisms and their by-products are considered to be the major cause of pulpal and periradicular patholic. in order to reduce or eliminate bacteria and popular tissue remnants, the use of various irrigation solution during treatment have been suggested. sodium hypochlorite (naoci), the most common irrigant, is an excellent nonspecific proteolytic and antimicrobial agent. the purpose of this paper is to review the antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite.

TI  == clustering behavior in microbial communities from acute endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: acute endodontic infections harbor heterogeneous microbial communities in both the root canal (rc) system and apical tissues. data comparing the microbial structure and diversity in endodontic infections in related ecosystems, such as rc with necrotic pulp and acute apical abscess (aaa), are scarce in the literature. the aim of this study was to examine the presence of selected endodontic pathogens in paired samples from necrotic rc and aaa using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed by the construction of cluster profiles. methods: paired samples of rc and aaa exudates were collected from 20 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of selected strict and facultative anaerobic strains. the frequency of species was compared between the rc and the aaa samples. a stringent neighboring clustering algorithm was applied to investigate  the existence of similar high-order groups of samples. a dendrogram was constructed to show the arrangement of the sample groups produced by the hierarchical clustering. results: all samples harbored bacterial dna. porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella nigrescens, filifactor alocis, and tannerela forsythia were frequently detected in both rc and aaa samples. the selected anaerobic species were distributed in diverse small bacteria consortia.  the samples of rc and aaa that presented at least one of the targeted microorganisms were grouped in small clusters. conclusions: anaerobic species were frequently detected in acute endodontic infections and heterogeneous microbial communities with low clustering behavior were observed in paired samples of rc and aaa.

TI  == an agar diffusion comparison of the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide at  five different concentrations with three different vehicles.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if varying the percent (by weight) of  aqueous calcium hydroxide or using different vehicles had an effect on its antibacterial efficacy against common endodontic pathogens in a pour plate/traditional streak agar diffusion model. mixtures of calcium hydroxide powder and sterile saline in 40, 50 and 60 percent concentrations and the commercial preparations ultracal xs and vitapex were tested against six known endodontic pathogens with an agar diffusion method. each medicament was placed in one of five wells, in each of 10 agar plates (n = 10), for cultures of each bacterial species. zones of inhibition were measured after 48 hours incubation for aerobes and 96 hours incubation for anaerobes. multiple one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc student neuman keuls evaluated the data at alpha = 0.05. larger zones of inhibition were consistently observed for higher concentrations of calcium hydroxide with statistical significance among the bacteria, particularly between 40% and 60%. vitapex had significantly smaller zones of inhibition than all other medicaments and 35% ultracal xs with methylcellulose was nearly as effective as 50% ca(oh)(2) in inhibitory activity. formulations containing 50-60% ca(oh)(2) or 35% ca(oh)(2) with aqueous methylcellulose are recommended as endodontic interappointment medicaments.

TI  == the antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy of tetracycline-integrated gutta-percha.
AB  == the purpose of this study was in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy of commercially available gutta-percha containing tetracycline on some potential endodontic pathogens. the test microorganisms were enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas endodontalis, and candida albicans . tetracycline-integrated gutta-percha (tgp) cones, tetracycline disc, and conventional gutta-percha cones  of the same size were placed on the inoculated plates. the plates were incubated  at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically. growth inhibition zones on each plate were inspected at 24, 48, and 72 h. tetracycline disc and tgp cones inhibited all the tested bacterial strains, however the greatest antimicrobial effect was seen on s. aureus. tetracycline disc and tgp seemed less effective on  e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. however, all tested treatments were unable to affect c. albicans . based on the results of this study, it seems that tgp offers an antimicrobial advantage over conventional gutta-percha.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. the antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. the growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by naocl  and chlorhexidine solution. the largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all naocl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). however, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. the results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of a root canal core material.
AB  == background: the authors conducted an in vitro study to determine the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of a recently introduced thermoplastic, synthetic, polymer-based polyester root canal core material (resilon, resilon research, madison, conn.) against five different microorganisms by means of the agar diffusion test over different periods. methods: the microorganisms tested were enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas endodontalis and candida albicans. a microbiologist transferred resilon cones and gutta-percha cones to the inoculated agar and incubated them at 37 c, either aerobically or anaerobically, as required for optimal growth. results: the resilon cones exhibited no antimicrobial effect against any of the bacteria tested, except for s. aureus. it showed antimicrobial efficacy against s. aureus during the first 24-hour period (p < .05). however, after 48 and 72 hours, resilon cones no longer inhibited the growth of s. aureus. in addition, the material demonstrated no antifungal activity during any of the three testing  periods. conclusion: the results of this study indicate that the antibacterial and antifungal efficacy of the resilon cone is not superior to that of conventional gutta-percha. clinical implications: clinicians should not use the new root canal core material for its antimicrobial or antifungal efficacy.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine against  selected single-species biofilms.
AB  == aim: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 2.5% and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 2.0% chlorhexidine gel and liquid as endodontic-irrigating substances against selected single-species biofilms. methods: single-species biofilms of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were generated on a cellulose nitrate membrane placed on  agar medium. the biofilms were then immersed in the endodontic-irrigating substances for 30 s and also for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, with and without mechanical agitation. sterile saline was used as control. after each time period, the membrane filters were then transferred to tubes containing 2 ml of fresh broth medium plus neutralizers (in order to prevent the residual action of the tested substances). the micro-organisms were suspended using a vortex, and the inoculum was serially diluted 10-fold. aliquots of the dilutions were plated on 5% sheep blood agar medium, and incubated under adequate gaseous conditions. colony-forming units were calculated. the samples were compared using the friedman and tukey test, when necessary, at a significance level of p < 0.05. results: mechanical agitation promoted the effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents, resulting in less time to eliminate the same micro-organisms, except for  s. aureus with 2.5% naocl. antimicrobial agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine, killed the tested micro-organisms more rapidly. saline did not inhibit the growth of any of the tested micro-organisms, with or without agitation, being statistically different (p < 0.05) from naocl and chlorhexidine. p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were eliminated in 30 s by all antimicrobial agents, with our without agitation, in contrast with the facultative and aerobe strains. conclusions: mechanical agitation improved the antimicrobial properties of the chemical substances tested using a biofilm model, favouring the agents in liquid  presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine gel used as intracanal medicament.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide (ca(oh)2) combined with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) gel against endodontic pathogens and to compare the results with the ones achieved by ca(oh)2 mixed with sterile water and by chx gel alone. two methods were used: the agar diffusion test and the direct contact test. ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel produced inhibitory zones ranging from 2.84 to 6.5 mm, and required from 30 seconds to 6 hours to eliminate all tested microorganisms. however, 2% chx gel showed the largest microbial growth zones from 4.33 to 21.67 mm, and required 1 minute or less to inhibit all tested microorganisms. a paste of ca(oh)2 plus sterile water  inhibited only the microorganisms with which it was in direct contact and required from 30 seconds to 24 hours to kill all tested microorganisms. in conclusion, 2% chx gel + ca(oh)2 showed better antimicrobial activity than ca(oh)2 manipulated with sterile water.

TI  == photodynamic therapy for endodontic disinfection.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the effects of photodynamic therapy (pdt) on endodontic pathogens in planktonic phase as well as on enterococcus faecalis biofilms in experimentally infected root canals of extracted teeth. strains of microorganisms were sensitized with methylene blue (25 microg/ml) for  5 minutes followed by exposure to red light of 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 j/cm2. methylene blue fully eliminated all bacterial species with the exception of e. faecalis (53% killing). the same concentration of methylene blue  in combination with red light (222 j/cm2) was able to eliminate 97% of e. faecalis biofilm bacteria in root canals using an optical fiber with multiple cylindrical diffusers that uniformly distributed light at 360 degrees. we conclude that pdt may be developed as an adjunctive procedure to kill residual bacteria in the root canal system after standard endodontic treatment.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the susceptibility of endodontic pathogens to calcium hydroxide combined with different vehicles.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] in combination with different vehicles against endodontic pathogens. for such purpose, a broth dilution test was performed. pastes were prepared with ca(oh)2 powder and the following vehicles: sterile water, glycerin, camphorated monochlorophenol (cmcp), cmcp + glycerin, polyethyleneglycol and cmcp + polyethyleneglycol. the time required for the pastes to produce negative cultures against the tested microorganisms was recorded and analyzed statistically using the kruskal wallis test at 5% significance level. timing for pastes to eliminate the aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms ranged from 6 to 24 h, while strict anaerobic microorganisms were inhibited within 30 s to 5 min. microbial susceptibility, ranked from weakest to strongest, can be presented as follows: enterococcus faecalis (the most resistant microorganism), candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis and prevotella intermedia (the last two microorganisms required the same time to be eliminated). in conclusion, calcium hydroxide pastes needed more time to eliminate facultative than anaerobic microorganisms. these findings suggest that the antimicrobial property is related both to paste formulation and to microbial susceptibility.

TI  == susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  == since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (pmc) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola and prevotella melaninogenica. the mic of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the mic of pmc from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. the highest mic value of pmc was detected for e. faecalis whereas e. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. the highest mic values of chlorhexidine  were observed for p. aeruginosa whereas e. coli and p. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. since the mic values observed are much  lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.

TI  == geographical differences in bacteria detected in endodontic infections using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is an innovative nucleic acid-based assay that has the highest sensitivity of any microbiological technique for the detection of bacteria. the purpose of this study was to use pcr to detect the presence of specific species of bacteria in samples collected from two geographical locations. microbial samples from abscesses of endodontic origin were collected from patients in portland, oregon, and rio de janeiro, brazil. pcrs with species-specific oligonucleotide primers for the 16s ribosomal rna gene were used for detection of the bacteria after dna extraction from each clinical sample. statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in  detection of the bacteria between the two geographical locations for prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, fusobacterium nucleatum,  and porphyromonas gingivalis, but not for porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium necrophorum, and enterococcus faecalis. these results suggest that  differences in bacteria detected or cultured in studies can be associated with geographical location.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of 0.2%, 1%, and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx gel and chx liquid), against endodontic pathogens and compare the results with the ones achieved by 0.5%, 1%,  2.5%, 4%, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (naocl). a broth dilution test was performed, and the timing for irrigants to kill microbial cells was recorded and  statistically analyzed. both 2.0% gel and liquid formulations eliminated staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans in 15 seconds, whereas the gel formulation killed enterococcus faecalis in 1 minute. all tested irrigants eliminated porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in 15 seconds. the timing required for 1.0% and 2.0% chx liquid to eliminate all microorganisms was the same required for 5.25% naocl. the antimicrobial action is related to type, concentration, and presentation form of  the irrigants as well as the microbial susceptibility.

TI  == microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. the test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. the zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedial intermedia. ca(oh)2 + cmcp + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. we conclude that anaerobic gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  == a small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (gf) and conventional (cv) mice. the selected microorganisms were: porphyromonas endodontalis (atcc 35406), eubacterium lentum  (atcc 25559), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc 27337), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 4083). only p. anaerobius, e. coli, and e. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both cv and gf mice. e. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in cv animals. p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were unable to colonize in cv and gf animals after single inoculation. it is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein  is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.
