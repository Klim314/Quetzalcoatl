TI  == antiviral activity of spm1605 against coxsackievirus b3.
AB  == bifidobacteria are considered one of the most beneficial probiotics and have been widely studied for their effects against specific pathogens. the present study investigated the antiviral activity of probiotics isolated from koreans against coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3). the effect of probiotic isolates against cvb3 was measured by the plaque assay and cellular toxicity of bifidobacteria in hela cells was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay. among 13 probiotic isolates, 3 bifidobacterium adolescentis, 2 bifidobacterium longum and 1 bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum had an antiviral effect against cvb3, while the others did not show such effect. b. adolescentis spm1605 showed the greatest inhibitory properties against cvb3. when the threshold cycle (ct) values for the treated b. adolescentis spm1605 samples were  compared to the results for the non-treated samples, it was shown that the amplified viral sequences from the cvb3 had their copy number lowered by b. adolescentis spm1605. moreover, the gene expression in infected hela cells was also inhibited by 50%. the results suggest that b. adolescentis spm1605 suppresses cvb3 and could be used as an alternative therapy against infectious diseases caused by coxsackieviruses.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of fecal bifidobacterium species in centenarians living in bama, guangxi, china.
AB  == centenarians constitute a significant subpopulation in the bama county of guangxi province in china. the beneficial effects of intestinal microbiota, especially bifidobacteria of centenarians, have been widely accepted; however, knowledge about bifidobacterium species in centenarians is not adequate. the aim of this study was to investigate the quantity and prevalence of fecal bifidobacterium in  healthy longevous individuals. fecal samples from eight centenarians from bama (aged 100 to 108 years), eight younger elderlies from bama (aged 80 to 99 years), and eight younger elderlies from nanning (aged 80 to 99 years) were analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, species-specific clone library, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction technology (qpcr). a total of eight different bifidobacterium species were detected. b. dentium, b. longum, b. thermophilum, b. pseudocatenulatum/b. catenulatum, and b. adolescentis were common in fecal of centenarians and young elderly. b. minimum, b. saecularmay/b.  pullorum/b. gallinarum, and b. mongoliense were found in centenarians but were absent in the younger elderlies. in addition, bifidobacterium species found in centenarians were different from those found in bama young elderly and nanning young elderly, and the principal differences were the significant increase in the population of b. longum (p < 0.05) and b. dentium (p < 0.05) and the reduction in the frequency of b. adolescentis (p < 0.05), respectively. centenarians tend to have more complex fecal bifidobacterium species than young elderlies from different regions.

TI  == inulin-type fructans modulate intestinal bifidobacterium species populations and  decrease fecal short-chain fatty acids in obese women.
AB  == background & aims: inulin-type fructans (itf) prebiotics promote changes in the composition and activity of the gut microbiota. the aim of this study was to determine variations on fecal short chain fatty acids (scfa) concentration in obese women treated with itf and to explore associations between bifidobacterium  species, scfa and host biological markers of metabolism. methods: samples were obtained in a randomized, double blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial, with  30 obese women randomly assigned to groups that received either 16 g/day itf (n = 15) or maltodextrin (n = 15) for 3 months. the qualitative and quantitative analysis of bifidobacterium spp. was performed in feces by pcr-dgge and q-pcr, and scfa profile was analyzed by gas chromatography. spearman correlation analysis was performed between the different variables analyzed. results: the species bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium adolescentis were significantly increased at the end of the treatment in the prebiotic group (p < 0.01) with being b. longum negatively correlated with serum lipopolysaccharide (lps) endotoxin (p < 0.01). total scfa,  acetate and propionate, that positively correlated with bmi, fasting insulinemia  and homeostasis model assessment (homa) (p < 0.05), were significantly lower in prebiotic than in placebo group after the treatment period. conclusions: itf consumption selectively modulates bifidobacterium spp. and decreases fecal scfa concentration in obese women. itf could lessen metabolic risk factors associated  with higher fecal scfa concentration in obese individuals.

TI  == mother-to-infant transmission of intestinal bifidobacterial strains has an impact on the early development of vaginally delivered infant's microbiota.
AB  == objectives: bifidobacterium species are one of the major components of the infant's intestine microbiota. colonization with bifidobacteria in early infancy  is suggested to be important for health in later life. however, information remains limited regarding the source of these microbes. here, we investigated whether specific strains of bifidobacteria in the maternal intestinal flora are transmitted to their infant's intestine. materials and methods: fecal samples were collected from healthy 17 mother and infant pairs (vaginal delivery: 12; cesarean section delivery: 5). mother's feces were collected twice before delivery. infant's feces were collected at 0 (meconium), 3, 7, 30, 90 days after  birth. bifidobacteria isolated from feces were genotyped by multilocus sequencing typing, and the transitions of bifidobacteria counts in infant's feces were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr. results: stains belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, were identified to be monophyletic between mother's and infant's intestine. eleven out of 12 vaginal delivered infants carried at least one monophyletic strain. the bifidobacterial counts of the species to which the monophyletic strains belong, increased predominantly in the infant's intestine within 3 days after birth. among infants delivered by c-section, monophyletic strains were not observed. moreover, the bifidobacterial counts were significantly lower than the vaginal delivered infants until 7 days of age. conclusions: among infants born vaginally, several bifidobacterium strains transmit from the mother and colonize the infant's intestine shortly after birth. our data suggest that the mother's intestine is an important source for the vaginal delivered infant's intestinal microbiota.

TI  == isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. in this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf) and pepsin hydrolysate of blf (blfh), isolated bifidogenic peptide from blfh, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra  of blf, blfh, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. against bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700(t), minimal effective concentrations of blf and blfh were 300 and 10 mug/ml. against bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697(t), the minimal effective concentration of blfh was 30 mug/ml, and blf did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. as an active peptide, a heterodimer of a(1)-w(16) and l(43)-a(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. an amino acid mixture with the same  composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. the strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 mum were as follows: b. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), b. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), b. longum subsp. longum (1/3), bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by blf at 3.75 mum. we demonstrated that blfh showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural  blf, especially against infant-representative species, b. breve and b. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. this is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from blf.

TI  == fecal microbiota composition differs between children with beta-cell autoimmunity and those without.
AB  == the role of the intestinal microbiota as a regulator of autoimmune diabetes in animal models is well-established, but data on human type 1 diabetes are tentative and based on studies including only a few study subjects. to exclude secondary effects of diabetes and hla risk genotype on gut microbiota, we compared the intestinal microbiota composition in children with at least two diabetes-associated autoantibodies (n = 18) with autoantibody-negative children matched for age, sex, early feeding history, and hla risk genotype using pyrosequencing. principal component analysis indicated that a low abundance of lactate-producing and butyrate-producing species was associated with beta-cell autoimmunity. in addition, a dearth of the two most dominant bifidobacterium species, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and  an increased abundance of the bacteroides genus were observed in the children with beta-cell autoimmunity. we did not find increased fecal calprotectin or iga  as marker of inflammation in children with beta-cell autoimmunity. functional studies related to the observed alterations in the gut microbiome are warranted because the low abundance of bifidobacteria and butyrate-producing species could  adversely affect the intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammation, whereas the apparent importance of the bacteroides genus in development of type 1 diabetes is insufficiently understood.

TI  == long-term changes in human colonic bifidobacterium populations induced by a 5-day oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the possible modifications due to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc) treatment on total bacteria and on bifidobacterium species balance in human colonic microbiota. eighteen healthy volunteers (19 to 36 years old) were given a 875/125 mg dose of amc twice a day for 5 days. fecal samples were obtained before and after antibiotic exposure. after total dna extraction, total bacteria and bifidobacteria were specifically quantified using real-time pcr. dominant species were monitored over time using bacterial and bifidobacterial temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). at the end of amc exposure, total bacterial concentrations as well as bifidobacteria concentrations were significantly reduced compared to before amc exposure:10.7+/-0.1 log(10) 16s rrna gene copies/g vs 11.1+/-0.1 log(10) (p = 0.003) and 8.1+/-0.5 log(10) 16s rrna gene copies/g vs 9.4+/-0.3 log(10) (p = 0.003), respectively. at the same time, the mean similarity percentages of ttge bacteria and ttge bifidobacteria profiles were significantly reduced compared to  before amc exposure: 51.6%+/-3.5% vs 81.4%+/-2.1% and 55.8%+/-7.6% vs 84.5%+/-4.1%, respectively. occurrence of b. adolescentis, b. bifidum and b. pseudocatenulatum/b. catenulatum species significantly decreased. occurrence of b. longum remained stable. moreover, the number of distinct bifidobacterium species per sample significantly decreased (1.5+/-0.3 vs 2.3+/-0.3; p = 0.01). two months after amc exposure, the mean similarity percentage of ttge profiles was 55.6% for bacteria and 62.3% for bifidobacteria. these results clearly demonstrated that a common antibiotic treatment may qualitatively alter the colonic microbiota. such modifications may have potential long-term physiological consequences.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == folate production by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == probiotic bacteria, mostly belonging to the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, confer a number of health benefits to the host, including vitamin production. with the aim to produce folate-enriched fermented products and/or develop probiotic supplements that accomplish folate biosynthesis in vivo  within the colon, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli have been extensively studied for their capability to produce this vitamin. on the basis of physiological studies and genome analysis, wild-type lactobacilli cannot synthesize folate, generally require it for growth, and provide a negative contribution to folate levels in fermented dairy products. lactobacillus plantarum constitutes an exception among lactobacilli, since it is capable of folate production in presence of para-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and deserves to be used in animal trials to validate its ability to produce the vitamin in vivo. on the other hand, several folate-producing strains have been selected within the genus bifidobacterium, with a great variability in the extent of vitamin released in the medium. most of them belong to the species b. adolescentis and b. pseudocatenulatum, but few folate producing strains are found in the other species as well. rats fed a probiotic formulation of folate-producing bifidobacteria exhibited increased plasma folate level, confirming that the vitamin is produced in vivo and absorbed. in a human trial, the same supplement raised folate concentration in feces. the use of folate-producing probiotic strains can be regarded as a new perspective in the specific use of probiotics. they could more efficiently confer protection against inflammation and cancer, both exerting the beneficial effects of probiotics and preventing the folate deficiency that is associated with premalignant changes in the colonic epithelia.

TI  == secretor genotype (fut2 gene) is strongly associated with the composition of bifidobacteria in the human intestine.
AB  == intestinal microbiota plays an important role in human health, and its composition is determined by several factors, such as diet and host genotype. however, thus far it has remained unknown which host genes are determinants for the microbiota composition. we studied the diversity and abundance of dominant bacteria and bifidobacteria from the faecal samples of 71 healthy individuals. in this cohort, 14 were non-secretor individuals and the remainders were secretors.  the secretor status is defined by the expression of the abh and lewis histo-blood group antigens in the intestinal mucus and other secretions. it is determined by  fucosyltransferase 2 enzyme, encoded by the fut2 gene. non-functional enzyme resulting from a nonsense mutation in the fut2 gene leads to the non-secretor phenotype. pcr-dgge and qpcr methods were applied for the intestinal microbiota analysis. principal component analysis of bifidobacterial dgge profiles showed that the samples of non-secretor individuals formed a separate cluster within the secretor samples. moreover, bifidobacterial diversity (p<0.0001), richness (p<0.0003), and abundance (p<0.05) were significantly reduced in the samples from the non-secretor individuals as compared with those from the secretor individuals. the non-secretor individuals lacked, or were rarely colonized by, several genotypes related to b. bifidum, b. adolescentis and b. catenulatum/pseudocatenulatum. in contrast to bifidobacteria, several bacterial genotypes were more common and the richness (p<0.04) of dominant bacteria as detected by pcr-dgge was higher in the non-secretor individuals than in the secretor individuals. we showed that the diversity and composition of the human bifidobacterial population is strongly associated with the histo-blood group abh  secretor/non-secretor status, which consequently appears to be one of the host genetic determinants for the composition of the intestinal microbiota. this association can be explained by the difference between the secretor and non-secretor individuals in their expression of abh and lewis glycan epitopes in  the mucosa.

TI  == amoxicillin treatment modifies the composition of bifidobacterium species in infant intestinal microbiota.
AB  == objectives: amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic largely used in childhood. however only few studies described its impact on composition of children gut microbiota, in particular on bifidobacterium populations considered as beneficial microorganisms. in this study, the impact on faecal bifidobacterium species of a  seven-day amoxicillin treatment was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed in  infants during an episode of acute respiratory infection. methods: faecal samples from 31 infants were obtained on day 0 (just before amoxicillin therapy) and on day 7 (the end of therapy). total dna was extracted and bifidobacteria were quantified using real-time pcr. predominant bifidobacterium species were then identified using specific pcr-ttge. results: bifidobacteria concentrations were not significantly altered by amoxicillin compared to the healthy group. however,  amoxicillin treatment induced a complete disappearance of bifidobacterium adolescentis species (occurrence rate of 0% versus 36.4% in healthy group, p < 0.001), a significant decrease in the occurrence rate of bifidobacterium bifidum  (23% versus 54.5% in healthy group, p < 0.05), but did not affect bifidobacterium longum (93.5% versus 100% in healthy group) and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum/b. catenulatum (about 55% in both groups). the number of bifidobacterium species per microbiota significantly decreased from 2.5 +/- 1 for healthy group to 1.8 +/- 0.9 for treated infants (p < 0.05). conclusions: this study showed that a 7 day amoxicillin treatment did not alter the counts of bifidobacterium. however amoxicillin can have an impact by changing the microbiota at the species level and decreased the diversity of this population.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == isolation of bifidobacteria from breast milk and assessment of the bifidobacterial population by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == the objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by f6ppk (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time pcr (qrti-pcr). bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. dentium. bifidobacterial dna was detected by qrti-pcr in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16s rrna gene copies per ml. in conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.

TI  == quantification of folic acid in human feces after administration of bifidobacterium probiotic strains.
AB  == background: folic acid, or vitamin b9, is involved in appropriate regulation of dna replication, synthesis of purines and deoxythymidine (dtmp), conversion of homocysteine to methionine, histidine catabolism, and correct differentiation of  the neural tube during fetal organogenesis. folic acid from food sources is almost completely absorbed in the small intestine, mostly in the jejunum, and does not reach the large intestine. the administration of probiotic strains able  to synthesize folates de novo and release them in the extracellular space may provide an additional, constant endogenous source of this important vitamin in the intestinal lumen of humans. methods: a pilot study involving 23 healthy volunteers was conducted to evaluate the ability of 3 probiotic strains, bifidobacterium adolescentis dsm 18350, b. adolescentis dsm 18352, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum dsm 18353, to produce folates in the human intestine. volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups for treatment with  a specific probiotic strain (5 x 10(9) colony forming units/d). strain effectiveness was evaluated by determination of the folate concentration in feces evacuated within 48 hours before and after administration of the probiotics. quantification of microorganisms belonging to the genus bifidobacterium was performed in parallel to folate analysis. results: ingestion of these probiotic strains resulted in a significant increase of folic acid concentration in human feces in all treated groups. analysis of the fecal bifidobacteria confirmed the potential of all strains, especially b. adolescentis dsm 18352, to colonize the intestinal environment. conclusions: the demonstrated ability of the probiotic microorganisms b. adolescentis dsm 18350, b. adolescentis dsm 18352, and b. pseudocatenulatum dsm 18353 to synthesize and secrete folates in the human intestinal environment may provide a complementary endogenous source of such molecules, which is especially useful for the homeostasis of mucosal enterocytes  of the colon and, unlike oral administration of the vitamin, ensures its constant bioavailability.

AB  == twenty-eight exclusively breast-fed healthy infants and 16 infants also exclusively breast-fed with allergic colitis (aged 85 +/- 60 and 98 +/- 58 d, respectively) were screened for differences in fecal flora. bifidobacteria were detected in 23 healthy infants and only in 4 fecal samples of infants with allergic colitis. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific fish probe. infants with allergy colitis possessed significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria and total anaerobes and significantly higher counts of clostridia in their feces. in healthy infants, bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently found species (54.5% of the samples), followed by b. adolescentis (20.0), b. breve (18.2), b. bifidum (16.4), b. dentium (10.9) and b. pseudocatenulatum (1.80). bifidobacterial isolates from  two babies with allergic colitis were identified as b. longum, one child from patients group contained species b. dentium and one baby b. adolescentis. our results suggest that there are significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria in infants with allergic colitis than in healthy infants.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

TI  == evaluation of the pcr method for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == aims: bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. although various polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods for the identification of bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. methods and results: in this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported pcr primer sets designed to amplify 16s rdna, 23s rdna, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive  dna sequences of various bifidobacterium species. conclusions: ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. longum biovar infantis and b. dentium. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest that published bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of bifidobacterium species using pcr. improvement of existing pcr methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other bifidobacterium strains, such as b. animalis, b. catenulatum, b. thermophilum and b. subtile.

TI  == administration of folate-producing bifidobacteria enhances folate status in wistar rats.
AB  == to develop a probiotic that provides the host with folate, we administered folate-overproducing bifidobacteria (bifidobacteria adolescentis mb 227, b. adolescentis mb 239, and b. pseudocatenulatum mb 116) to wistar rats with induced folate deficiency. four groups of rats were fed a solid, low-folate diet with no  supplements, folate-producing bifidobacteria [probiotic (pro)], oligofructose [prebiotic (pre)], or pro plus pre [symbiotic (sym)] for 14 d. the sym group also had a significantly higher (16.4 +/- 3.7 nmol/l) than in the pro group (9.1 +/- 0.3 nmol/l), which was greater than in the control (4.8 +/- 0.5 nmol/l) and pre groups (5.3 +/- 1.4 nmol/l). the sym group also had a significantly higher hepatic folate concentration than in the other groups, whereas the kidney folate  concentration did not differ among the groups. in the unsupplemented group, the ph of feces did not change during the trial, whereas diets containing bifidobacteria and/or oligofructose led to significant acidification due to enhanced saccharolytic metabolism. as a consequence of feeding rats pre, pro, and sym diets, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were significantly greater than in controls, whereas coliforms and enterococci were lower. this experiment showed that b. adolescentis mb 227, b. adolescentis mb 239, and b. pseudocatenulatum mb  116 exert both the beneficial effects of probiotics and produce folate in vivo, positively affecting the folate status of rats. the simultaneous administration of oligofructose and folate-producing bifidobacteria enhance their effectiveness  on folate status. this study provides new perspectives on the specific use of probiotics to deliver important vitamins such as folate.

TI  == molecularly assessed shifts of bifidobacterium ssp. and less diverse microbial communities are characteristic of 5-year-old allergic children.
AB  == the composition of intestinal microbiota and the bifidobacterium group community  in 20 allergic and 20 nonallergic 5-year-old children was visualized by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the number of dominant bands  in the dgge profiles was smaller in allergic children than in nonallergic children (p<0.001). allergic children mainly formed a single group upon cluster analysis, whereas nonallergic children were divided between four different groups. in allergic children the bifidobacterium adolescentis species prevailed,  and in nonallergic children the bifidobacterium catenulatum/pseudocatenulatum prevailed (p=0.01 and p=0.01, respectively). the less diverse composition of intestinal microbiota and prevalence of particular species of bifidobacterium were characteristic of allergic children even at the age of 5 years.

TI  == characterization of the genus bifidobacterium by automated ribotyping and 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == in order to characterize the genus bifidobacterium, ribopatterns and approximately 500 bp (escherichia coli positions 27 to 520) of 16s rrna gene sequences of 28 type strains and 64 reference strains of the genus bifidobacterium were determined. ribopatterns obtained from bifidobacterium strains were divided into nine clusters (clusters i-ix) with a similarity of 60%. cluster v, containing 17 species, was further subdivided into 22 subclusters with a similarity of 90%. in the genus bifidobacterium, four groups were shown according to miyake et al.: (i) the bifidobacterium longum infantis-longum-suis type group, (ii) the b. catenulatum-pseudocatenulatum group, (iii) the b. gallinarum-saeculare-pullorum group, and (iv) the b. coryneforme-indicum group, which showed higher than 97% similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequences in each group. using ribotyping analysis, unique ribopatterns were obtained from these species, and they could be separated by cluster analysis. ribopatterns of six b.  adolescentis strains were separated into different clusters, and also showed diversity in 16s rrna gene sequences. b. adolescentis consisted of heterogeneous  strains. the nine strains of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum were divided into five subclusters. each type strain of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum and b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum and two intermediate groups, which were suggested by yaeshima et al., consisted of individual clusters. b. animalis subsp. animalis and b. animalis subsp. lactis could not be separated by ribotyping using eco ri. we conclude that ribotyping is able to provide another characteristic of bifidobacterium strains in addition to 16s rrna gene sequence phylogenetic analysis, and this information suggests that ribotyping analysis is  a useful tool for the characterization of bifidobacterium species in combination  with other techniques for taxonomic characterization.

TI  == evaluation of amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) and species-specific pcr for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == molecular biological methods based on genus-specific pcr, species-specific pcr, and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) of two pcr amplicons (523 and 914bp) using six restriction enzymes were used to differentiate among species of bifidobacterium. the techniques were established using dna from 16 type and reference strains of bifidobacteria of 11 species. the discrimination power of 914bp amplicon digestion was higher than that of 523bp amplicon digestion. the 914bp amplicon digestion by six restrictases provided unique patterns for nine species; b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were not differentiated yet. the ncii digestion of the 914bp pcr product enabled to discriminate between each of b. animalis, b. lactis, and b. gallicum. the reference strain b. adolescentis ccm 3761 was reclassified as a member of the b.  catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum group. the above-mentioned methods were applied  for the identification of seven strains of bifidobacterium spp. collected in the  culture collection of dairy microorganisms (ccdm). the strains collected in ccdm  were differentiated to the species level. six strains were identified as b. lactis, one strain as b. adolescentis.

TI  == [analysis of bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut via temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge)].
AB  == temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge) method combined with 16s rdna clone library profiling was used to analyze bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut in this study. bifidobacteria group-specific tgge patterns of 10 healthy human individuals showed that the bifidobacteria population in humans was host-specific. the genomic diversity and species composition of bifidobacteria in different individual was dissimilar. through sequencing and tgge comigration analysis of the bifidobacteria group-specific amplicons for one healthy boy, it was revealed that the tgge bands of this individual represented species bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. pseudocatenulatum and one potentially new species, respectively. b. pseudocatenulatum was the most common species of tested samples. while as control, only two species- b. pseudocatenulatum and b. longum were isolated using traditional culture method. bifidobacteria group-specific pcr based tgge method combined with 16s rdna clone library profiling is a sensitive and effective approach to resolve the population structure of bifidobacteria in microflora of human intestinal tract.

TI  == conditions affecting cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == the cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria have been characterized for 30 strains isolated from a fecal sample. strain identification  to the species level was obtained by restriction analysis of the amplified 16s rrna gene and confirmed by dna/dna reassociation experiments. the isolates were grouped in four genetically homogeneous clusters whose members belonged to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum species. cell surface properties of bifidobacterium strains were evaluated by determining the level of hydrophobicity, adhesion to hydrocarbons and contact angle measurements, and their autoaggregation ability. the results showed high and homogeneous level of hydrophobicity in all tested strains when contact angle measurements values were  considered. on the contrary, autoaggregation assays and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons detected interesting differences in cell surface properties among the tested bifidobacterium strains. the highest levels of autoaggregation, detected in b. bifidum and b. adolescentis strains, were strictly dependent on the ph of the medium. moreover, protease treatment experiments suggested that proteins had a key role in the autoaggregating ability of b. bifidum and b. adolescentis strains.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == phytase activity as a novel metabolic feature in bifidobacterium.
AB  == phytase activity has been detected for the first time in bifidobacterium spp. these bacteria were able to dephosphorylate phytic acid (myo-inositol hexaphosphate, ip(6)) and generate several myo-inositol phosphate intermediates (ip(3)-ip(5)). b. globosum and b. pseudocatenulatum were optimally active at neutral-alkaline ph and b. adolescentis, b. angulatum and b. longum at acid ph. b. pseudocatenulatum showed the highest levels of phytase activity. this species  produced maximum activity in the exponential phase of growth and when fructo-oligosaccharides were used as carbon source in the culture medium. the potential role of phytase activity from bifidobacterium spp. in the reduction of  the antinutritional properties of ip(6) is discussed.

TI  == genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from  intestinal samples of finnish adult subjects. methods and results: a total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. identification results obtained with pcr-elisa and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly  amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) gave tentative identification only to bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the b. longum isolates. the most commonly detected species were b. longum biotype longum followed by b. adolescentis and b. bifidum. in addition, b. animalis (lactis), b. angulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were found. ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also rapd revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. besides two b. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. conclusions: several species/strains of bifidobacteria  simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy finnish adults and  intestinal bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. significance and impact of the study: applicability of ribotyping with the automated riboprinter system for  identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.

TI  == enumeration, isolation, and identification of bifidobacteria from infant feces.
AB  == thirty-three fully breast-fed infants aged between 1 and 12 weeks were screened for bifidobacteria in feces. bifidobacteria counts in most fecal samples determined both by tpy agar and fish procedure ranged from 10(8) to 10(11) cfu/g. three infants did not contain any bifidobacteria in their fecal samples. one child was delivered by caesarean section and the other two by normal vaginal delivery. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia  using genus-specific fish probe. in bifidobacteria-positive samples, b. longum (57.9% of the samples) was the most frequently found species, followed by b. adolescentis (31.6%), b. bifidum (21.0%), b. breve (10.5%), b. pseudocatenulatum  (5.3%), and b. dentium (5.3%).

TI  == in vitro digestion of sinigrin and glucotropaeolin by single strains of bifidobacterium and identification of the digestive products.
AB  == three strains of bifidobacterium sp., b. pseudocatenulatum, b. adolescentis, and  b. longum were studied for their ability to digest glucosinolates, sinigrin (sng) and glucotropaeolin (gtl), in vitro. all strains digested both glucosinolates during 24-48 h cultivation, accompanied by a decline in the medium ph from 7.1 to 5.2. the digestion of glucosinolates by a cell-free extract prepared from sonicated cells of b. adolescentis, but not cultivated broth, increased in the presence of 0.5 mm l-ascorbic acid. also, a time-dependent formation of allyl isothiocyanate (aitc) was observed when the cell-free extract was incubated with  0.25 mm sng for 120 min at ph 7.0. these reaction features suggest that the digestive activity may have been due to an enzyme similar to myrosinase, an enzyme of plant origin. gc-ms analysis of the bifidobacterial cultured broth showed that the major products were 3-butenenitrile (bcn) and phenylacetonitrile  (phacn), from sng and gtl, respectively and nitriles, probably due to a decrease  in the ph of the media. aitc and benzyl isothiocyanate (bzitc) were barely detectable in the broth. it was concluded that the three species of bifidobacteria could be involved in digestive degradation of glucosinolates in the human intestinal tract.

TI  == multiplex pcr using 16s rrna gene-targeted primers for the identification of bifidobacteria from human origin.
AB  == three multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) targeted on bifidobacterium and related species were designed to identify human species. the selected primers yielded amplified products of various sizes, each specific for a species. three to four pairs were gathered in one pcr reaction and their specificity under multiplex conditions was confirmed using dna from 26 reference strains. using this technique on unidentified faecal strains, b. bifidum, b. longum and b. breve species were commonly recovered in infants while b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum continuum and b. longum species were predominant in adults. thus, a single pcr can provide the assignment of a strain to one these species, reducing the number of pcr reactions and hands-on time for the identification of human isolates of bifidobacteria. moreover, this technique is also applicable for the in situ detection of bifidobacteria in dna extracts from  human stools.

TI  == species specific identification of nine human bifidobacterium spp. in feces.
AB  == based on the 16s rdna sequences, species specific primers were designed for the rapid identification by dna amplification of nine human bifidobacterium spp., namely b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. infantis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum. b. lactis currently included in dairy products was added to the series. the primers were designed to  target different positions of the 16s rdna, allowing the simultaneous identification of these ten species of bifidobacterium using two mixtures of primers. the identification procedure described in this paper was validated by establishing a correlation with an alui restriction pattern of the different full length amplified 16s rdna. this multiple primer dna amplification technique was applied for the identification of pure colonies of bifidobacterium spp. or directly from total bacteria recovered from human fecal samples. the technique was shown to be useful to detect dominant species and, when primers were used in  separate reactions, underrepresented species could be identified as well.

TI  == identification, detection, and enumeration of human bifidobacterium species by pcr targeting the transaldolase gene.
AB  == methods that enabled the identification, detection, and enumeration of bifidobacterium species by pcr targeting the transaldolase gene were tested. bifidobacterial species isolated from the feces of human adults and babies were identified by pcr amplification of a 301-bp transaldolase gene sequence and comparison of the relative migrations of the dna fragments in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). two subtypes of bifidobacterium longum, five subtypes of bifidobacterium adolescentis, and two subtypes of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum could be differentiated using pcr-dgge. bifidobacterium angulatum and b. catenulatum type cultures could not be differentiated from each  other. bifidobacterial species were also detected directly in fecal samples by this combination of pcr and dgge. the number of species detected was less than that detected by pcr using species-specific primers targeting 16s ribosomal dna (rdna). real-time quantitative pcr targeting a 110-bp transaldolase gene sequence was used to enumerate bifidobacteria in fecal samples. real-time quantitative pcr measurements of bifidobacteria in fecal samples from adults correlated well with  results obtained by culture when either a 16s rdna sequence or the transaldolase  gene sequence was targeted. in the case of samples from infants, 16s rdna-targeted pcr was superior to pcr targeting the transaldolase gene for the quantification of bifidobacterial populations.

TI  == molecular microbial analysis of bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra).
AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

(13)c-nmr spectroscopy  confirmed the presence of predominantly beta-(2,6)-fructosyl linkages in the oligosaccharides. more than 80% beta-(2,6)-fos was recovered after in vitro incubation with amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes, implying resistance to degradation in the upper intestinal tract. bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. longum, b. breve, and b. pseudocatenulatum were studied in vitro for their ability to metabolize beta-(2,6)-fos. growth, decrease in ph, formation of short- chain fatty acids (lactate, acetate, formate) and degradation of beta-(2,6)-fos were markedly different among species. b. adolescentis showed the best growth, produced the highest amounts of organic acids and metabolized both short- and long-chain beta-(2, 6)-fos.

TI  == phenotypic differentiation of bifidobacteria of human and animal origins.
AB  == the phenotypes of 153 strains belonging or related to the genus bifidobacterium were studied. these organisms included 38 collection strains and 115 wild strains (41 strains of human origin, 56 strains of animal origin, and 18 strains obtained from rivers or sewage). our phenotypic analysis revealed seven main groups that were subdivided into 20 subgroups. seven subgroups contained no type or collection strain. among the human strains, the type strains of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and b. catenulatum fell into group i, which contained the type  strains of b. adolescentis (subgroup ib), b. dentium (subgroup ic), and b. angulatum (ungrouped). the type strain of b. breve belonged to subgroup iiia1, and the type strains of b. infantis and b. longum fell into subgroup iiib1. group vii comprised only wild strains that were isolated from human infant feces. among the animal strains, group ii consisted mainly of bifidobacteria that were isolated from pig feces and contained the type strains of b. suis (subgroup iib), b. thermophilum (subgroup iif), b. choerinum, and b. boum (ungrouped). wild strains belonging to group v were isolated from pig, calf, cow, and chicken feces; this included the type strains of b. animalis (subgroup va), b. magnum (subgroup vb), b. pseudolongum, and b. globosum (subgroup vc). the strains of human origin (groups i, iii, and vii) were well separated from the animal strains (groups ii, iv, and v). it was not surprising that the wild strains isolated from surface water or sewage were distributed in the animal groups as well as the human groups. thus, bifidobacteria can be considered to be successful indicators  of human or animal fecal pollution when they are correctly classified. the acidification patterns were not adequate to differentiate bifidobacterium species, as determined previously by mitsuoka (bifidobacteria microflora 3:11-28, 1984) and scardovi (p. 1418-1434, in p. h. a. sneath, n. s. mair, m. e. sharpe, and j. g. holt, ed., bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology, vol. 2, 1986). however, enzymatic tests furnished new taxonomic criteria for the genus.
