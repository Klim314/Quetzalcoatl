vaginal lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 can inhibit herpes simplex type 2 but not coxsackievirus b4e2.
this study aimed at demonstrating the antiviral activity of lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 (l. gasseri cmul57), l. acidophilus cmul67 and l. plantarum cmul140 against herpes simplex type 2 (hsv-2) and coxsackievirus b4e2 (cvb4e2), which are enveloped and naked viruses, respectively. these lactobacilli were non-cytotoxic and were able to reduce the cytopathic effect induced by hsv-2 in vero cell monolayers. however, lactobacilli were not active against cvb4e2. tested lactobacilli displayed anti-hsv-2 activity when they were co-incubated with the virus prior to inoculating the mixture to vero cell monolayers. the detection of hsv-2 dna by pcr in pellets of bacteria/virus mixtures let us to hypothesize that anti-hsv-2 activity of lactobacilli resulted from the viruses' entrapment. this study showed the capabilities of vaginal lactobacilli to inhibit enveloped viruses such as hsv-2.
solution structure of acidocin b, a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46.
acidocin b, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46, was originally reported to be a linear peptide composed of 59 amino acid residues. however, its high sequence similarity to gassericin a, a circular bacteriocin from lactobacillus gasseri la39, suggested that acidocin b might be circular as well. acidocin b was purified from culture supernatant by a series of hydrophobic interaction chromatographic steps. its circular nature was ascertained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) sequencing. the peptide sequence was found to consist of 58 amino acids with a molecular mass of 5,621.5 da. the sequence of the acidocin b biosynthetic gene cluster was also determined and showed high nucleotide sequence similarity to that of gassericin a. the nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) solution structure of acidocin b in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles was elucidated, revealing that it is composed of four alpha-helices of similar length that are folded to form a compact, globular bundle with a central pore. this is a three-dimensional structure for a member of subgroup ii circular bacteriocins, which are classified based on their isoelectric points of approximately 7 or lower. comparison of acidocin b with carnocyclin a, a subgroup i circular bacteriocin with four alpha-helices and a pi of 10, revealed differences in the overall folding. the observed variations could be attributed to inherent diversity in their physical properties, which also required the use of different solvent systems for three-dimensional structural elucidation.
detection and quantification of probiotic strain lactobacillus gasseri k7 in faecal samples by targeting bacteriocin genes.
lactobacillus gasseri k7 is a probiotic strain that produces bacteriocins gassericin k7 a and k7 b. in order to develop a real-time quantitative pcr assay for the detection of l. gasseri k7, 18 reference strains of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and 45 faecal samples of adults who have never consumed strain k7 were tested with pcr using 14 pairs of primers specific for gassericin k7 a and k7 b gene determinants. incomplete gassericin k7 a or k7 b gene clusters were found to be dispersed in different lactobacilli strains as well as in faecal microbiota. one pair of primers was found to be specific for the total gene cluster of gassericin k7a and one for gassericin k7b. the real-time pcr analysis of faecal samples spiked with k7 strain revealed that primers specific for the gene cluster of the gassericin k7 a were more suitable for quantitative determination than those for gassericin k7 b, due to the lower detection level. targeting of the gassericin k7 a or k7 b gene cluster with specific primers could be used for detection and quantification of l. gasseri k7 in human faecal samples without prior cultivation. the results of this study also present new insights into the prevalence of bacteriocin-encoding genes in gastrointestinal tract.
genomic and phenotypic evidence for probiotic influences of lactobacillus gasseri on human health.
certain lactic acid bacteria (lab) have the capacity to occupy mucosal niches of  humans, including the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina. among commensal, lab are species of the acidophilus complex, which have proven to be a substantial reservoir for microorganisms with probiotic attributes. specifically, lactobacillus gasseri is an autochthonous microorganism which has been evaluated for probiotic activity based on the availability of genome sequence and species-specific adaptation to the human mucosa. niche-related characteristics of l. gasseri contributing to indigenous colonization include tolerance of low ph environments, resistance to bile salts, and adhesion to the host epithelium. in humans, l. gasseri elicits various health benefits through its antimicrobial activity, bacteriocin production, and immunomodulation of the innate and adaptive systems. the genomic and empirical evidence supporting use of l. gasseri in probiotic applications is substantiated by clinical trial data displaying maintenance of vaginal homeostasis, mitigation of helicobacter pylori infection, and amelioration of diarrhea.
differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.
isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus), gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3, cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.
characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of 7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins, amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.
lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l. gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.
chromosomal location of the genetic determinants for bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus gasseri k7.
the production of similar or even identical bacteriocins by different lactic acid bacteria is not a rare event. to take advantage of this finding, genetic determinants of the lactobacillus k7 bacteriocins were tested for putative homologies with previously described bacteriocins of the lactobacillus acidophilus group through polymerase chain reaction (pcr). among specific primer pairs of seven known bacteriocins, derived from their respective sequences, only acidocin lf221 a and b primers amplified fragments in chromosomal dna of k7 strain that revealed strong similarity over small regions of lf221 bacteriocins. treatment of lactobacillus k7 with ethidium bromide and mitomycin c was ineffective in generating non-bacteriocinogenic derivatives and had no impact on plasmid loss either. classification studies elucidated lactobacillus k7 as a member of the lactobacillus gasseri species.
the effect of orally administered viable probiotic and dairy lactobacilli on mouse lymphocyte proliferation.
four common lactobacillus strains were screened for their effects on proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. mice received perorally 10(9) viable bacteria kg(-1) body weight for 7 days. lactobacillus acidophilus treatment enhanced ex vivo basal proliferation (by 43%) and b-cell response at suboptimal and optimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (lps) (by 27-28%). conversely, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibited both basal proliferation (by 14-51%) and mitogen-stimulated lymphoproliferation, particularly at supra-optimal concentrations of concanavalin a (by 43-68%) and lps (by 23-62%). therefore, these lactobacillus strains demonstrate strain-specific effects on b- and t-cells and may also alter the splenocyte sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of mitogens.
gassericin a; an uncommon cyclic bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39 linked at n- and c-terminal ends.
gassericin a, a bacteriocin that was produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, was  treated with lysylendopeptidase and 3-bromo-3-methyl-2-(2-nitrophenyl-mercapto)-3h-indole. the fragments were recovered by sds-page and sequenced. all amino acids of gassericin a were distributed by sequence analysis and the bacteriocin did not contain any modified amino acids. the amino acid sequence of gassericin a completely coincided with that found through the cloning of the structural gene. gassericin a was shown to be a cyclic bacteriocin (class ii) which is bound at the n- and c-terminal ends. this is the first example of a cyclic bacteriocin from lactobacilli lactic acid bacteria.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
sequence analysis by cloning of the structural gene of gassericin a, a hydrophobic bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39.
gassericin a, a bacteriocin from lactobacillus gasseri la39, was purified to homogeneity from the culturesupernatant mainly by reverse-phase chromatography. the molecular weight of gassericin a was found to be 5,652 by mass analysis, unlike the estimated 3,800 found by sds-page. however, when the purified preparation was treated with lysylendopeptidase, it migrated as a single band to 5,600 with bacteriocin activity on sds-page. n- and c-terminal amino acids could not be identified. the internal amino acid could be identified after gassericin a was hydrolyzed with lysylendopeptidase. the dna of the structural gene of gassericin a was sequenced by cloning of the gene from chromosomal dna with an oligonucleotide probe. the structural gene of gassericin a was found on the chromosomal dna as an open reading frame encoding a protein composed of 91 amino acids. the amino acid sequence of mature gassericin a was predicted to be 58 residues from the dna sequence and results of mass analysis. these results suggested that gassericin a has a closed circular structure with n- and c-terminals linked. gassericin a is a hydrophobic class ii bacteriocin; it was 98% identical with acidocin b produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46.
isolation and partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus  gasseri jcm 2124.
four antibacterially active peptides (b1 to b4) were purified from the culture broth of l. gasseri jcm 2124. the b2 peptide (gassericin b2) was determined to be 4400 da by mass spectrometry and partially sequenced. gassericin b2 did not show any sequence similarities to other known bacteriocins. the b1 and b3 peptides shared identical sequences with two peptides of a two-component bacteriocin from lactobacillus acidophilus. however, synergistic activity upon complementation of b1 and b3 was not observed. based on amino acid sequencing and molecular mass, it is suggested that b1 and b4 peptides were derived from b3 (gassericin b3).
lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.
inhibition of food-borne pathogenic bacteria by bacteriocins from lactobacillus gasseri.
lactobacillus acidophilus group and a lact. reuteri isolated from human faeces were examined for production of antimicrobial agents against 16 strains of six species of food-borne enteric pathogenic bacteria. several strains of lact. gasseri showed wide inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria. gassericin a produced by lact. gasseri la39 was one of the most widely active bacteriocins. it was bactericidal without causing cell lysis.
