TI == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in spontaneously-fermented buckwheat and teff sourdoughs.
AB == in this study, four different laboratory scale gluten-free (gf) sourdoughs were developed from buckwheat or teff flours. the fermentations were initiated by the spontaneous biota of the flours and developed under two technological conditions (a and b). sourdoughs were propagated by continuous back-slopping until the stability was reached. the composition of the stable biota occurring in each sourdough was assessed using both culture-dependent and -independent techniques. overall, a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts species, belonging mainly to the genera lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, kazachstania and candida, were identified in the stable sourdoughs. buckwheat and teff sourdoughs were dominated mainly by obligate or facultative heterofermentative lab, which are commonly associated with traditional wheat or rye sourdoughs. however, the spontaneous fermentation of the gf flours resulted also in the selection of species which are not consider endemic to traditional sourdoughs, i.e. pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc holzapfelii, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus graminis and weissella cibaria. in general, the composition of the stable biota was strongly affected by the fermentation conditions, whilst lactobacillus plantarum dominated in all buckwheat sourdoughs. lactobacillus pontis is described for the first time as dominant species in teff sourdough. among yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida glabrata dominated teff sourdoughs, whereas the solely kazachstania barnetti was isolated in buckwheat sourdough developed under condition a. this study allowed the identification and isolation of lab and yeasts species which are highly competitive during fermentation of buckwheat or teff flours. representatives of these species can be selected as starters for the production of sourdough destined to gf bread production.

TI == analysis of vaginal lactic acid producing bacteria in healthy women.
AB == vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria of 80 pre-menopausal women were studied by isolation on blood and deman-rogosa-sharpe agar, pcr with group-specific primers for lactobacillus-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and pcr with specific primers for v3 region in 16s rrna-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge). conventional isolation method on media detected only one lactobacillus (lactobacillus brevis) while ttge detected only lactobacillus sp. dgge detected seven lactobacillus species; l. coleohominis, l. crispatus, l. iners, l. reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. vaginalis, and leuconostoc lactis. l. acidophilus and l. gasseri, which are prevalent in western women, were not detected in korean women. furthermore, l. rhamnosus, leuc. lactis, l. coleohominis, and weissella cibaria, which were not previously reported in the vaginal microbiota of korean women, were detected. the five most prevalent labs in vaginal microbiota in korean women were l. iners, enterococcus faecalis, l. crispatus, leuc. lactis, and w. cibaria.
