TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == characterization of a potential beta-lactamase inhibitory metabolite from a marine streptomyces sp. pm49 active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == actinobacteria is a prolific producer of complex natural products; we isolated a  potential marine streptomyces sp. pm49 strain from bay of bengal coastal area of  india. the strain pm49 exhibited highly efficient antibacterial properties on multidrug-resistant pathogens with a zone of inhibition of 14-17 mm. ssf was adopted for the production of the secondary metabolites from pm49 with isp2; utilizing agricultural wastes for compound extraction was also attempted. bioactive fraction of rf value 0.69 resolved using chloroform and ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) was obtained and subjected to further analysis. based on uv, ir, esi-ms, and (1)h and (13)c nmr spectral analysis, it was revealed that the compound is closely similar to cyslabdan with a molecular mass of 467.66 corresponding to the molecular formula c25h41no5s. esbl and mbl production was screened in the hospital test isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. pcr amplification in the phenotypically positive strains was positive for bla imp, bla shv, bla ctx-m, and mec genes. the beta-lactamase enzyme from tested strains had cephalosporinase activity with a 31-kda protein and isolated compound from the strain possessing beta-lactamase inhibitory potential. mic of the active fraction was 16-32 mug/ml  on atcc strains; the ceftazidime and meropenem sensitive and resistant test strains showed mic of 64-256 mug/ml. the streptomyces sp. pm49 aerial mycelium was rectiflexibile; the 16s rrna showed 99 % identity with streptomyces rochei and submitted at genbank with accession no jx904061.1.

TI  == dissemination of blaoxa-23 in acinetobacter spp. in china: main roles of conjugative plasmid pazj221 and transposon tn2009.
AB  == production of the oxa-23 carbapenemase is the most common reason for the increasing carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter spp. this study was conducted to reveal the genetic basis of blaoxa-23 dissemination in acinetobacter spp. in china. a total of 63 carbapenem-resistant oxa-23-producing acinetobacter sp. isolates, representing different backgrounds, were selected from 28 hospitals in  18 provinces for this study. generally, two patterns of plasmids carrying blaoxa-23 were detected according to s1-nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern blot hybridization. a ca. 78-kb plasmid, designated pazj221, was found in 23 acinetobacter baumannii and three acinetobacter nosocomialis isolates, while a novel ca. 50-kb plasmid was carried by only two other a. baumannii isolates. three of these isolates had an additional copy of blaoxa-23 on the chromosome. transformation of the two plasmids succeeded, but only pazj221 was conjugative. plasmid pazj221 was sequenced completely and found to carry no previously known resistance genes except blaoxa-23. the blaoxa-23 gene of the remaining 35 isolates was chromosome borne. the blaoxa-23 genetic environments were correlated with tn2009 in 57 isolates, tn2008 in 5 isolates, and tn2006 in 1 isolate. the mic values for the carbapenems with these isolates were not significantly associated with the genomic locations or the copy numbers of blaoxa-23. overall, these observations suggest that the plasmid pazj221 and tn2009 have effectively contributed to the wide dissemination of blaoxa-23 in acinetobacter spp. in china and that horizontal gene transfer may play an important role in dissemination of the blaoxa-23 gene.

TI  == acinetobacter seifertii sp. nov., a member of the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  == this study aimed to define the taxonomic status of a phenetically distinct group  of 16 strains that corresponds to acinetobacter genomic species 'close to 13tu',  a provisional genomic species of the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex recognized by gerner-smidt and tjernberg in 1993. these strains have been isolated in different countries since the early 1990s and were  mostly recovered from human clinical specimens. they were compared with 45 reference strains representing the known taxa of the acb complex using taxonomic  methods relevant to the genus acinetobacter. based on sequence analysis of the concatenated partial sequences (2976 bp) of seven housekeeping genes, the 16 strains formed a tight and well-supported cluster (intracluster sequence identity of >/=98.4 %) that was clearly separated from the other members of the acb complex (</=94.7 %). the species status of the group was supported by average nucleotide identity values of </=91.7 % between the whole genome sequence of representative strain niph 973(t) (ncbi accession no. apoo00000000) and those of  the other species. in addition, whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (maldi-tof) ms analyses indicated the distinctness of the group at the protein level. metabolic and physiological tests revealed several typical features of the group, although they did not allow its reliable differentiation from the other members of the acb complex. we conclude that the 16 strains represent a distinct novel species, for which we propose the name acinetobacter seifertii sp. nov. the type strain is niph 973(t) ( = cip 110471(t) = ccug 34785(t) = ccm 8535(t)).

TI  == a new double digestion ligation mediated suppression pcr method for simultaneous  bacteria dna-typing and confirmation of species: an acinetobacter sp. model.
AB  == we have designed a new ddlms pcr (double digestion ligation mediated suppression  pcr) method based on restriction site polymorphism upstream from the specific target sequence for the simultaneous identification and differentiation of bacterial strains. the ddlms pcr combines a simple pcr used for species or genus  identification and the lm pcr strategy for strain differentiation. the bacterial  identification is confirmed in the form of the pcr product(s), while the length of the pcr product makes it possible to differentiate between bacterial strains.  if there is a single copy of the target sequence within genomic dna, one specific pcr product is created (simplex ddlms pcr), whereas for multiple copies of the gene the fingerprinting patterns can be obtained (multiplex ddlms pcr). the described ddlms pcr method is designed for rapid and specific strain differentiation in medical and microbiological studies. in comparison to other lm pcr it has substantial advantages: enables specific species' dna-typing without the need for pure bacterial culture selection, is not sensitive to contamination  with other cells or genomic dna, and gives univocal "band-based" results, which are easy to interpret. the utility of ddlms pcr was shown for acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (acb) complex, the genetically closely related and phenotypically similar species and also important nosocomial pathogens, for which currently, there are no recommended methods for screening, typing and identification. in this article two models are proposed: 3' reca-ddlms pcr-maeii/rsai for acb complex interspecific typing and 5' rrn-ddlms pcr-hindiii/apai for acinetobacter baumannii intraspecific typing. ddlms pcr allows not only for dna-typing but also for confirmation of species in one reaction. also, practical guidelines for designing a diagnostic test based on ddlms pcr for genotyping different species of bacteria are provided.

TI  == the biological activities of cinnamon, geranium and lavender essential oils.
AB  == acinetobacter sp. represent an important cause of nosocomial infections. their resistance to some antibiotics, their ability to survive on inanimate surfaces in the hospital environment and their ability to produce biofilms contributes to their virulence. the aim of the study was to determine the antibacterial properties of cinnamon, lavender and geranium essential oils against bacteria of  the genus acinetobacter isolated from several clinical materials and from the hospital environment. a comprehensive evaluation of the susceptibility of acinetobacter sp. clinical strains to recommended antibiotics was performed. the  constituents of cinnamon, lavender and geranium essential oils were identified by gc-fid-ms analysis, and their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) against tested clinical strains were determined by the micro-dilution broth method. in addition, the effects of essential oils on the viability of human microvascular endothelial cells (hmec-1) and glioblastoma cell line (t98g) were evaluated. cinnamon bark oil was the most active against clinical and environmental strains  of acinetobacter baumannii with mic values ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 microl/ml. the mic values for geranium oil were between 7.5 and 9.5 microl/ml, and between 10.5  and 13.0 microl/ml for lavender oil. these essential oils can be best employed in the fight against infections caused by bacteria from acinetobacter genus as components of formulations for hygiene and disinfection of hospital environment.

TI  == production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  == in this paper, the production of humic substances (hs) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (lrc) was evaluated. the evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. the biotransformed lrc and the hs produced were quantified in vitro  in a liquid growth medium. the humic acids (ha) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (c, h, n, o), ir analyses, and the e4/e6 ratio; they were then compared with the ha extracted chemically using naoh. there was lrc biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and hs production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . l(-1). more activity was detected in the isolated strains of bacillus mycoides, microbacterium sp, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter aerogenes. the ha produced by b. mycoides had an ir spectrum and an e4/e6 ratio similar to those of the ha extracted with naoh, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the lrc resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce hs in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.

TI  == ecological competition and the incidence of acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in a teaching hospital in southeastern brazil.
AB  == introduction: recently, pathogen ecology has been recognized as an important epidemiological determinant of healthcare-associated infections (hais). acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important agents known to cause hais.  it is widespread in healthcare settings and exhibits seasonal variations in incidence. little is known about the impact of competition with other hospital pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii infection. methods: we conducted an ecological study, enrolling patients who presented with healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (ha-bsis) from 2005 to 2010 at a 450-bed teaching hospital in brazil. ha-bsis were said to be present when bacteria or fungi were recovered  from blood cultures collected at least three days after admission. monthly incidence rates were calculated for all ha-bsis (overall or caused by specific pathogens or groups of pathogens). multivariate poisson regression models were used to identify the impacts of the incidence of several pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii. results: the overall incidence rate of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was 2.5 per 10,000 patient-days. in the multivariate analysis, the incidence of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was negatively associated with the incidence rates of ha-bsi due to staphylococcus aureus (rate ratio [rr]=0.88; 95% confidence interval [ci]=0.80-0.97), enterobacter spp. (rr=0.84; 95%ci=0.74-0.94) and a pool of less common gram-negative pathogens. conclusions: our results suggest that competition between pathogens influences the etiology of ha-bsis. it would be beneficial to take these findings into account in infection control policies.

TI  == in vitro activity of potential old and new drugs against multidrug-resistant gram-negatives.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of  mdr gram-negatives bacteria to old drugs such as polymyxin b, minocycline and fosfomycin and new drugs such as tigecycline. methods: one hundred and fifty-three isolates from 4 brazilian hospitals were evaluated. forty-seven acinetobacter baumannii resistant to carbapenens harboring adeb, blaoxa23, blaoxa51, blaoxa143 and blaimp genes, 48 stenotrophomonas maltophilia including isolates resistant to levofloxacin and/or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole harboring sul-1, sul-2 and qnrmr and 8 serratia marcescens and 50 klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to carbapenens harboring blakpc-2 were tested to determine their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) by microdilution to the following drugs: minocycline, ampicillin-sulbactam, tigecycline, and polymyxin b and by agar dilution to fosfomycin according with breakpoint criteria of clsi and eucast (fosfomycin). in addition, eucast fosfomycin breakpoint for pseudomonas spp. was  applied for acinetobacter spp and s. maltophilia, the fda criteria for tigecycline was used for acinetobacter spp and s. maltophilia and the pseudomonas spp polymyxin b clsi criterion was used for s. maltophilia. results: tigecycline  showed the best in vitro activity against the mdr gram-negative evaluated, followed by polymyxin b and fosfomycin. polymyxin b resistance among k. pneumoniae was detected in 6 isolates, using the breakpoint of mic > 8 ug/ml. two of these isolates were resistant to tigecycline. minocycline was tested only against s. maltophilia and a. baumannii and showed excellent activity against both. conclusions: fosfomycin seems to not be an option to treat infections due to the a. baumannii and s. maltophilia isolates according with eucast breakpoint, on the other hand, showed excellent activity against s. marcescens and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == exploration of three heterotrophic nitrifying strains from a tilapia pond for their characteristics of inorganic nitrogen use and application in aquaculture water.
AB  == three heterotrophic nitrifying bacterial strains, hlf01, hbf01 and hhf01, were isolated from a pond where genetically improved farmed tilapia (gift) (oreochromis niloticus) was intensively cultured during the annual peak breeding  period. analysis of biochemical, morphological characteristics and sequences analysis of 16s rdna identified strains hlf01 and hbf01 as pseudomonas sp., and strain hhf01 as acinetobacter baumannii. further analysis of heterotrophic nitrifying medium inorganic nitrogen used showed that most of the ammonia nitrogen was removed after 48 h. strains hbf01 and hhf01 removed 67.9% and 76.7%  of the total ammonia nitrogen after 24 h, recording the mass ratio of carbon to nitrogen used as 10.6 to 1 and 11.7 to 1, respectively. strain hlf01 used a c:n ratio of 22.7 to 1 with a total of 43.8% ammonia nitrogen removed. in denitrifying media, strains hbf01 and hhf01 may have used nitrate and nitrite as  the sole nitrogen source by strain hlf01. generally, all the three strains used nitrogen in the order ammonia > nitrite > nitrate when all the three nitrogen forms were recorded present. although the bacterial strains consumed dissolved organic carbon, it was limited when ammonia was the main source of nitrogen compared with other forms of inorganic nitrogen. also, the test of the three strains on aquaculture water showed similar results of efficiency of ammonia nitrogen removal with the test of inorganic nitrogen use.

TI  == crystal structure of peptidyl-trna hydrolase from a gram-positive bacterium, streptococcus pyogenes at 2.19 a resolution shows the closed structure of the substrate-binding cleft.
AB  == peptidyl-trna hydrolase (pth) catalyses the release of trna and peptide components from peptidyl-trna molecules. pth from a gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes (sppth) was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallised.  three-dimensional structure of sppth was determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.19 a resolution. structure determination showed that the asymmetric unit of the unit cell contained two crystallographically independent molecules, designated a  and b. the superimposition of c(alpha) traces of molecules a and b showed an r.m.s. shift of 0.4 a, indicating that the structures of two crystallographically independent molecules were identical. the polypeptide chain of sppth adopted an overall alpha/beta conformation. the substrate-binding cleft in sppth is formed with three loops: the gate loop, ile91-leu102; the base loop, gly108-gly115; and  the lid loop, gly136-gly150. unlike in the structures of pth from gram-negative bacteria, the entry to the cleft in the structure of sppth appeared to be virtually closed. however, the conformations of the active site residues were found to be similar.

TI  == early dissemination of oxa-72-producing acinetobacter baumannii strain in colombia: a case report.
AB  == nosocomial infections caused by carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii isolates have reached epidemic levels in past decades. currently this microorganism is responsible for outbreaks of difficult eradication and with high mortality rates worldwide. we herein report a rare case of an oxa-72-producing a. baumannii isolate colonizing a 47-year-old male patient with peritonitis due to abdominal stab wound, four years earlier than the first report of this carbapenemase in acinetobacter pittii in colombia. although oxa-72 presents a low prevalence compared with oxa-23, our study demonstrated that a. baumannii isolates carrying the blaoxa-72 gene were present in the hospital environment in  colombia and could act as a reservoir for further spread to other acinetobacter species, like a. pittii, causing carbapenem-resistance.

TI  == microstructure, microbial profile and quality characteristics of high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets.
AB  == high-pressure processing (300 mpa for 5 min) as a non-thermal post-processing intervention was employed to improve the shelf life and qualities of cooked refrigerated chicken nuggets. pomegranate peel extract (1%) was also used as a source of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial in chicken nuggets. microstructure, microbial profile, instrumental colour, texture profile and lipid oxidation were evaluated. high-pressure treatment and pomegranate peel extract did not influence significantly the colour and textural properties of cooked chicken nuggets. thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values significantly (p < 0.05) increased in pressure-treated nuggets. microstructural studies revealed shrinkage in the structure and loosening of the dense network of meat emulsion due to high-pressure treatment. pressure treatment resulted in a reduction of 2-3.0 log10 cfu/g in total plate count and enterobacteriaceae count. molecular characterization studies revealed that enterobacter amnigenus and enterobacter sp. in control and bacillus licheniformis, enterococcus gallinarum and acinetobacter baumannii in high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets were the major spoilage bacteria.

TI  == detection of airborne bacteria in a duck production facility with two different personal air sampling devices for an exposure assessment.
AB  == prevalent airborne microorganisms are not well characterized in industrial animal production buildings with respect to their quantity or quality. to investigate the work-related microbial exposure, personal bioaerosol sampling during the whole working day is recommended. therefore, bioaerosol sampling in a duck hatchery and a duck house with two personal air sampling devices, a filter-based  pgp and a niosh particle size separator, was performed. subsequent, quantitative  and qualitative analyses were carried out with" culture independent methods. total cell concentrations (tcc) determined via fluorescence microscopy showed no  difference between the two devices. in average, 8 x 10(6) cells/m(3) were determined in the air of the duck hatchery and 5 x 10(7) cells/m(3) in the air of the duck house. a generated restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) pattern revealed deviant bacterial compositions comparing samples collected with  both devices. clone library analyses based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis from the hatchery's air showed 65% similarity between the two sampling devices. detailed 16s rrna gene sequence analyses showed the occurrence of bacterial species like acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia sp., and shigella sp.; and a group of staphylococcus delphini, s. intermedius, and s. pseudintermedius that provided the evidence of potential exposure to risk group 2 bacteria at the hatchery workplace. size fractionated sampling with the developed by the institute for occupational safety and health of the german social accident insurance (ifa) device revealed that pathogenic bacteria would deposit in the inhalable, the thorax, and possibly alveolar dust fraction according to en481. tcc analysis showed the deposition of bacterial cells in the third stage (< 1mum) at the niosh device which implies that bacteria can reach deep into the lungs and contaminate the alveolus after inhalation. nevertheless, both personal sampling devices could be recommended for exposure assessment at agricultural workplaces.

TI  == optimized polymeric film-based nitric oxide delivery inhibits bacterial growth in a mouse burn wound model.
AB  == nitric oxide (no) has many biological roles (e.g. antimicrobial agent, promoter of angiogenesis, prevention of platelet activation) that make no releasing materials desirable for a variety of biomedical applications. localized no release can be achieved from biomedical grade polymers doped with diazeniumdiolated dibutylhexanediamine (dbhd/n2o2) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (plga). in this study, the optimization of this chemistry to create film/patches that can be used to decrease microbial infection at wound sites is examined. two polyurethanes with different water uptakes (tecoflex sg-80a (6.2+/-0.7wt.%) and tecophilic sp-60d-20 (22.5+/-1.1wt.%)) were doped with 25wt.% dbhd/n2o2 and 10wt.% of plga with various hydrolysis rates. films prepared with the polymer that has the higher water uptake (sp-60d-20) were found to have higher no release and for a longer duration than the polyurethane with the lower  water uptake (sg-80a). the more hydrophilic polymer enhances the hydrolysis rate  of the plga additive, thereby providing a more acidic environment that increases  the rate of no release from the no donor. the optimal no releasing and control sg-80a patches were then applied to scald burn wounds that were infected with acinetobacter baumannii. the no released from these patches applied to the wounds is shown to significantly reduce the a. baumannii infection after 24h ( approximately 4 log reduction). the no release patches are also able to reduce the level of transforming growth factor-beta in comparison to controls, which can enhance re-epithelialization, decrease scarring and reduce migration of bacteria. the combined dbhd/n2o2 and plga-doped polymer patches, which could be replaced periodically throughout the wound healing process, demonstrate the potential to reduce risk of bacterial infection and promote the overall wound healing process.

TI  == [news of antibiotic resistance among gram-negative bacilli in algeria].
AB  == antibiotic resistance has become a major public health problem in algeria. indeed the past decade, we have seen a significant increase in resistance to antibiotics especially in gram-negative bacilli. resistance to beta-lactams in enterobacteria is dominated by the production of esbl ctx-m-3 and ctx-m-15. the strains producing these enzymes are often the cause of potentially serious infections in  both hospital and community settings. identified plasmid cephalosporinases are cmy-2, cmy-12 and dha-1. the isolation of strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa producing carbapenemases is rare in algeria. some enterobacteriaceae producing oxa-48 or vim-19 have been reported; so far, only vim-2 has been identified in p. aeruginosa. however, the situation regarding the  strains of acinetobacter baumannii resistant to carbapenemases seems to be more disturbing. the carbapenemase oxa-23 is the most common and seems to be endemic in the north. the carbapenemase ndm-1 has also been identified. resistance to aminoglycosides is marked by the identification arma gene associated with blactx-m genes in strains of salmonella sp. several other resistance genes have been identified sporadically in strains of enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and  a. baumannii. resistance genes to fluoroquinolones are more recent identification in algeria. the most common are the qnr determinants followed by the bifunctional enzyme aac[6']-ib-cr. resistance to sulfonamides and trimethoprim was also reported in enterobacteriaceae strains in the west of the country.

TI  == detection of carbapenemase activity directly from blood culture vials using maldi-tof ms: a quick answer for the right decision.
AB  == objectives: recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight  mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) was successfully applied for the detection of carbapenemase activity directly from gram-negative colonies. based on this principle, we evaluated the performance of maldi-tof ms for rapid detection of carbapenemase activity directly from positive blood culture vials. methods: a total of 100 blood culture vials were randomly selected. maldi-tof ms carbapenemase assay results were confirmed by the detection of carbapenemase-encoding genes. results: a total of 110 bacterial isolates were recovered. the maldi-tof ms carbapenemase assay identified 21 of 29 (72.4%) of the carbapenemase-producing isolates directly from the blood culture vials, especially those encoding kpc-2 (100%) and spm-1 (100%), after a 4 h incubation period. although the majority of oxa-23-producing acinetobacter baumannii isolates were not identified on day 1, all isolates were identified as carbapenemase producers directly from the colony on the next day. conclusions: the maldi-tof ms carbapenemase assay is a feasible and rapid test to identify carbapenemase activity directly from blood culture vials. it may contribute to faster readjustment of empirical antimicrobial therapy and implementation of infection control measures.

TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

TI  == [evaluation of selected properties of morphological variants of acinetobacter baumannii complex].
AB  == introduction: the ability of growth of acinetobacter baumannii as morphology colony variants have been observed. however, the importance of this phenomenon for its biology is not known. the aim of this study was to evaluate some properties of light and dark morphology colony variants. methods: fifty two isolates were identified by maldi tof ms method (maldi biotyper, bruker). it was  evaluated the adhesion to polystyrene and extracellular mucus production of morphology colony variants and its susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem by agar dilution method. results: forty eight (92.3%) out of the 52 morphotypes acinetobacter sp. were identified as a. baumannii, two (5.8%) as a. genomospecies 3, one as the a. calcoaceticus. sixteen (61.0%) pairs of isolates showed differences in the similarity of the spectra to the spectra of reference strains  in the maldi-tof ms method. adhesion to polystyrene was observed in all dark and  92.3% light morphotypes. extracellular slime was produced by 15 (57.7%) dark morphotypes, and 7 (26.9%) of clear. the differences in susceptibility to imipenem occurred in two (7.7%), and meropenem in three (11.5%) pairs of morphotypes. conclusions: the results show diversity of biological properties of  morphology colony variants of a. baumannii complex. differences in the level of adhesion to polystyrene and slime production may indicate the importance of morphological differentiation in virulence of a. baumannii complex.

TI  == trauma is associated with a better prognosis in intensive care patients with acinetobacter infections.
AB  == purpose: acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a common cause of infection in war-related trauma, civilian trauma and other surgical emergencies. the aim of this study was to determine prognostic factors especially trauma, in critically ill surgical patients with acinetobacter spp. infection in a reference emergency  icu. methods: a retrospective review of medical records was conducted for all patients admitted to the icu who developed acinetobacter spp. infection from january 2007 to december 2009. bivariate and multivariate analyses were made for  36 patients. the end-point analyzed was the in-hospital mortality. results: the initial analysis revealed a majority of young (43.6 years +/- 17.1) men (92 %), trauma victims (78 %) and an in-hospital mortality of 30 %. patients who had not  suffered trauma presented with other surgical conditions and were on average older than trauma patients (57 +/- 12 versus 40 +/- 16 years). the overall apache ii score average was 15.3. the ventilator-associated pneumonia was the main acinetobacter infection diagnosed. in bivariate analysis lower glasgow coma scale (p = 0.01) was associated with increased chance of death and being victim of trauma was a protecting factor (or: 0.16; 95 % ci: 0.03-0.89). receiving adequate treatment made no difference to outcome (or: 0.55; 95 % ci: 0.05-3.15). multivariate analysis showed that only the presence of trauma was independently associated with prognosis and was a protecting factor. conclusion: trauma was a marker of good prognosis in emergency icu patients with acinetobacter spp. infection.

TI  == colistin bladder instillation, an alternative way of treating multi-resistant acinetobacter urinary tract infection: a case series and review of literature.
AB  == the multiresistant acinetobacter species bacteria are frequently involved in urinary or respiratory tract infections, and one of the most effective drugs, colistine, is associated with significant nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. given that very high concentrations of colistine into biological fluids are safe for the human organism, attempts have been made at delivering the drug topically, by  aerosol, or, occasionally, intratechally or intraventricularly for meningitis. these topical treatments could eradicate the pseudomonas sp. from the lung of patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis and the acinetobacter baumannii from lung and meninges. however, only one case of colistin topic treatment in urinary tract infection is described. we report a case series of three patients successfully undergone colistin bladder instillations for multi drug resistant acinetobacter urinary tract infection, and we review the literature about colistin topic treatment.

TI  == coral-associated bacteria, quorum sensing disrupters, and the regulation of biofouling.
AB  == marine biofouling, the settlement of microorganisms and macroorganisms on structures submerged in seawater, although economically detrimental, is a successful strategy for survival in hostile environments, where coordinated bacterial communities establish biofilms via the regulation of quorum sensing (qs) communication systems. the inhibition of qs activity among bacteria isolated from different coral species was investigated to gain further insight into its potency in the attenuation, or even the prevention, of undesirable biofouling on  marine organisms. it is hypothesized that coral mucus/microorganism interactions  are competitive, suggesting that the dominant communities secrete qs disruptive compounds. one hundred and twenty bacterial isolates were collected from healthy  coral species and screened for their ability to inhibit qs using three bioreporter strains. approximately 12, 11, and 24% of the isolates exhibited anti-qs activity against escherichia coli psb1075, chromobacterium violaceum cv026, and agrobacterium tumefaciens kyc55 indicator strains, respectively. isolates with positive activity against the bioluminescent monitor strains were scanned via a cytotoxic/genotoxic, e. coli tv1061 and dpd2794 antimicrobial panel. isolates detected by c. violaceum cv026 and a. tumefaciens kyc55 reporter  strains were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of these reporter strains, which were found to be unaffected. tests of the favia sp. coral isolate  fav 2-50-7 (>98% similarity to vibrio harveyi) for its ability to attenuate the formation of biofilm showed extensive inhibitory activity against biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. to ascertain the stability and general structure of the active compound, cell-free culture supernatants exposed to an increasing temperature gradient or to digestion by proteinase k, were shown to maintain potent qs attenuation and the ability to inhibit the growth of biofilms. mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of a low molecular mass compound. the anti-qs strategy exemplified in the coral mucus is a model with potentially wide applications, including countering the ecological threat posed by biofilms. manipulating synchronized bacterial behavior by detecting new  qs inhibitors will facilitate the discovery of new antifouling compounds.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == variation in the complex carbohydrate biosynthesis loci of acinetobacter baumannii genomes.
AB  == extracellular polysaccharides are major immunogenic components of the bacterial cell envelope. however, little is known about their biosynthesis in the genus acinetobacter, which includes a. baumannii, an important nosocomial pathogen. whether acinetobacter sp. produce a capsule or a lipopolysaccharide carrying an o antigen or both is not resolved. to explore these issues, genes involved in the synthesis of complex polysaccharides were located in 10 complete a. baumannii genome sequences, and the function of each of their products was predicted via comparison to enzymes with a known function. the absence of a gene encoding a waal ligase, required to link the carbohydrate polymer to the lipid a-core oligosaccharide (lipooligosaccharide) forming lipopolysaccharide, suggests that only a capsule is produced. nine distinct arrangements of a large capsule biosynthesis locus, designated kl1 to kl9, were found in the genomes. three forms of a second, smaller variable locus, likely to be required for synthesis of the outer core of the lipid a-core moiety, were designated ocl1 to ocl3 and also annotated. each k locus includes genes for capsule export as well as genes for synthesis of activated sugar precursors, and for glycosyltransfer, glycan modification and oligosaccharide repeat-unit processing. the k loci all include the export genes at one end and genes for synthesis of common sugar precursors at the other, with a highly variable region that includes the remaining genes in between. five different capsule loci, kl2, kl6, kl7, kl8 and kl9 were detected in multiply antibiotic resistant isolates belonging to global clone 2, and two other loci, kl1 and kl4, in global clone 1. this indicates that this region is being substituted repeatedly in multiply antibiotic resistant isolates from these clones.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  == in this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (vb) and through cesarean section (cb) were investigated using culture-independent 16s rdna cloning and sequencing approach. the results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of vb infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart cb infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants  delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. the most abundant bacterial species present in vb infants were acinetobacter sp., bifidobacterium sp. and staphylococcus sp. however, cb infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with citrobacter sp., escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. the intestinal  microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of bifidobacteria species. an interesting finding of  our study was recovery of large number of acinetobacter sp. consisting of acinetobacter pittii (former acinetobacter genomic species 3), acinetobacter junii and acinetobacter baumannii in the vb infants clone library. among these, acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.

AB  == background: infections by a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii (acb) complex isolates represent a serious threat for wounded and burn patients. three international multidrug-resistant (mdr) clones (eu clone i-iii) are responsible for a large proportion of nosocomial infections with a. baumannii but other emerging strains  with high epidemic potential also occur. methodology/principal findings: we automatized a multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats (vntr) analysis (mlva) protocol and used it to investigate the genetic diversity of 136 acb isolates from four military hospitals and one childrens hospital. acinetobacter sp other than baumannii isolates represented 22.6% (31/137) with a majority being a. pittii. the genotyping protocol designed for a.baumannii was also efficient to cluster a. pittii isolates. fifty-five percent of a. baumannii isolates belonged  to the two international clones i and ii, and we identified new clones which members were found in the different hospitals. analysis of two crispr-cas systems helped define two clonal complexes and provided phylogenetic information to help  trace back their emergence. conclusions/significance: the increasing occurrence of a. baumannii infections in the hospital calls for measures to rapidly characterize the isolates and identify emerging clones. the automatized mlva protocol can be the instrument for such surveys. in addition, the investigation of crispr/cas systems may give important keys to understand the evolution of some highly successful clonal complexes.

TI  == in vivo-validated essential genes identified in acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  == a critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. for bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media.  this study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. a subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. the putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, dna/rna synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. these a. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the database of essential genes (deg), including those of acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. however, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. none of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of fda-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. importance: the  human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and  a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. this scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective  against antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli. this study identified a set of a. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the database of essential genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria has been identified.

TI  == early insights into the interactions of different beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors against soluble forms of acinetobacter baumannii pbp1a  and acinetobacter sp. pbp3.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is an increasingly problematic pathogen in united states  hospitals. antibiotics that can treat a. baumannii are becoming more limited. little is known about the contributions of penicillin binding proteins (pbps), the target of beta-lactam antibiotics, to beta-lactam-sulbactam susceptibility and beta-lactam resistance in a. baumannii. decreased expression of pbps as well  as loss of binding of beta-lactams to pbps was previously shown to promote beta-lactam resistance in a. baumannii. using an in vitro assay with a reporter beta-lactam, bocillin, we determined that the 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic(50)s) for pbp1a from a. baumannii and pbp3 from acinetobacter sp. ranged from 1 to 5 mum for a series of beta-lactams. in contrast, pbp3 demonstrated a narrower range of ic(50)s against beta-lactamase inhibitors than pbp1a (ranges, 4 to 5 versus 8 to 144 mum, respectively). a molecular model with ampicillin and sulbactam positioned in the active site of pbp3 reveals that both compounds interact similarly with residues thr526, thr528, and ser390. accepting that many  interactions with cell wall targets are possible with the ampicillin-sulbactam combination, the low ic(50)s of ampicillin and sulbactam for pbp3 may contribute  to understanding why this combination is effective against a. baumannii. unraveling the contribution of pbps to beta-lactam susceptibility and resistance  brings us one step closer to identifying which pbps are the best targets for novel beta-lactams.

'close to 13tu' as a. calcoaceticus-baumannii complex. three acinetobacter species isolates were identified as novel species candidates. three acinetobacter species isolates were resistant to imipenem: 1 a. parvus and 2 novel species candidates of acinetobacter. eight isolates showed resistance to colistin: all acinetobacter gen. sp. 'close to 13tu' (2 isolates) and a. parvus isolates (3 isolates) were resistant to colistin. although the genotypes of a. baumannii isolates from various natural environments were different from those of clinical isolates, the presence of clinically important and antimicrobial resistant acinetobacter species in the natural environment may  represent a threat to public health.

AB  == a temperate phage, psymv2, was isolated from an antarctic soil bacterium, psychrobacter sp. mv2. the morphology of psymv2 was typical of the siphoviridae,  with an isometric head and non-contractile tail. the psymv2 genome was found to be 35,725 bp in length, had a g + c content of 44.5 %, with 49 protein-coding genes and one trna gene predicted. integration of psymv2 occurred at an ssra gene, with the last 27 bases of this gene directly repeated at the prophage ends. the genome was organised in a modular fashion: integration, regulation, packaging, head assembly, tail assembly, host specificity and lysis. while the genome sequence had little similarity on a nucleotide level to previously reported phage sequences, the genome architecture resembled that of siphoviridae  of low g + c gram-positive bacteria. the closest relatives to psymv2 were uncharacterized putative prophages within the p. arcticus 273-4 and acinetobacter baumannii 6013113 genomes. global alignment of the psymv2 genome and these prophages revealed significant conservation of the structural modules despite the large spatial divergence of their hosts. a number of unique orfs were identified  in the psymv2 genome that may contribute to phage and lysogen fitness.

AB  == catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (c12o) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from  acinetobacter sp. ds002. the pure enzyme appears to be a homodimer with a molecular mass of 66 kda. the apparent k(m) and v(max) for intradiol cleavage of  catechol were 1.58 mum and 2 units per mg of protein respectively. unlike other c12os reported in the literature, the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase of acinetobacter showed neither intradiol nor extradiol cleavage activity when substituted catechols were used as substrates. however, it has shown mild intradiol cleavage  activity when benzenetriol was used as substrate. as determined by two dimensional electrophoresis (2de) followed maldi-tof/tof analyses and gel permeation chromatography, no isoforms of c12o was observed in acinetobacter sp.  ds002. further, the c12o was seen only in cultures grown in benzoate and it was completely absent in succinate grown cultures. based on the sequence information  obtained from ms/ms data, degenerate primers were designed to amplify cata gene from the genomic dna of acinetobacter sp. ds002. the sequence of the pcr amplicon and deduced amino acid sequence showed 97% similarity with a cata gene of acinetobacter baumannii aye (yp_001713609).

TI  == thai ethnomedicinal plants as resistant modifying agents for combating acinetobacter baumannii infections.
AB  == background: acinetobacter baumannii is well-recognized as an important nosocomial pathogen, however, due to their intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics, treatment options are limited. synergistic effects between antibiotics and medicinal plants, particularly their active components, have intensively been studied as alternative approaches. methods: fifty-one ethanol extracts obtained from 44 different selected medicinal plant species were tested for resistance modifying agents (rmas) of novobiocin against a. baumannii using growth inhibition assay. results: at 250 mug/ml, holarrhena antidysenterica, punica granatum, quisqualis indica, terminalia bellirica, terminalia chebula, and terminalia sp. that possessed low intrinsic antibacterial activity significantly  enhanced the activity of novobiocin at 1 mug/ml (1/8xminimum inhibitory concentration) against this pathogen. holarrhena antidysenterica at 7.8 mug/ml demonstrated remarkable resistant modifying ability against a. baumannii in combination with novobiocin. the phytochemical study revealed that constituents of this medicinal plant contain alkaloids, condensed tannins, and triterpenoids.  conclusion: the use of holarrhena antidysenterica in combination with novobiocin  provides an effective alternative treatment for multidrug resistant a. baumannii  infections.

TI  == gram-negative osteomyelitis: clinical and microbiological profile.
AB  == introduction: despite the growing interest in the study of gram-negative bacilli  (gnb) infections, very little information on osteomyelitis caused by gnb is available in the medical literature. objectives and methods: to assess clinical and microbiological features of 101 cases of osteomyelitis caused by gnb alone, between january 2007 and january 2009, in a reference center for the treatment of high complexity traumas in the city of sao paulo. results: most patients were men (63%), with median age of 42 years, affected by chronic osteomyelitis (43%) or acute osteomyelitis associated to open fractures (32%), the majority on the lower limbs (71%). the patients were treated with antibiotics as inpatients for 40 days (median) and for 99 days (median) in outpatient settings. after 6 months follow-up, the clinical remission rate was around 60%, relapse 19%, amputation 7%, and death 5%. nine percent of cases were lost to follow-up. a total of 121 gnb was isolated from 101 clinical samples. the most frequently isolated pathogens were enterobacter sp. (25%), acinetobacter baumannii (21%) e pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). susceptibility to carbapenems was about 100% for enterobacter sp., 75% for pseudomonas aeruginosa and 60% for acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: osteomyelitis caused by gnb remains a serious therapeutic  challenge, especially when associated to nonfermenting bacteria. we emphasize the need to consider these agents in diagnosed cases of osteomyelitis, so that an ideal antimicrobial treatment can be administered since the very beginning of the therapy.

TI  == molecular characterization of clinical multiresistant isolates of acinetobacter sp. from hospitals in porto alegre, state of rio grande do sul, brazil.
AB  == introduction: hospitals around the world have presented multiresistant acinetobacter sp. outbreaks. the spread of these isolates that harbor an increasing variety of resistance genes makes the treatment of these infections and their control within the hospital environment more difficult. this study aimed to evaluate the occurrence and dissemination of acinetobacter sp. multiresistant isolates and to identify acquired resistance genes. methods: we analyzed 274 clinical isolates of acinetobacter sp. from five hospitals in porto  alegre, rs, brazil. we evaluated the susceptibility to antimicrobial, acquired resistance genes from ambler's classes b and d, and performed molecular typing of the isolates using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (eric-pcr) technique. results: a high (68%) percentage of multiresistant isolates of acinetobacter sp. was observed, and 69% were resistant to carbapenems. we identified 84% of isolates belonging to species a. baumannii because they presented the gene blaoxa-51. the gene blaoxa-23 was detected in 62% of the isolates, and among these, 98% were resistant to carbapenems. using the eric-pcr technique, we identified clones of acinetobacter sp. spread among the four hospitals analyzed during the sampling period. conclusions: the data indicate the dissemination of acinetobacter sp. isolates among hospitals and their permanence in the hospital after one year.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in isolated bacteria  from seawater of algiers beaches (algeria).
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate bacterial antibiotic resistance in seawater  from four beaches in algiers. the most significant resistance rates were observed for amoxicillin and ticarcillin, whereas they were relatively low for ceftazidime, cefotaxime and imipenem. according to sampling sites, the highest resistance rates were recorded for 2 sites subjected to chemical and microbiological inputs (amoxicillin, 43% and 52%; ticarcillin, 19.6% and 47.7%),  and for 2 sites relatively preserved from anthropogenic influence, resistance rates were lowest (amoxicillin, 1.5% and 16%; ticarcillin, 0.8% and 2.6%). thirty-four bacteria resistant to imipenem (n=14) or cefotaxime (n=20) were identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=15), pseudomonas fluorescens (7), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), burkholderia cepacia (2), bordetella sp. (1), pantoea sp. (1), acinetobacter baumannii (1), chryseomonas luteola (1), ochrobactrum anthropi (1) and escherichia coli (1). screening for extended spectrum beta-lactamase showed the presence of ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase in the e.  coli isolate, and the encoding gene was transferable in association with the inci1 plasmid of about 50 kbp. insertion sequence isecp1b was located upstream of the ctx-m-15 gene. this work showed a significant level of resistance to antibiotics, mainly among environmental saprophytic bacteria. transmissible ctx-m-15 was detected in e. coli; this may mean that contamination of the environment by resistant bacteria may cause the spread of resistance genes.

TI  == [review of the effectiveness of an empirical antibiotic therapy in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia].
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) occurs in approximately 10-20%  of mechanically ventilated patients, and is associated with an extremely high mortality rate (up to 70%). the purpose of the study was to determine the susceptibility spectrum of klebsiella, pseudomonas and acinetobacter strains isolated from vap patients. methods: we analysed 81 strains of microorganisms isolated from bronchoalveolar lavages (bal) of vap patients. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of antibiotics recommended for empirical therapy  were determined using an automated vitek 2 system, and for the mic of doripenem - the etest assay. results were analysed following the guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. results: for infections caused by the group of bacteria under investigation, the most successful regimen was monotherapy with carbapenems (doripenem, meropenem and imipenem). cephalosporins (cefepim and ceftazidim) were less effective in vitro. the worst results were obtained with the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam with aminoglycosides (amikacin or gentamicin) or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). conclusions: antibiotic monotherapy proved to be more effective in vap patients than combined therapy; the best results were achieved with carbapenems. doripenem showed strong activity in vitro against p. aeruginosa and klebsiella sp. and should be considered for empirical vap therapy; however, carbapenems may be less effective against acinetobacter baumannii. the wide range of bacteria, and their broad range of susceptibility to antibiotics, suggests the need for modification of current recommendations.

TI  == association of the genus acinetobacter with the decomposition of a swine carcass  and the isolation and characterization of a novel strain of acinetobacter sp. p4.
AB  == using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and a selective and differential  medium, acinetobacter numbers were enumerated over the time course of decomposition, from fresh to putrid/dry, of a swine carcass. in addition, acinetobacter diversity and succession were also characterized. acinetobacter bacterial counts were observed to be the lowest before exposure (undetectable) and increased to their highest during active decay then decreased and leveled during advanced decay through putrid/dry. fish analysis revealed acinetobacter cells were mostly clustered together, which is consistent with growth in a non-mixed environment, such as soil. the abundance of acinetobacter cells decreased from active decomposition to putrid/dry. blast analysis using the 16s rrna-gene sequence identified the isolates as one of the following acinetobacter  spp: a. baumannii, a. haemolyticus, a. junii, a. johnsonii, and a. gerneri. phenotypic description of the identified isolates closely matched those of known  genomic species. one isolate, p4, was observed to be unique in its phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics and was more closely related to a. sp e10. the isolates from this study displayed multi-antibiotic resistance. the results from  the study revealed the association of acinetobacter spp. with that of carrion which adds to our knowledge of the ecology of this genus along with the potential implications of infection for this opportunistic pathogen.

TI  == antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  == resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. tigecycline (tygacil, wyeth) is a relatively new fda and emea approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. in this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. in overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/l, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean mic values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/l, respectively). mic50 and mic90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/l for e. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/l for klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/l for various enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/l for pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/l for  acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l for serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/l for streptococcus sp. the mic values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for acinetobacter sp. (included a. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for klebsiella, serratia and enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular characterization of acinetobacter clinical isolates obtained from inmates of california correctional facilities.
AB  == acinetobacter spp. increasingly have been wreaking havoc in hospitals and communities worldwide. although much has been reported regarding acinetobacter isolates responsible for nosocomial infections, little is known about these organisms in correctional facilities. in this study, we performed species identification, examined the antibiotic resistance profiles, and determined the mechanisms of resistance and clonal relationships of 123 acinetobacter isolates obtained from inmates of 20 california correctional facilities (ccfs). we found that 57.7% of the isolates belong to a. baumannii, followed by isolates of acinetobacter genomic species 3 (gen. sp. 3; 23.6%) and of acinetobacter gen. sp. 13tu (10.6%). multidrug-resistant (mdr) ccf isolates were found in only six ccfs. additionally, dna sequences of gyra and parc genes were consistent with fluoroquinolone (fq) susceptibility phenotypes. furthermore, the presence of class 1 integrons was detected in 15 ccf isolates, all of which are mdr. integron-associated gene cassettes encode several aminoglycoside modification enzymes, which correlate with most of the aminoglycoside-resistant phenotypes. antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the presence of phe-arg-beta-naphthylamide dihydrochloride and 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine indicated the involvement of efflux pumps in the fq resistance of only a few ccf  isolates. finally, genetic profiling showed that there was no evidence of a. baumannii outbreaks in ccfs. instead, our analyses revealed only limited clonal dissemination of mostly non-mdr a. baumannii strains in a few facilities. this study represents the first report to characterize phenotypic and molecular features of acinetobacter isolates in correctional facilities, which provides a baseline for monitoring the antimicrobial resistance changes and dissemination patterns of these organisms in such specialized institutions.

TI  == acinetobacter oleivorans sp. nov. is capable of adhering to and growing on diesel-oil.
AB  == a diesel-oil and n-hexadecane-degrading novel bacterial strain, designated dr1(t), was isolated from a rice paddy in deok-so, south korea. the strain dr1(t) cells were gram-negative, aerobic coccobacilli, and grew at 20-37 degrees c with  the optimal temperature of 30 degrees c, and an optimal ph of 6-8. interestingly, strain dr1(t) was highly motile (swimming and swarming motility) using its fimbriae, and generated n-acyl homoserine lactones as quorum-sensing signals. the predominant respiratory quinone as identified as ubiquinone-9 (q-9) and dna g+c content was 41.4 mol%. comparative 16s rrna gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis placed the strain in a clade with the species a. calcoaceticus, a. haemolyticus, a. baumannii, a. baylyi, and a. beijerinckii, with which it evidenced sequence similarities of 98.2%, 97.4%, 97.2%, 97.1%, and 97.0%, respectively. dna-dna hybridization values between strain dr1(t) and other acinetobacter spp. were all less than 20%. the physiological and taxonomic characteristics with the dna-dna hybridization data supported the identification  of strain dr1(t) in the genus acinetobacter as a novel species, for which the name acinetobacter oleivorans sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is dr1(t) (=kctc 23045(t) =jcm 16667(t)).

TI  == contamination of anesthesia circuits by pathogens.
AB  == background and objectives: evaluation of contamination of anesthesia circuits by  collecting 56 culture samples from the circular system; previously reprocessed tracheas by disinfection with 1% hypochlorite or 2% glutaraldehyde after being washed in non-sterile water and soap and dried by using compressed air and stored in surgical grade paper; and from other places of the non-reprocessed respiratory circuit, before anesthetic procedures. methods: samples from the inspiratory and  expiratory branches of the tracheas, canister, soda-lime, and collector jar (drain) through swab in stuart medium and streaked in agar blood, mac conkey, and sabouraud growth media. results: the level of contamination with fungus and bacteria in the inspiratory and expiratory branches of tracheas reached up to 39.3% in some sites; in some cases, more than one microorganism was present, 75%  fungal and 25% bacterial contamination. cultures were positive for candida sp., dermatophytus sp., penicillium sp., aspergillus sp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. contamination was observed in 25% of the canisters with growth of candida sp., penicillium sp., dermatophytus sp., aspergillus sp., and fusarium sp. in the collector jar, a contamination rate of 36% was observed with growth of candida sp., dermatophytus  sp., s. saprophyticus and acinetobacter baumannii. microorganisms did not grow in soda-lime cultures. conclusions: in all sites investigated except for soda-lime growth of microorganisms was observed with the possibility of cross infection.

AB  == acinetobacter genomic species (gen. sp.) 3 and gen. sp. 13tu are increasingly recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. to define the taxonomic position of these genomic species, we investigated 80 strains representing the known diversity of the acb complex. all strains were characterized by aflp analysis, amplified rdna restriction analysis and nutritional or physiological testing, while selected strains were studied by 16s rrna and rpob gene sequence analysis, multilocus sequence analysis and whole-genome comparison. results supported the genomic distinctness and monophyly of the individual species of the acb complex. despite the high phenotypic similarity among these species, some degree of differentiation between them could be made on the basis of growth at different temperatures and of assimilation of malonate, l-tartrate levulinate or  citraconate. considering the medical relevance of gen. sp. 3 and gen. sp. 13tu, we propose the formal names acinetobacter pittii sp. nov. and acinetobacter nosocomialis sp. nov. for these taxa, respectively. the type strain of a. pittii  sp. nov. is lmg 1035(t) (=cip 70.29(t)) and that of a. nosocomialis sp. nov. is lmg 10619(t) (=ccm 7791(t)).

TI  == identification of streptomyces sp. kh29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the actinomycete strain kh29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. based on the diaminopimelic acid (dap) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (sem), kh29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus  streptomyces. by way of its noted 16s rdna nucleotide sequences, kh29 was found to have a relationship with streptomyces cinnamonensis. the production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (py) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees c. the antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including ms and nmr as a cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). cyclo(l-trp-l-trp), from the py cultures of kh29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant acinetobacter baumannii. furthermore, cyclo(ltrp- l-trp) had antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus  niger, and candida albicans, however, it was ineffective against streptomyces murinus.

TI  == effects on salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration of coating  hens' eggs with chitosan.
AB  == chitosan is a biopolymer with antimicrobial activity and film-forming properties. in this study, the effects on salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration of coating hens' eggs with chitosan was evaluated. a chitosan was selected from eight types (four non-commercial and four commercial) based on its  antimicrobial activity against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (s. enteritidis). for this purpose, a contact plate method was developed and chitosans were applied at a concentration of 0.25% (w/v). a commercial type with  a molecular weight of 310-375 kda and a deacetylation degree of 75% that reduced  s. enteritidis by 0.71 log(10) colony forming units compared to the control (without chitosan) was selected for further studies. the chitosan was shown to have antimicrobial activity against other egg borne bacteria, i.e., acinetobacter baumannii, alcaligenes sp., carnobacterium sp., pseudomonas sp., serratia marcescens and staphylococcus warneri, and against s. enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes. the effects of various  concentrations of the selected chitosan (0.25%, 1% and 2%) on salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration were assessed using the agar molding technique. effective reduction of eggshell contamination could not be demonstrated, but trans-shell penetration was significantly reduced in the presence of a 2% chitosan eggshell coating, with only 6.1% of the eggs being penetrated compared to 24.5% of the uncoated eggs. it was concluded that the 2% chitosan coating has the potential to reduce contamination of egg contents resulting from trans-shell penetration by s. enteritidis.

TI  == genomics-driven reconstruction of acinetobacter nad metabolism: insights for antibacterial target selection.
AB  == enzymes involved in the last steps of nad biogenesis, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (nadd) and nad synthetase (nade), are conserved and essential in most bacterial species and are established targets for antibacterial drug development. our genomics-based reconstruction of nad metabolism in the emerging  pathogen acinetobacter baumannii revealed unique features suggesting an alternative targeting strategy. indeed, genomes of all analyzed acinetobacter species do not encode nadd, which is functionally replaced by its distant homolog nadm. we combined bioinformatics with genetic and biochemical techniques to elucidate this and other important features of acinetobacter nad metabolism using a model (nonpathogenic) strain acinetobacter baylyi sp. adp1. thus, a comparative kinetic characterization of pnca, pncb, and nadv enzymes allowed us to suggest distinct physiological roles for the two alternative, deamidating and nondeamidating, routes of nicotinamide salvage/recycling. the role of the niap transporter in both nicotinate and nicotinamide salvage was confirmed. the nondeamidating route was shown to be transcriptionally regulated by an adp-ribose-responsive repressor nrtr. the nadm enzyme was shown to possess dual substrate specificity toward both nicotinate and nicotinamide mononucleotide substrates, which is consistent with its essential role in all three routes of nad biogenesis, de novo synthesis as well as the two salvage pathways. the experimentally confirmed unconditional essentiality of nadm provided support for  the choice of the respective enzyme as a drug target. in contrast, nade, encoding a glutamine-dependent nad synthetase, proved to be dispensable when the nondeamidating salvage pathway functioned as the only route of nad biogenesis.

TI  == prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in mexico: special focus on acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in mexico over a 3-year period. clinical isolates of a. baumannii (n = 550), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of a.  baumannii, 40% of escherichia coli, 34% of p. aeruginosa, 22% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of a. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. a. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. species from enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. for p. aeruginosa,  the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. with regard to s. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). the high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.

TI  == clinical manifestations, antimicrobial therapy, and prognostic factors of monomicrobial acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteremia.
AB  == objectives: bacteremia due to acinetobacter baumannii complex (abc), which composed of four genomic species (gen. sp.), is a serious and potentially fatal condition. the epidemiology and outcome of such infections due to individual gen. sp. remain undefined. methods: a retrospective study of patients with monomicrobial abc bacteremia over six years was conducted at a medical center to  determine the association of gen. sp. with clinical outcome. results: included were 291 patients with monomicrobial abc bacteremia. of them, 222 (76.3%) patients had bacteremia caused by gen. sp. 2, i.e. a. baumannii. the presence of  multidrug-resistant phenotype was the only independent predictor of acinetobacter gen. sp. 2 bacteremia (adjusted odd ratio, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 3.8-14.7; p < 0.001). patients with acinetobacter gen. sp. 2 bacteremia had a higher sepsis-related (p = 0.006) and 30 day (p = 0.028) mortality rates than the non-acinetobacter gen. sp. 2 group. the fatal outcome was independently associated with high spas ii scores (p = 0.002), rapidly fatal underlying diseases (p = 0.002), bacteremia caused by acinetobacter gen. sp. 2 (p = 0.01), inappropriate definitive antimicrobial therapy (p < 0.001), and severe sepsis (p  < 0.001). conclusion: acinetobacter gen. sp. 2 bacteremia heralded a worse clinical outcome, and therefore the gen. sp. identification of abc bacteremic isolates is justified.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

AB  == bacteria belonging to the genus acinetobacter are ubiquitous in soil and water. only a few species, including acinetobacter baumannii, and the unnamed acinetobacter genomic species (gen. sp.) 3 and 13tu, which together with the soil organism acinetobacter calcoaceticus are combined in the a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii (acb) complex, have been recognized as important nosocomial infectious  agents. the ecology, epidemiology and pathology of most species are not yet well  established. lack of practical and accurate methods limits routine identification of clinical isolates and thus hampers precise identification of those of the acb  complex and other acinetobacter species of possible clinical significance. we previously identified a 350 bp highly variable zone on the rpob gene which appeared to be a promising target for rapid molecular identification. in the present study, we validated this method for accuracy on a collection of reference strains belonging to a. calcoaceticus (5 strains), acinetobacter gen. sp. 3 (29 strains), a. gen. sp. 13tu (18 strains), a. baumannii (30 strains) and one strain each of a. radioresistens, a. gen. sp. 15tu, a. gen. sp. 10, a. gen. sp. 11, a. gen. sp. 'between 1 and 3' and a. gen. sp. 14tu=13bj. this represents the largest analysis to date that compares a large number of well-identified strains of the acb complex to assess the intra- and interspecies variation within this complex.  all were correctly identified with 98.9-100 % intraspecies relatedness based on partial rpob sequence analysis. we then applied this tool to identify 99 acinetobacter clinical isolates from four public hospitals in marseille, france.  all isolates could easily be identified to species as they were separated into 13 species sequence types with a sequence variance of 0-2.6% from their respective type strains. of these 99 isolates, 10 were a. haemolyticus, 52 were a. baumannii, 27 were a. gen. sp. 3, 5 were a. schindleri, 1 was a. lwoffii, and 1 was a. gen. sp. 13tu. three were provisionally identified as a. gen. sp. 9. this  is the first work to identify all specimens of a set of clinical acinetobacter isolates at species level using rpob sequence analysis. our data emphasize the recognition of a. schindleri as an emerging cause of acinetobacter-related infection and confirm that a. gen. sp. 3 is the second most commonly isolated acinetobacter species after a. baumannii in patients.

AB  == a non-motile and rod shaped bacterium, designated strain b1(t), was isolated from forest soil at mt. baekwoon, republic of korea. cells were gram-negative, catalase-positive, and oxidase-negative. the major fatty acids were 9-octadecenoic acid (c(18:1) omega9c; 42%) and hexadecanoic acid (c(16:0); 25.9%) and summed feature 3 (comprising iso-c(15:0) 2-oh and/or c(16:1) omega7c; 10.0%). the dna g+c content was 44.1 mol%. a phylogenetic tree based on 16s rrna gene sequences showed that strain b1(t) formed a lineage within the genus acinetobacter and was closely related to a. baylyi dsm 14961(t) (98.6% sequence similarity), followed by a. baumannii dsm 30007(t) (97.4%), a. calcoaceticus dsm  30006(t) (97.0%) and 3 genomic species (96.8 approximately 7.6%). phenotypic characteristics, gyrb gene sequence analysis and dna-dna relatedness data distinguished strain b1(t) from type strains of a. baylyi, a. baumannii, and a. calcoaceticus. on the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain b1(t) represents a novel species of the genus acinetobacter, for which the name acinetobacter soli sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is b1(t) (= kctc 22184(t)= jcm 15062(t)).

TI  == [toxigenic effect of acinetobacter baumannii isolated from children with acute diarrhoea].
AB  == diarrheal diseases with diarrhea are the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in children; however the causative agent cannot be identified always, which suggests the presence of unknown enteropathogens inducing diarrhea. the isolation of acinetobacter sp. from feces of children with acute diarrhea, unrelated to known enteropathogens motivated this investigation to detect a possible enterotoxigenic effect on ht-29 cells. the study population comprised 150 children with an age range from 0 to 5 years old; 120 were assisted in the "hospital materno infantil del este'' with gastrointestinal syndrome and 30 healthy controls who went to the center for routine analysis. in 25% of symptomatic patients were diagnosed parasites and bacteria, identified routinely. from four symptomatic patients were isolated three acinetobacter baumannii strains and two a. calcoaceticus strains. the strains were cultured in brain-heart infusion for 24 and 48 hrs, at 35 degrees c, and the supernatants were obtained by centrifugation and filtration and their activity tested on ht-29 cell monolayers. the supernatants of the three strains of a. baumannii induced alterations of the cell monolayer, showed by detachments of cell monolayers, cell segregation, cell rounding and swelling. these effects were more intense with the 48 h culture exoproducts of the 016 strain, which were higher than the positive control. this toxigenic effect of a. baumannii, could represent a pathogenic mechanism whose definition requires more studies to determine the possible role in the pathogenicity of this bacillus.

TI  == oligonucleotide array-based identification of species in the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex in isolates from blood cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates.
AB  == acinetobacter calcoaceticus, a. baumannii, acinetobacter genomic species (gen. sp.) 3, and acinetobacter gen. sp. 13tu, which are included in the a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex, are difficult to distinguish by phenotypic methods. an array with six oligonucleotide probes based on the 16s-23s rrna gene  intergenic spacer (its) region was developed to differentiate species in the a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex. validation of the array with a reference collection of 52 strains of the a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex and 137 strains of other species resulted in an identification sensitivity and specificity of 100%. by using the array, the species distribution of 291 isolates of the a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex from patients with bacteremia were determined to be a. baumannii (221 strains [75.9%]), acinetobacter gen. sp. 3 (67 strains [23.0%]), acinetobacter gen. sp. 13tu (2 strains [0.7%]), and unidentified acinetobacter sp. (1 strain [0.3%]). the identification accuracy of  the array for 12 randomly selected isolates from patients with bacteremia was further confirmed by sequence analyses of the its region and the 16s rrna gene. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 291 isolates from patients with bacteremia revealed that a. baumannii strains were less susceptible to antimicrobial agents than acinetobacter gen. sp. 3. all acinetobacter gen. sp. 3  strains were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, imipenem, and meropenem; but only 67.4%, 90%, and 86% of the a. baumannii strains were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, imipenem, and meropenem, respectively. the observed significant variations in antimicrobial susceptibility among different species in the a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex emphasize that the differentiation of species within the complex is relevant from a clinical-epidemiological point of view.

TI  == acinetobacter radioresistens as a silent source of carbapenem resistance for acinetobacter spp.
AB  == carbapenem resistance results mostly from the expression of acquired carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinases in acinetobacter baumannii. the bla oxa-23 oxacillinase gene is increasingly reported worldwide and may represent an emerging threat. our goal was to identify the progenitor of that carbapenemase gene. a collection of 50 acinetobacter sp. strains corresponding to several acinetobacter species was screened for bla(oxa-23)-like genes by pcr and hybridization techniques. five acinetobacter radioresistens isolates that were susceptible to carbapenems harbored chromosomally encoded bla oxa-23-like genes.  a similar plasmid backbone was identified in several bla oxa-23-positive a. baumannii and a. radioresistens isolates, further strengthening the vectors of exchanges for these bla oxa-23-like genes. therefore, a. radioresistens, a commensal bacterial species which is identified on the skin of hospitalized and healthy patients (a property shared with a. baumannii), was identified as the source of the bla oxa-23 gene.

TI  == acinetobacter septicus sp. nov. association with a nosocomial outbreak of bacteremia in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == acinetobacter species other than acinetobacter baumannii have rarely been reported to be associated with nosocomial outbreaks of bloodstream infections. within a period of 1 week, seven acinetobacter-like isolates were recovered from  peripheral blood and catheter specimens of five patients at a neonatal intensive  care unit (nicu) in a tertiary hospital in turkey. all five patients had placement of central venous catheters and had received total parenteral nutrition before the onset of bacteremia. two of the five patients died. medical devices, tap water, aerators, water samples, various surfaces, intravenous fluids, and the hands of health care workers in the nicu were sampled and were culture negative for the bacterium. all seven of the isolates had identical biochemical reactions, antimicrobial susceptibility results, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, indicating a clonal nosocomial outbreak. a panel of standard biochemical reaction profiles and three phenotypic commercial identification systems failed to identify these isolates. phenotypically, the isolate differed from acinetobacter ursingii by its hemolysis on sheep blood agar and its negative citrate utilization. sequences of the full 16s rrna gene, which contained at least three different gene copies with polymorphic sequences between nucleotide positions 70 and 206, were determined from the first recovered isolate. the complete 1,529- to 1,531-bp 16s rrna gene sequences and partial 801-bp rpob gene  sequences had similarities of 99.5% and 97.2%, respectively, to an a. ursingii isolate. the dna-dna similarities of the strain against the type strain of a. ursingii were 64.7 and 68.7%, which were lower than the recommended threshold value of 70% for the definition of bacterial species. these data indicate that a  novel acinetobacter organism caused the nosocomial outbreak of bacteremia in the  nicu unit. we propose the designation of acinetobacter septicus sp. nov. for these isolates, with isolate ak001 as the type strain.

TI  == five-year review of infections in a burn intensive care unit: high incidence of acinetobacter baumannii in a tropical climate.
AB  == a 5-year review of nosocomial infections, bacteraemia and wound colonization in patients admitted to a burn intensive care unit from june 2001 to may 2006 was carried out. all patients required intubation at some point, and icu support. data on bacterial and fungal isolates were entered prospectively into a hospital-wide computerized database. nosocomial infections (nis) were defined using standard cdc criteria. seventy-six patients were admitted during the study  period, with 57 qualifying for analysis. forty-two patients (74%) developed 137 nis, with 240 nis/100 admissions. the most common ni was pneumonia (43%), followed by burn wound infection (34%), primary bloodstream infection (20%) and urinary tract infection (3%). the device specific rate of pneumonia was 143 infections per 1000 ventilator days. there were 113 episodes of bacteraemia and 173 episodes of wound colonization without infection. the most common organisms causing nosocomial infections were acinetobacter sp. (n=33), followed by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n=24) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=22). a. baumannii isolates were highly multiresistant, with 82 distinct strains isolated from 47 patients (82% of patients). data from this and  other studies supports the hypothesis that a. baumannii is more common in tropical, warm climes necessitating vigorous infection control measures to optimise patient outcome.

TI  == biodegradation of 4-chloroaniline by bacteria enriched from soil.
AB  == 4-chloroaniline has been released into the environment due to extensive use in chemical industries and intensive agriculture; hence, it becomes one of the hazardous pollutants in the priority pollutant list. in this study, three gram-negative bacteria were enriched and isolated from agricultural soil as 4-chloroaniline-degrading bacteria. they were identified as acinetobacter baumannii ca2, pseudomonas putida ca16 and klebsiella sp. ca17. they were able to utilize 4-chloroaniline as a sole carbon and nitrogen source without stimulation  or cocultivation with aniline or another cosubstrate. the biodegradation in these bacteria was occurred via a modified ortho-cleavage pathway of which the activity of chlorocatechol 1, 2-dioxygenase was markedly induced. they grew well on 0.2-mm 4-chloroaniline exhibiting a 60-75% degradation efficiency and equimolar liberation of chloride. the isolates were able to survive in the presence of 4-chloroaniline at higher concentrations (up to 1.2 mm). 2-chloroaniline, 3-chloroaniline and aniline, but not 3, 4-dichloroaniline, were also growth substrates for these isolates. the results of cosubstrate supplementation illustrated the suitable conditions of each isolate to improve growth rate and 4-chloroaniline biodegradation efficiency. these results suggest that these isolates have a potential use for bioremediation of the site contaminated with 4-chloroaniline.

TI  == characterization of beta-ketoadipate pathway from multi-drug resistance bacterium, acinetobacter baumannii du202 by proteomic approach.
AB  == in this study, the biodegradative activities of monocyclic aromatic compounds were determined from the multi-drug resistant (mdr) acinetobacter baumannii, which were studied in the form of clinical isolates from a hospital in korea. these bacteria were capable of biodegrading monocyclic aromatic compounds, such as benzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate. in order to determine which pathways are available for biodegradation in these stains, we conducted proteome analyses of benzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate-cultured a. baumannii du202, using 2-de/ms analysis. as genome db of a. baumannii was not yet available, ms/ms analysis or de novo sequencing methods were employed in the identification of induced proteins. benzoate branch enzymes [catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (cata) and benzoate dioxygenase alpha subunit (bena)] of the beta-ketoadipate pathway were identified under benzoate culture condition and p-hydroxybenzoate branch enzymes [protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase alpha subunit (pcag) and 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase (pcab)] of the beta-ketoadipate pathway were identified under p-hydroxybenzoate culture condition, respectively, thereby  suggesting that strain du202 utilized the beta-ketoadipate pathway for the biodegradation of monocyclic aromatic compounds. the sequence analysis of two purified dioxygenases (cata and pcagh) indicated that cata is closely associated  with the cata of acinetobacter radiresistance, but pcagh is only moderately associated with the pcagh of acinetobacter sp. adp1. interestingly, the fused form of pcad and pcac, carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase (pcacd), was detected on benzoate-cultured a. baumannii du202. these results indicate that a. baumannii du202 exploits a different beta-ketoadipate pathway from other acinetobacter species.

TI  == bacterial identification, clinical significance, and antimicrobial susceptibilities of acinetobacter ursingii and acinetobacter schindleri, two frequently misidentified opportunistic pathogens.
AB  == the species belonging to the acinetobacter genus are currently reported as opportunistic pathogens in hospitalized patients with underlying predispositions. however, except for the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex, the identification of other species is frequently unreliable, especially for acinetobacter ursingii and acinetobacter schindleri, newly described in 2001. thus, the clinical significance, phenotypic features, and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these two misidentified species remain unclear. of 456 acinetobacter sp. clinical strains isolated from 2002 to 2005 in henri mondor hospital, 15 isolates (10 a. ursingii and 5 a. schindleri isolates) were studied. they were characterized using a phenotypic approach (api 20 ne and vitek 2 systems), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents with evaluation of impact in clinical relevance. the two corresponding type strains were also included for comparison. all isolates were identified to the species level using molecular tools, whereas the phenotypic methods remained unreliable due to the absence of these two species in the manufacturers' databases. however, the api 20 ne system appeared to be a reasonably reliable phenotypic alternative for the identification of a. ursingii when the numerical code 0000071 was found. conversely, no discriminative phenotypic alternative existed for a. schindleri isolates. concerning antimicrobial susceptibility, a. ursingii strains appeared to be more resistant to antibiotics than a. schindleri  strains, which could imply therapeutic consequences. finally, the prevalence of infections caused by a. ursingii and a. schindleri (representing 9.7% and 4.8% of non-a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex strains, respectively) seems to be underestimated.

(60%) and alcaligenes sp. (58%) were primary invaders followed by s. enteritidis (43%). all selected strains were able to penetrate; penetration was observed most frequently after ca. 4-5 days. particularly s. enteritidis was a primary invader of whole eggs: the membranes and/or the content of 32% of the whole eggs was contaminated. the remaining bacterial eggshell contamination with the selected strain was determined after 3 weeks storage. penetrated eggshells and contaminated whole eggs showed a significantly higher bacterial contamination on the eggshell compared to non-penetrated eggshells and  non-contaminated whole eggs respectively (global results of all strains). the influence of hen age on bacterial eggshell penetration and egg content contamination was not significant. while the agar approach is suitable to study the influence of the eggshell characteristics on the bacterial eggshell penetration, the intact egg approach gives an estimation of the penetration of the shell followed by the probability of survival and migration in whole eggs.

AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is a strictly aerobic bacterium which causes severe infections, however its pathogenic characteristics are not well defined. thirteen a. baumannii strains isolated from urine of hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients with different ages were investigated for the presence of virulence factors. the isolates belonged to biotypes 2, 6, and 9 and were sensitive to imipenem. the majority of them showed resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. none of a. baumannii strains presented genes codifying for 17 different virulence factors previously described in uropathogenic escherichia coli, when tested by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). nine isolates agglutinated human group ab erythrocytes, in presence of mannose, but none of them agglutinated group o erythrocytes. adherence to polystyrene was  observed in 7 isolates, and this result did not correlate with that obtained in hemagglutination assay. all the isolates were able to grow in iron-limiting conditions, showing that a. baumannii produces some type of siderophore. however, the genes iuta and fyua, from iron uptake system of e. coli and yersinia sp., respectively, were not present in the isolates, suggesting the presence of a different type of siderophore. the fimbriae of a. baumannii strains that mediates the adherence are possibly mannose-resistant, even though the mechanism of adherence to human epithelial cells still remains to be elucidated.

AB  == a novel aminoglycoside resistance gene, aac(6')-iad, encoding aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferase, was identified in acinetobacter genospecies 3 strain a-51. the gene encoded a 144-amino-acid protein, which shared modest identity (up to 36.7%) with some of the aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferases. the results of high-pressure liquid chromatography assays confirmed that the protein is a functional aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferase. the enzyme conferred resistance to amikacin, tobramycin, sisomicin, and isepamicin but not to gentamicin. the prevalence of this gene among acinetobacter clinical isolates in japan was then investigated. of 264 acinetobacter sp. strains isolated from geographically diverse areas in japan in 2002, 16 were not susceptible to amikacin, and aac(6')-iad was detected in 7. five of the producers of aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferase type iad were identified as acinetobacter baumannii, and two were identified as acinetobacter genospecies 3. these results suggest that aac(6')-iad plays a substantial role in amikacin resistance among acinetobacter spp. in japan.

TI  == molecular and structural characterization of the hmp-ab gene encoding a pore-forming protein from a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the major outer membrane protein of acinetobacter baumannii is the heat-modifiable protein hmp-ab, a porin with a large pore size allowing the penetration of solutes having a molecular weight of up to approximately 800 da. cross-linking experiments with glutardialdehyde failed to show any cross-linking  between the monomers, a fact that proves again that this porin protein functions  as a monomeric porin. the specific activity of this porin was found to be similar to that of other monomeric porins. tryptic digestion of the outer membrane yielded a 23-kda fragment of the hmp-ab protein that was resistant to further trypsin treatment. this observation indicates that hmp-ab is assembled in the membrane in a manner similar to monomeric porins. cloning of the hmp-ab gene revealed an open reading frame of 1038 bp encoding a protein of 346 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 35,636 da. the amino acid sequence and composition were typical of gram-negative bacterial porins: a highly negative hydropathy index, absence of hydrophobic residue stretches, a slightly negative total charge, low instability index, high glycine content, and an absence of cysteine residues. sequence comparison of hmp-ab with other outer membrane proteins revealed a clear homology with the monomeric outer membrane proteins, outer membrane protein a (ompa) of enterobacteria, and outer membrane protein f (oprf) of pseudomonas sp. secondary structure analysis indicated that hmp-ab has  a 172-amino acid n-terminal domain that spans the outer membrane by eight amphiphilic beta strands and a c-terminal domain that apparently serves as an anchoring protein to the peptidoglycan layer. the results also indicate that hmp-ab belongs to the eight transmembrane beta-strand family of outer membrane proteins.

TI  == identification of acinetobacter species isolated from clinical specimens by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis.
AB  == background & objectives: taxonomy of acinetobacter has been changing ever since it was recognized to be associated with human infections. many biochemical schemes and molecular methods have been used for the species identification of this bacterium. recently a simple molecular method called amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) has been used to determine the genomospecies of acinetobacter: an attempt is made in the present study to identify the acinetobacter genomospecies isolated from clinical specimens using ardra and to see whether the environmental isolates are similar to those obtained from clinical specimens. methods: a total of 142 consecutive isolates of acinetobacter sp. obtained from different clinical specimens (125) and environmental samples (17) of postoperative neurosurgery-intensive care unit were studied using ardra.  amplification was done using primers of 16s rrna gene followed by restriction with alu i, cfo i and mbo i enzymes separately to obtain a profile of patterns specific for a species. results: of the 125 clinical isolates, 107 were acinetobacter baumannii (genomospecies 2) and 18 were a. calcoaceticus (genomospecies 1); while 11 of the 17 environmental isolates were a. baumannii and 6 had unidentifiable patterns which were not found in the clinical isolates.  interpretation & conclusion: we found that ardra was a simple and reproducible method to be used in a clinical laboratory for identification of acinetobacter species. a. baumannii was found to be the commonest species isolated from the patients and environment in our hospital. the presence of the same species of acinetobacter in the environment suggests the role of environment as a source of  infection to the patients in high risk units.

TI  == severe nosocomial infections with imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii treated with ampicillin/sulbactam.
AB  == forty consecutive patients with nosomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii were treated with intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam. the infections were primary bloodstream (32.5%), pneumonia (30%), urinary tract (15%), peritonitis (7.5%), surgical site (7.5%), meningitis (5%) and sinusitis (2.5%). most were severe infections with underlying conditions (median apache ii  score: 14.5) and 72.5% occurred in the icu. twenty-seven (67.5%) were improved/cured, seven (17.5%) were failures and six (15%) were considered to have an indeterminate outcome because patients died within the first 48 h of treatment. two cases of meningitis were treated and did not respond. the median daily dose of ampicillin/sulbactam was 6 g/3 g and six patients received 12 g/6 g. no adverse effects were observed. this study indicates that ampicillin/sulbactam may be a good and safe therapeutic option to treat severe nosocomial infections caused by multi-drug resistant a. baumannii.

TI  == outbreak of acinetobacter baumannii in an intensive care unit associated with tracheostomy.
AB  == a case-control study was conducted to determine risk factors for acquisition of an epidemic strain of acinetobacter baumannii in an intensive care unit. the epidemic strain was identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and was isolated from tracheal secretions in 13 (87%) of 15 patients. in a logistic regression analysis, presence of a tracheostomy was an independent risk for acinetobacter sp acquisition (odds ratio, 421; 95% confidence interval, 13.8-12925; p =.001) and the strength of the association was inversely related to the duration of mechanical ventilation. the outbreak coincided with the introduction of a policy of early percutaneous tracheostomy in the intensive care unit and probably resulted from inadequate infection control practices during respiratory care. no environmental reservoir was found. institution of contact precautions, enhanced handwashing, and staff education was associated with resolution of the outbreak.

TI  == cerebrospinal meningitis with the presence of acinetobacter spp.
AB  == the study was conducted on 16 strains of acinetobacter sp. which were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. the diagnostic material was analysed with the use of automatic bact/alert system (organon teknika). the analysis was performed in the  department of microbiology, medical university in bydgoszcz. api 20ne system (biomerieux) enabled the identification of 14 strains (87.5%) as a. baumannii, 1  strain as a. haemolyticus and 1 strain as a. lwoffii. the micro-organisms were isolated from patients whose age ranged between 4 and 66 years. these patients were treated in the departments of neurosurgery (75.0%), neurology (18.8%) and intensive therapy (6.2%). the infection of cerebrospinal fluid was caused by injury and subsequent exposure to the bacteria present in external environment. antibiotic-sensitivity of these micro-organisms was evaluated with the help of disc-diffusion method, observing standardisation conditions outlined by nccls. all the strains proved sensitive to carbapenems, 15 strains were sensitive to netilmicin, 7 strains--to tobramycin and 7 strains--to amikacin. all the strains  displayed multiple resistance. the only exception was a. haemolyticus. the use of two-discs allowed for the detection of esbls in 7 a. baumannii strains. positive  results were most frequently obtained after the combination of sublactam and aztreonam. due to microscopic resemblance between acinetobacter spp., and bacteria of neisseria, moraxella and haemophilus genus, microbiological diagnostics should not be restricted to microscopic assessment of cerebrospinal fluid and quick serological tests evaluating the antigens of the most frequent aetiological factors. considering multiple resistance of acinetobacter spp. to antibiotics, the treatment should be based on sensitivity tests and the ability of a given antibiotic to penetrate into cerebrospinal fluid. in our opinion, both reasonable antibiotic policy as well as observing the principles of hygiene and monitoring infections play equally important roles in the prevention of infections with acinetobacter spp. such combined measures may help to prevent the spreading of multiple resistant strains in hospital environment.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia: importance of recognition of aetiological agents to define  an appropriate initial empirical therapy.
AB  == of the 16,024 patients hospitalized from january 1995 to october 1997, 397 (2.4%) acquired nosocomial pneumonia and the aetiological agent was defined in 101 (25%). about 82% developed late onset pneumonia (>7 days of hospitalization). the site of isolation of microorganisms was bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) (49%), blood culture (39%), pleural effusion (10%) and (2%) pulmonary tissue. gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 54% of infections. staphylococcus aureus (34%) was  the most frequent microorganism isolated followed by acinetobacter baumannii (29%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, responsible for 7% of nosocomial pneumonia. monotherapy gave good cover for early onset pneumonia, but  not for late onset pneumonia. based on our selection criteria, ciprofloxacin was  the best monotherapy for early (50%) and late (31%) onset pneumonia. vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin gave cover of 85% of early and 64% of late onset pneumonia. monotherapy with ciprofloxacin and also combination therapy of ciprofloxacin plus vancomycin may be good options as initial empirical therapy for nosocomial pneumonia.

TI  == biotyping, serotyping and ribotyping as epidemiological tools in the evaluation of acinetobacter baumannii dissemination in hospital units, sorocaba, sao paulo,  brazil.
AB  == dissemination of acinetobacter baumannii strains in different units of a hospital in sorocaba, sao paulo, brazil was evaluated over a period of two years. by using biotyping, serotyping and ribotyping, 27 distinct clones were differentiated among 76 strains isolated between 1993-94, from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. two clones, 2:o4:a (biotype:serotype:ribotype) and 2:o29:a accounted for the majority of strains widely disseminated in the units during 1993. the introduction in the hospital setting, of a new clone, 6:o13:b, at the end of 1993 and its predominance through 1994 is discussed. among 15 strains isolated from neonates, 6 (40%) belonged to the same clone, 2:o4:a. interestingly, this clone was almost all recovered in neonatal intensive care unit, nursery and in pediatric unit. all strains were susceptible to imipenem and polymyxcin b. multiresistant strains (up to 12 antimicrobial agents) accounted for 66.7% and 84.8% of the strains isolated in 1993 and in 1994, respectively.

TI  == molecular and antibiogram relationships of acinetobacter isolates from two contrasting hospitals in the united kingdom and south africa.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the molecular relationships and antibiograms of nosocomial isolates of acinetobacter spp. from two acute-care hospitals in nottingham, uk, and soweto, south africa, with different hospital infection control problems and procedures. in contrast to nottingham, where randomly amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting demonstrated that a single multiresistant strain of acinetobacter baumannii has predominated in the hospital intensive care unit over an 11-year period, the soweto isolates formed a heterogeneous group of unrelated molecular clusters of different antibiograms, with numerous different strains of acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter sp. 3 and acinetobacter sp. 13tu apparently being endemic throughout the soweto hospital. the contrasting results illustrate the need to maintain exemplary infection control procedures in hospitals where high standards have been achieved and warn of what might result if such measures are diminished.

TI  == intravenous colistin as therapy for nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == sixty nosocomial infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii resistant to aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, quinolones, penicillins,  monobactams, and imipenem were treated with colistin (one patient had two infections that are included as two different cases). the infections were pneumonia (33% of patients), urinary tract infection (20%), primary bloodstream infection (15%), central nervous system infection (8%), peritonitis (7%), catheter-related infection (7%), and otitis media (2%). a good outcome occurred for 35 patients (58%), and three patients died within the first 48 hours of treatment. the poorest results were observed in cases of pneumonia: only five (25%) of 20 had a good outcome. a good outcome occurred for four of five patients with central nervous system infections, although no intrathecal treatment was given. the main adverse effect of treatment was renal failure; 27% of patients with initially normal renal function had renal failure, and renal function worsened in 58% of patients with abnormal baseline creatinine levels. colistin may be a good therapeutic option for the treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

TI  == [treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients--results of a multicenter study  using a fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime)].
AB  == objective: to evaluate efficacy and safety of cefepime in severe pneumonia of hospitalized patients. design and patients: a prospective, multicenter, open trial was performed with 148 patients (62 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; 34  with community-acquired pneumonia and 52 undefined forms). cefepime was intravenously administered (1,000 to 2,000 mg every 12 hours), and doses were adjusted for renal function. the efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 48 hours after completion of therapy. results: the mean age was 56.4 +/- 20.31 years. the most common bacterias isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia were: 5 (8.06%) pseudomonas aeruginosa; 7 (11.29%) pseudomonas sp.; 6 (9.68%) klebsiella sp.; 3 (4.84%) e. coli; 2 (3.23%) acinetobacter baumannii; 3 (4.84%) staphylococcus aureus; 3 (4.84%) streptococcus pneumoniae; 5 (8.06%) others. the  most common isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: 2 (5.88%) streptococcus pneumoniae; 1 (2.94%) s. aureus; 2 (5.88%) p. aeruginosa and 2 (5.88%) k. pneumoniae. clinical efficacy was demonstrated in 137/148 (92.56%) of the cases since improvement was obtained in 20.27% and healing in 72.29%. failure of the treatment was observed in 10 patients (6.75%) and one patient the evaluation was not possible. adverse events were reported for 5/148 patients (3.38%). conclusion: our data suggest that cefepime was safe and effective for treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of proteolytic acinetobacter strains based on the sequence  of genes encoding aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferases.
AB  == the sequence of seven aac(6')-i genes encoding aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferases from proteolytic acinetobacter strains including genomic  species 14, 15, 16, and 17 and from ungrouped proteolytic strains 631, 640, and bm2722 was determined. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna of these strains and of acinetobacter sp. 6 cip a165 digested with sfii followed by hybridization with rrna and aac(6')-i specific probes indicated that these genes  were located in the chromosome. phylogenetic analysis of the genes indicated that aac(6')-i of a. baumannii, acinetobacter ungrouped strain 631, and acinetobacter  sp. 16 formed a cluster (91.5 to 92.3% identity) whereas aac(6')-i of acinetobacter sp. 15, sp. 17, and acinetobacter ungrouped strain bm2722 formed another cluster (90.7 to 94.6% identity). a third cluster was constituted by a. haemolyticus and acinetobacter sp. 6 (83.6% identity). the phylogeny drawn from aac(6')-i sequences was consistent with that based on dna-dna hybridization and phenotype comparison. the aac(6')-i genes were all species specific except for aac(6')-ih located in a 13.7-kb non conjugative plasmid from a. baumannii bm2686. we conclude that aac(6')-i genes may be suitable for identification at the species level and for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships of acinetobacter.

AB  == background: although gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of  gram positive bacteria is increasing. the objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. methods and results: the presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the haematological clinic in 1995. haemocultures (apparatus bact/alert 120, cultivation media organon-teknika) and urine were examined. the sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. in blood most frequently staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis and staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). in urine the following were detected: staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), enterococcus sp. (14.5%), escherichia coli (13.1%), enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). in all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. conclusions: investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.

AB  == background: acinetobacter sp. is an important cause of nosocomial infections and  it is often resistant to many antibiotics. in our hospital it often causes infections in patients on the intensive care unit. the aim of this study was to know the susceptibility of acinetobacter sp. strains isolated in our hospital. methods: the in vitro activities of nine antimicrobial agents (ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin  and colistin) and three beta-lactamase inhibitors (sulbactam, clavulanate and tazobactam) against 107 clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii were studied. mics were determined by a dilution agar method, except for colistin, which we used the disk-diffusion agar method. results: of the antimicrobial agents tested imipenem and colistin were highly active against all isolates (100% susceptibility), meropenem presented good activity (96.3% susceptibility), ticarcillin presented moderated activity (84.1% susceptibility). most of the strains were resistant to ceftazidime (4.7% susceptibility), piperacillin (3.7% susceptibility) and the aminoglycosides (amikacin 21.5% susceptibility, gentamicin 2.8% susceptibility and tobramycin 4.7% susceptibility). sulbactam was the most active agent among the beta-lactamase inhibitors studied (cmi90 = 4 micrograms/ml). conclusions: recent trends indicate increasing antimicrobial resistance of acinetobacter baumannii, posing a serious threat to hospitalized patients. an strict attention to maintain a good housekeeping and control of the  environment and of the antimicrobial usage, appears the measures most likely to control the spread of acinetobacter baumannii in hospitals.

TI  == survival of acinetobacter baumannii on dry surfaces.
AB  == acinetobacter spp. have frequently been reported to be the causative agents of hospital outbreaks. the circumstances of some outbreaks demonstrated the long survival of acinetobacter in a dry, inanimate environment. in laboratory experiments, we compared the abilities of five acinetobacter baumannii strains, three acinetobacter sp. strains from the american type culture collection (atcc), one escherichia coli atcc strain, and one enterococcus faecium atcc strain to survive under dry conditions. bacterial solutions of the 10 strains were inoculated onto four different material samples (ceramic, polyvinyl chloride, rubber, and stainless steel) and stored under defined conditions. we investigated the bacterial counts of the material samples immediately after inoculation, after drying, and after 4 h, 1 day, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of storage. a statistical model was used to distribute the 40 resulting curves among four types of survival curves. the type of survival curve was significantly associated with  the bacterial strain but not with the material. the ability of the a. baumannii strains to survive under dry conditions varied greatly and correlated well with the source of the strain. strains isolated from dry sources survived better than  those isolated from wet sources. an outbreak strain that had caused hospital-acquired respiratory tract infections survived better than the strains from wet sources, but not as well as strains from dry sources. resistance to dry  conditions may promote the transmissibility of a strain, but it is not sufficient to make a strain an epidemic one. however, in the case of an outbreak, sources of acinetobacter must be expected in the dry environment.

AB  == nosocomial infections encountered in intensive care units are frequently due to gram negative bacilli among which stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter sp., and enterobacter sp. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the new broad spectrum cephalosporins cefepime (fep) and cefpirome (cpo) alone or in combination with amikacin (akn), gentamicin (gtn) or ciprofloxacin (cip) against acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterobacter cloacae producing a derepressed cephalosporinase. this study was performed by using the time-kill curve method on 24 h with a starting inoculum of 10(6) - 10(7) cfu/ml. the combination of fep (4 mg/l) with akn (4 mg/l) against a. baumanii only results in about 1 log decrease at 24 h, but when fep is combined at 8 mg/l, the decrease reaches 4 log in 24 h. the combination of fep (16 and 32 mg/l) clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) resulted in 3 log decrease at 24 h. when combined with cip 2 mg/l, fep (16 and 32 mg) resulted in 5 and 6 log decrease in 24 h respectively. there were no survival bacteria at 6 h when fep (32 mg/l) was combined with clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) and gtn (8 mg/l) at 6 h. used alone fep (1 mg/l) or cpo (1 mg/l) against e. cloacae, a 3 log decrease occurs at 6 h followed by a regrowth at 24 h. combined with akn (2 mg/l), fep (1  mg/l) results in a 6 log decrease at 24 h, when cpo at 2 mg/l is needed for an equivalent result. these data show synergistic bactericidal activity of both new  extended cephalosporins combined with akn, gtn or cip at concentrations achievable in biological fluid with adaptative dosage regimen.
