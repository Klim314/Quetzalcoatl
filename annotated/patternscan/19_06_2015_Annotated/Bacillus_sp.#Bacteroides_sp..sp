TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  == calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in astragali radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. however, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria  to metabolize calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, five strains including bacteroides  sp.13, and sp.58, clostridium sp.21-2, veillonella sp.43-1, and bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to  convert calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. a total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof-ms). the results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. on the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus, bifidobacterium were less severely affected. this indicates that calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.

TI  == effect of liquiritin on human intestinal bacteria growth: metabolism and modulation.
AB  == licorice is one of the oldest and most frequently used prescribed traditional chimese medicines. however, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate  to exert physiological effects. therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, six strains, comprising bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, bacillus sp. 46 and clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. a total  of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. the results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin.  on the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an emax precision microplate reader. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and  bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium was less severely affected.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease.

TI  == identification of isoquercitrin metabolites produced by human intestinal bacteria using uplc-q-tof/ms.
AB  == in this paper, ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof/ms) and the metabolynx software combined with mass  defect filtering were applied to identity the metabolites of isoquercitrin using  an intestinal mixture of bacteria and 96 isolated strains from human feces. the human incubated samples collected for 72 h in the anaerobic incubator and extracted with ethyl acetate were analyzed by uplc-q-tof/ms within 10 min. the parent compound and five metabolites were identified by eight isolated strains, including bacillus sp. 17, veillonella sp. 23 and 32 and bacteroides sp. 40, 41,  56, 75 and 88 in vitro. the results indicate that quercetin, acetylated isoquercitrin, dehydroxylated isoquercitrin, hydroxylated quercetin and hydroxymethylated quercetin are the major metabolites of isoquercitrin. furthermore, a possible metabolic pathway for the biotransformation of isoquercitrin was established in intestinal flora. this study will be helpful for understanding the metabolic route of isoquercitrin and the role of different intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of natural compounds.

TI  == identification of rutin deglycosylated metabolites produced by human intestinal bacteria using uplc-q-tof/ms.
AB  == in this paper, rutin was metabolized by human intestinal bacteria and five isolated strains including bacillus sp. 52, bacteroides sp. 45, 42, 22 and veillonella sp. 32, the metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof/ms). as a result, bacillus sp. 52 and bacteroides sp. 45 could metabolize rutin to quercetin 3-o-glucoside and leucocyanidin. bacteroides sp. 42 and veillonella sp. 32 could convert rutin to leucocyanidin. bacteroides sp. 22 could hydrolyze rutin to quercetin-3-o-glucoside. in order to further explain the metabolism pathway of rutin, the beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-rhamnosidase activities of five strains were determined. bacteroides sp. 22 could produce alpha-l-rhamnosidase but did not produce beta-d-glucosidase or beta-d-glucosidase activity was too low to be detected. the other four strains all demonstrated alpha-l-rhamnosidase and beta-d-glucosidase activities. furthermore, alpha-l-rhamnosidase and beta-d-glucosidase activities of veillonella sp. 32 and  bacteroides sp. 42 were higher than those of bacteroides sp. 45 and bacillus sp.  52. based on these results, we can propose the deglycosylated rout of rutin: rutin was metabolized to be quercetin-3-o-glucoside by alpha-l-rhamnosidase produced from these bacteria, thereafter, quercetin-3-o-glucoside was further metabolized by beta-d-glucosidase to form leucocyanidin. because of the higher enzyme activity in veillonella sp. 32 and bacteroides sp. 42, quercetin-3-o-glucoside was completely metabolized to leucocyanidin by these two  bacteria. due to the lack of beta-d-glucosidase activity, bacteroides sp. 22 could not further metabolize quercetin-3-o-glucoside to leucocyanidin. this study will be helpful for understanding the deglycosylated rout of rutin and the role of different intestinal bacteria on the metabolism of natural compounds.

TI  == epizootic rabbit enteropathy inoculum (tec4): antibiograms and antibiotic fractionation.
AB  == epizootic rabbit enteropathy (ere) emerged and spread in europe within the last 13 years causing major economical loss. the aims of the study was to evaluate antibiograms of tec4, an inoculum composed of an extract of intestinal content of affected rabbits, and to test the potential of different antibiotic-based tec4 fractions to reproduce the disease. twenty nine different antibiotic discs were incubated for determining bacteria resistance. in a complementary study, nine tubes of liquid medium were inoculated with tec4, incubated and added individually with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, bacitracin, ceftiofur, doxycycline, novobiocin, streptomycyin, tylosin, vancomycin and 0.9% saline solution as control. the content of each tube was washed by centrifugation and suspended in saline. the three most effective antibiotics are florfenicol, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and tylosin. a high concentration of clostridium sordelli and bacillus firmus were isolated in all fractions. species never cultured from tec4 were identified as fusobacterium necrogenes (in vancomycin fraction), cellulomonas sp (in novobiocin fraction) and bacteroides distasonis (in doxycycline fraction). the ere was reproduced when bacitracin, doxycycline and 0.9% fractions were inoculated. rabbits showed ere clinical signs with the specific drop in daily weight gain.

TI  == extremophile culture collection from andean lakes: extreme pristine environments  that host a wide diversity of microorganisms with tolerance to uv radiation.
AB  == a total of 88 bacterial strains were isolated from six andean lakes situated at altitudes ranging from 3,400 to 4,600 m above sea level: l. aparejos (4,200 m), l. negra (4,400 m), l. verde (4,460 m), l. azul (4,400 m), l. vilama (4,600 m), and salina grande (3,400 m). salinity ranged from 0.4 to 117 ppm. general diversity was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis. from the excised dgge bands, 182 bacterial sequences of good quality were obtained. gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga/flavobacterium/bacteroides (cfb) were the most abundant phylogenetic groups with 42% and 18% of identified bands,  respectively. the isolated strains were identified by sequence analysis. isolated bacteria were subjected to five different uv-b exposure times: 0.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. afterwards, growth of each isolate was monitored and resistance was classified according to the growth pattern. a wide interspecific variation among  the 88 isolates was observed. medium and highly resistant strains accounted for 43.2% and 28.4% of the isolates, respectively, and only 28.4% was sensitive. resistance to solar radiation was equally distributed among the isolates from the different lakes regardless of the salinity of the lakes and pigmentation of isolates. of the highly resistant isolates, 44.5% belonged to gammaproteobacteria, 33.3% to betaproteobacteria, 40% to alphaproteobacteria, 50% to cfb, and among gram-positive organisms, 33.3% were hgc and 44.5% were firmicutes. most resistant strains belonged to genera like exiguobaceterium sp.,  acinetobacter sp., bacillus sp., micrococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., sphyngomonas sp., staphylococcus sp., and stenotrophomonas sp. the current study provides further evidence that gammaproteobacteria are the most abundant and the most uv-b-resistant phylogenetic group in andean lakes and that uv resistance in bacteria isolated from these environments do not depend on pigmentation and tolerance to salinity.

TI  == decomposition and mineralization of aquatic humic substances (ahs) in treating landfill leachate using the anammox process.
AB  == aquatic humic substance (ahs) in landfill leachate is resistant to biodegradation, especially in anaerobic habitats. however, we reported here for the first time that ahs was completely biodegraded with the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process. as a result of aromatic-ring cleavage and mineralization, carboxylic and aliphatic organics were significantly produced, the contents of chromophores such as quinoid and ketone were remarkably decreased to decolorize the leachate, and produced carbon dioxide along with increasing carbonate was clearly presented. of the degraded ahs of 137 mg l(-1), 51 mg l(-1) was owed to the oxidation with sulfate of 76 mg l(-1) as electron acceptor, and the rest to other metabolic mechanism. isolation and identification of heterotrophic bacteria revealed a diversified consortium comprising four facultative anaerobic species, bacillus sp., paenibacillus sp., bacteroides sp. and staphylococcus sp., without sulfate-reducing bacteria detected. their contribution to ahs biodegradation and sulfate reduction under the special conditions with high oxidization-reduction potential and insufficient electron acceptors has not been known yet. further work is underway to investigate their properties and respective duties in the consortium.

TI  == proteolytic activity in stored aerobic granular sludge and structural integrity.
AB  == aerobic granules lose stability during storage. the goal of this work was to highlight the main cause of stability loss for stored granules as intracellular protein hydrolysis. the quantity of extracellular proteins was noted to be significantly lower during granule storage, and protease enzyme activities were correspondingly higher in the cores of stored granules. the proteolytic bacteria, which secrete highly active protease enzymes, were for the first time isolated and characterized by analyzing 16s rdna sequences. the proteolytic bacteria belonged to the genera pseudomonas, raoultella, acinetobacter, pandoraea, klebsiella, bacillus and uncultured bacterium, and were grouped into proteobacteria, enterobacteria and firmicutes. the pb1 (pseudomonas aeruginosa) strain, which exhibited very high proteolytic activity during the skim milk agar  test, was located at the core regime with active protease enzymes, and was close  to the obligate anaerobic strain bacteroides sp. hence, the extracellular proteins in stored granules were proposed to be hydrolyzed by enzymes secreted by proteolytic bacteria with the hydrolyzed products ultimately being used by nearby anaerobic strains. this process gradually digests the protein core, and eventually consumes the entire granule.

TI  == effects of rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of pulverized petal of rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. however, the growth of bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. in liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. but the growth of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. hydrolyzable tannins isolated from r. rugosa, rugosin d, and tellimagradin ii showed antibacterial activities against e. coli,  s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp., but little or no effect against bif. breve and l. salivarius. r. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. hydrolyzable tannins in r. rugosa, such as rugosin d and tellimagradin ii, must be active constituents.

TI  == [characterization of communities of heterotrophic bacteria associated with healthy and diseased corals in nha trang bay (vietnam)].
AB  == a comparative investigation of the heterotrophic microflora of 11 species of healthy corals and of white-band-diseased and yellow-band-diseased corals inhabiting the reefs of nha trang bay (vietnam), which has been exposed to anthropogenic impact, was performed. fifty-nine strains of heterotrophic bacteria isolated on y/k and endo media were investigated and characterized. all the isolates were identified at the genus level by consideration of the results of analysis of their phenotypic properties, determination of the molar percent of g+c bases in their dna, and the composition of fatty acids of their lipids. in the composition of the microflora of tissues of healthy corals, gamma-proteobacteria prevailed, with halomonads being dominant among them. in addition, the gram-negative bacteria included pseudomonas and vibrio spp., members of the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides (cfb) phylogenetic cluster, and moraxella sp. the gram-positive bacteria revealed included bacillus, staphylococcus, halococcus, and micrococcus spp., and coryneform bacteria. in the composition of the microflora of the tissues of affected corals, bacteria of the  family enterobacteriaceae and of the genera planococcus and arthrobacter, which were not revealed in healthy hydrobionts, were found. the anthropogenic impact is not the sole factor determining the infection of corals.

TI  == comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppgpp synthetases/hydrolases (the rel, rela and spot proteins).
AB  == in the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppgpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, rela and spot, whereas in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis only one  enzyme named rel is responsible for this activity. rel and spot also possess (p)ppgpp hydrolase activity. blast searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. the construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. four groups could be distinguished: with the exception of neisseria and bordetella (beta subdivision), the rela and spot groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. two rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the bacillus/clostridium group were also identified. the spot proteins are related to the gram positive rel proteins. rela proteins carry substitutions in the hd domain (aravind and koonin, 1998, tibs 23: 469-472) responsible for ppgpp degradation. a theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous rela and spot genes is presented: after  gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spot and rela genes evolved from the duplicated genes. the distribution pattern of the paralogous rela and spot proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (gupta, 2000, fems microbiol. rev. 24: 367-402). this model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. however, two paralogous, closely related genes of porphyromonas gingivalis (cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the rela and spot proteins do not fit in this model. completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (treponema pallidum, chlamydia species, rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont buchnera sp. aps as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes  but they are present in the arabidopsis genome. in crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppgpp as crosslinking reagents and rna polymerase preparations of escherichia coli, binding of ppgpp to distinct regions at the c-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpob gene product) and/or at the n-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpoc gene product) was observed previously. rpob and rpoc sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppgpp binding regions.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == [effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  == the results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. in the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and actinomyces. significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. there was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine  used locally showed satisfactory results. the above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: bacillus coagulans, b.  licheniformis, pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.

AB  == clinical isolates of agar-pitting, formate-fumarate-requiring, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were recharacterized in consideration of the species descriptions of bacteroides ureolyticus and the newly described b. gracilis, campylobacter concisus, and wolinella sp. during an 11-year period, 7.5% (101 of  1,341) of all specimens yielding anaerobes were found to contain an organism in this group. of the 71 isolates that were available for study, 43 were b. ureolyticus, 23 were b. gracilis, and 5 were in the wolinella-c. concisus group.  the role in infection and patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility for b. ureolyticus and b. gracilis were studied. review of the clinical data indicated that 83% of b. gracilis strains were recovered from patients with serious visceral or head and neck infection, whereas 73% of b. ureolyticus isolates were  recovered from superficial soft-tissue or bone infections. the strains of b. ureolyticus were uniformly susceptible to the tested antimicrobial agents. b. gracilis, however, showed some striking resistance, with penicillin active against only 67% and the cephalosporins active against 67 to 84% of the isolates  tested. the association of b. gracilis with serious deep-tissue infection, coupled with the relatively high frequency of antibiotic resistance, indicates that it is an important, previously unrecognized, pathogen.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

AB  == a 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. there is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. another died. at autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. the deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (scid). the autopsy findings showed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of scid. after a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (dv) was placed in the isolator. laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes  showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (pha). specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. the patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four hla matches but none has  been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (mlc). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter agglomerans, microcossu sp. subgroup 1,  bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: p. acnes, c. bifermentans, b. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, e. agglomerans, c. parapsilosis. no viruses or protozoa have been isolated. at age 3 years, the mean quantitation of  anaerobic cells was 7.9 x 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. the mean aerobic concentration was 1.2  x 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. this child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...

TI  == the effect of pneumostrongylus tenuis (nematoda: metastrongyloidea) on kids.
AB  == kids, 6-28 weeks of age, infected with 200-1000 infective larvae of meningeal worm (pneumostrongylus tenuis) of white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus), developed colitis and peritonitis. bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., escherichia coli, proteus sp. and enterococcus sp. were found in the peritoneal cavity. most  kids were moribund or dead 4-11 days after infection and frequently the colon had ruptured. only two kids (of 11) in which the disease was allowed to run its course survived colitis and peritonitis but these two animals developed severe neurologic signs 18 and 38 days after infection. numerous developing worms and various traumatic and other lesions were found in the central nervous system of kids which developed neurologic signs.

TI  == tryptophanase in diverse bacterial species.
AB  == the distribution of tryptophanase was studied. the highest observed specific activity, mumoles per minute per milligram (dry weight) cells, is given in parentheses after each species. tryptophanase was inducible and repressible in escherichia coli (.914), paracolobactrum coliforme (.210), proteus vulgaris (.146), aeromonas liquefaciens (.030), photobacterium harveyi (.035), sphaerophorus varius (.021), bacteroides sp. (.048), and corynebacterium acnes (.042). the enzyme was constitutive and nonrepressible in bacillus alvei (.013),  and was inducible but not repressible by glucose in micrococcus aerogenes (.036). indole-positive bacteria were found in fecal or intestinal samples from a variety of animals among the mammals, reptiles, insects, molluscs, fish, crustaceans, and amphibians.
