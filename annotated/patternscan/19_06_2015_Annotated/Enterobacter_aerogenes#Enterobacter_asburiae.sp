TI  == carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary hospital in madrid, spain: high percentage of colistin resistance among vim-1-producing klebsiella pneumoniae st11 isolates.
AB  == here we describe the carbapenemase genes, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility data of 123 carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) clinical isolates recovered from 2010 to 2012, comprising klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 79), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), serratia marcescens (n = 14), enterobacter cloacae (n = 12), enterobacter asburiae (n = 4) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1). vim-1 was the most common carbapenemase (n = 101) followed by kpc-2 (n = 19), oxa-48 (n = 2) and imp-22 (n = 1). among the k. pneumoniae isolates, nine sequence types (sts) were identified but two clones were dominant: st11 (54/79) containing mainly vim-1-producing isolates; and st101 (13/79) constituted by kpc-2-producing strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) showed a higher  genetic diversity among the remaining enterobacteriaceae. amikacin and fosfomycin were the most active agents with 82.9% and 80.5% susceptibility, respectively. non-susceptibility to tigecycline was detected in 36.5% of strains. overall, colistin resistance was 24.7% and was as high as 47% in enterobacter spp. an increase in colistin resistance from 13.5% to 31.7% was observed among k. pneumoniae isolates during the study period. resistance was focused on st11 since 83.3% of colistin-resistant strains belonged to this clone. the high level of colistin resistance observed in this study is worrying with respect to the already limited therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == molecular identification of aiia homologous gene from endophytic enterobacter species and in silico analysis of putative tertiary structure of ahl-lactonase.
AB  == the aiia homologous gene known to encode ahl- lactonase enzyme which hydrolyze the n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) quorum sensing signaling molecules produced by gram negative bacteria. in this study, the degradation of ahl molecules was determined by cell-free lysate of endophytic enterobacter species. the percentage of quorum quenching was confirmed and quantified by hplc method (p<0.0001). amplification and sequence blast analysis showed the presence of aiia homologous  gene in endophytic enterobacter asburiae vt65, enterobacter aerogenes vt66 and enterobacter ludwigii vt70 strains. sequence alignment analysis revealed the presence of two zinc binding sites, "hxhxdh" motif as well as tyrosine residue at the position 194. based on known template available at swiss-model, putative tertiary structure of ahl-lactonase was constructed. the result showed that novel endophytic strains of enterobacter genera encode the novel aiia homologous gene and its structural importance for future study.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the asia-pacific region: results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections  (iai) from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the asia-pacific region were investigated. detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex pcr. a total of 699 enterobacteriaceae  isolates with positive genotypic results, included escherichia coli (n = 443), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), citrobacter freundii (n = 5), proteus mirabilis (n = 3), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of enterobacter asburiae, proteus vulgaris, and providencia rettgeri were analyzed.  nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated iai. ctx-m (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with ctx-m-15) was the most common esbl, followed by shv (n = 59) and tem (n = 4). cmy (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with cmy-2) was the most common ampc beta-lactamase, followed by dha (n = 46) and act/mir (n = 40). ndm (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with ndm-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by imp (n = 7) and oxa (n = 7). isolates from hospital-associated iai had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in enterobacteriaceae isolates from  india, except that imp beta-lactamases were also detected in philippines and australia. ctx-m beta-lactamases were the predominant esbls produced by enterobacteriaceae causing iai in the asia-pacific region. emergence of ctx-m-15-, cmy-2-, and ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.

TI  == spread of an ompk36-modified st15 klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  == we aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ert-r, n = 15) enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in  a portuguese hospital in a short period of time (march-july 2010). antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multi-locus sequence typing (mlst)], plasmid content and  major enterobacterial porins were investigated. ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ert-r klebsiella pneumoniae st15 pfge-types: (i) a sporadic variant (kp-a-ert, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompk36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (kp-b-ert, n = 7) exhibiting a new ompk36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. st14 (n = 1) and  st45 (n = 1) k. pneumoniae, st131 (n = 1) and st354 (n = 1) escherichia coli, enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ert-r clones were also sporadically detected. porin changes in  these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompk35, ompk36, ompf; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 4-32 mg/l], is-mediated porin disruptions (ompk36, ompc; mic = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the l3 loop (ompk36; mic = 4-16 mg/l). we describe, for the first time in portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ert-r enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. moreover, our results support that a ctx-m-15-producing st15 k. pneumoniae with an ompk36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.

TI  == enterobacter soli sp. nov.: a lignin-degrading gamma-proteobacteria isolated from soil.
AB  == a gram-negative bacterium that formed cream-colored colonies designated strain lf7 was isolated from soil collected in the tambopata national reserve in madre de dios, peru. 16s rrna sequence comparisons indicate that lf7 is a novel enterobacter sp. closely related to e. asburiae jcm 6051(t) [ab004744] and e. aerogenes jcm 1235(t) [ab004750] based on their sequence homologies (p-distance:  1.06 and 1.19%, respectively). dna g + c content was 52.8 mol% which is within the range reported for e. asburiae (55-57 mol%). the major cellular fatty acids present in the lf7 strain were c(16:0) (27.3%), c(16:1) omega7c and/or c(16:1) omega6c (16.3%), c(18:1) omega7c (16.1%), c(17:0) cyclo (12.4%), c(14:0) 3-oh and/or c(16:1) iso-i (8.9%), c(14:0) (7.6%), c(12:0) (3.9%), c(17:0) (2.4%), c(13:0) 3-oh and/or c(15:1) iso-h (1.7%), c(13:0) (1.1%), and c(18:2) omega6,9c and/or c(18:0) ante (0.5%). the cellular fatty acid profile, g + c content, phenotypic and biochemical characteristics were consistent with its placement in  the genus enterobacter. the name enterobacter soli is proposed for this bacterium.

TI  == isolation and characterization of plant growth promoting bacteria from non-rhizospheric soil and their effect on cowpea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp.) seedling growth.
AB  == the efficacy of four potential phosphate solubilizing enterobacter isolated from  non-rhizospheric soil in western ghat forest in india. plant growth promoting ability of these isolates was evaluated in cowpea. all are gram negative, rod shaped, 0.8-1.6 mm in size, and psychrotrophic in nature, grow from 5 to 40 degrees c (optimum temp. 28 +/- 2 degrees c). all isolates exhibits growth at a wide range of ph 6-12, optimum at ph 7.0 and tolerates up to 7% (w/v) salt concentration. 16s rrna gene sequencing reveals the confirmation of isolates to enterobacter aerogenes sp. (nii-0907 and nii-0929), enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae sp. (nii-0931) and enterobacter asburiae sp. (nii-0934) with which they share >99% sequence similarity. under in vitro conditions, all the four isolates  were found to produce indole acetic acid, p-solubilization and hydrogen cyanide.  the p-solubilizing activity coincided with a concomitant decrease in ph of the medium (ph 7.0-<3.0). the plant growth promotion properties were demonstrated through a cow pea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp) based bioassay under greenhouse conditions. although the bacterial inoculation was found to result in significant increment in root, shoot and biomass and it stimulated bacterial counts in the rhizosphere. hence, these isolates can further formulated and used for field application.

TI  == beta-lactamases and detection of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacter spp.
AB  == enterobacter spp. are becoming increasingly frequent nosocomial pathogens, and beta-lactam-resistant strains are on the increase, especially among isolates recovered from intensive care units. therefore, a study was designed to characterize the beta-lactamases produced by 80 isolates of e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, e. taylorae, e. gergoviae, e. sakazakii, e. asburiae, and e. agglomerans by induction studies, spectrophotometric hydrolysis assays, and isoelectric focusing. the ability of broth microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests to detect resistance to 16 beta-lactam antibiotics among these species was also assessed. all species except e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, and some isolates of e. sakazakii were found to produce a bush group 1 cephalosporinase that was expressed inducibly or constitutively at high levels. in addition, some strains also produced a bush group 2 beta-lactamase. in comparisons of broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests, disk diffusion tests failed to detect resistance in 1 of 25 isolates resistant to aztreonam and 2 of 30 isolates resistant to ceftazidime. these results indicate that species of enterobacter can possess a variety of beta-lactamases that are responsible for beta-lactam resistance in this genus and that the disk diffusion test may occasionally miss resistance in some strains.
