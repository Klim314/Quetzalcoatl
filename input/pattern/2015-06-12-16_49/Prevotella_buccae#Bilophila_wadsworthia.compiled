TI  - Activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. Gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions. Peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii) and Porphyromonas spp. (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. The MICs of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium innocuum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Anaerobiospirillum spp., Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and the Prevotella oris-buccae group. Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while Fusobacterium varium strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other Fusobacterium species, such as Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium russii, as well as Veillonella spp., the Prevotella melaninogenica group, Prevotella bivia, Clostridium difficile, and Bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (MIC(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
TI  - Bilophila wadsworthiain brain abscess: case report.
AB  - A case of a patient with a 20-year history of chronic otitis media complicated by cholesteatoma and brain abscess is described. A CT scan with contrast material showed three abscess cavities in the right cerebellar hemisphere. A culture from a specimen of the cholesteatoma yielded a significant amount of growth of Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella oris and a moderate growth of alpha-streptococci and Staphylococcus simulans. From the pus of the brain abscess we also isolated numerous Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella oris and some Prevotella buccae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. No aerobes were present. The patient underwent a craniotomy and the biggest abscess was removed together with the capsule. The antimicrobial therapy included penicillin plus metronidazole and later augmentin. The result of the treatment was a complete cure and total recovery of the patient. This is the first documentation of isolation of B. wadsworthia in chronic otitis media and in brain abscess.
