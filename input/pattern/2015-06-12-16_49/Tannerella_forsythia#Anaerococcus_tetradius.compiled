TI  - The presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. However, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. The aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. METHODS: The research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24 were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. Information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery, general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. At 12 months of age, both groups of infants were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and dental plaque samples were collected. The microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus spp., Actinomyces spp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a PCR-based method. The chi-squared and Fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. RESULTS: The infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of Fusosbacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. Periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. A significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of S. mutans. Most of the very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of S. mutans in full-term infants than in premature infants.
TI  - The effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into the study. Each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. All patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. Plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rDNA microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. RESULTS: Plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. The greatest differences in plaque composition were seen with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. Post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Eubacterium nodatum, while Campylobacter rectus, Parvimonas micra, and Actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.
TI  - Microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples compared to that of whole saliva in patients with periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. However, recently, salivary analysis has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (AgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP). METHODS: Whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with CP and 33 patients with AgP. Twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16S ribosomal RNA-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. RESULTS: All bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. For Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia, as well as Actinomyces viscosus, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra, Eubacterium nodatum, and Campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types of periodontitis. There were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between AgP and CP. CONCLUSION: Salivary analysis might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for microbiologic analysis in both AgP and CP.
TI  - [Expression of cytokines in dentogingival sulcus in patients after dental implantation and during development of peri-implantitis].
AB  - AIM: Determination of cytokine content in various areas of dentition in patients  with peri-implantitis associated with parodontopathogenic bacteria species of I and II order. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 patients with complications that developed in 3 months to 14 years after installation of intraosteal dental implants were examined. Content of cytokines in various areas of dentition was determined by using solid phase enzyme immunoassay in patients with developed peri-implantitis associated with parodontopathogenic bacteria species of I and II order. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used for determination of parodontopathogenic bacteria marker DNA. RESULTS: Marker DNA of I order parodontopathogenic bacteria - Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia (Bacteroides forsythus), Porphyromonas gingivalis in peri-implantation tissues during implant rejection was detected with 34.4 - 75% frequency while II order (Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micros (Peptostreptococcus micros), Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum etc.) - with significantly lower frequency. Total concentration of IL- 1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, IL- 17A and INFgamma in contents of pathological pocket in the area of implants and the levels of each of them were significantly higher than in the contents of parodontal pockets, areas with stable implants and gingival fluid from areas with healthy teeth. Total interleukin content in the contents of pathological pockets in the area of rejected implants was significantly higher than in other studied areas. In the exudate of parodontal pockets of the preserved teeth it was 2.4 times lower, in the area of stable implants - 4.6 times lower, and in the areas with healthy teeth - 4.8 times lower than with rejected implants (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the study conducted allow to make a conclusion regard- ing reasonability of monitoring during dental implantation of parodontopathogenic microorganism strains and local cytokine response of the host organism with the objective of rational prophylaxis and therapy of inflammatory complications.
TI  - Presence of oral bacterial species in primary endodontic infections of primary teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of the microbial composition of deciduous endodontic infections is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of the 10 oral bacterial species in samples from primary tooth root canals by using microarray technology and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical conditions. STUDY DESIGN: The samples were collected from 30 root canals of primary teeth with primer infection. The bacterial composition of the samples was semi-quantitatively defined using a microarray system (Parocheck). RESULTS: All the tested species were detected in the samples. Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most frequently isolated bacterium (96.7%), followed by Prevotella intermedia (86.7%), Parvimonas micra (83.3%), Treponema denticola (76.7%) and Tannerella forsythia (66.7%). These bacteria were also present in high levels. All pairs of bacterial species were positively associated (RR > 1), except Pintermedia and P > micra. On average, five species (range:3-8) were detected per amplified sample. Root canals of teeth with > 5 different species were statistically associated with periapical radiolucency (P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Primary teeth with endodontic infections show a highly diverse variety of bacteria, in which the most prevalent specie are present in high proportions. The well-directed use of the improved microarray technology will provide additional valuable information for causative factors associated with endodontic diseases, helping to develop more successful antibacterial or anti-inflammatory treatment strategies.
TI  - A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on the clinical and microbial  effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used by patients in supportive periodontal care.
AB  - AIM: This 3-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study evaluated the  clinical and microbial effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control by patients in supportive periodontal care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients were randomly allocated to an essential oil group (Listerine((R)) Coolmint; Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) or placebo group to rinse twice per day as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control. At baseline and after 3 months, plaque index (PI), gingivitis index (GI), probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing (BoP) and clinical attachment level were registered. Subgingival plaque samples were collected for the detection and quantification of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Micromonas micros, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium genus and Streptococcus mutans by means of real-time PCR (qPCR). Patient's compliance, satisfaction and side effects were registered. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients in the essential oil group (mean age: 57) and 21 in the placebo group (mean age: 55) with acceptable oral hygiene at intake (mean PI <1.5 on a scale of 5) adhered to the study protocol. Gingivitis index, PI and BoP significantly reduced over time (P </= 0.029); however, between group analyses revealed no significant differences. There was no significant change over time neither in detection frequency nor load for any of the microbiota. Daily rinsing with an essential oil rinse was found safe and perceived beneficial by the patients. CONCLUSION: Patients in supportive periodontal care who are fairly compliant with oral hygiene may not benefit from additional mouth rinsing using an essential oil solution.
TI  - Long-term follow-up of turned single implants placed in periodontally healthy patients after 16 to 22 years: microbiologic outcome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival rates in implant dentistry today are high, although late failures do occur for many reasons, including peri-implant infections. The primary objective of this study is to investigate microbiota around single turned implants after 16 to 22 years. Secondary objectives are to compare teeth and implants and to correlate microbiologic, radiographic, and clinical parameters. METHODS: A total of 46 patients with single implants were invited for a clinical examination. Clinical data were collected from implants and contralateral natural teeth. Radiographic bone level was measured around implants. Microbiologic samples were taken from implants, contralateral teeth, and the deepest pocket per quadrant. Samples were analyzed with DNA-DNA hybridization including 40 species. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, McNemar tests, and Spearman correlation coefficients with a 0.05 significance level. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 18.5 years (range 16 to 22 years). Tannerella forsythia (1.5 x 10(5)) and Veillonella parvula (1.02 x 10(5)) showed the highest concentrations around implants and teeth, respectively. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and T. forsythia were significantly more present around implants than teeth. Mean counts were significantly higher around implants than teeth for Parvimonas micra, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, T. forsythia, and Treponema denticola. Total DNA count was correlated to interproximal bleeding index (r = 0.409) and interproximal probing depth (r = 0.307). No correlations were present with plaque index or radiographic bone level. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, bacterial counts around single implants in periodontally healthy patients are rather low. Although pathogenic bacteria are present, some in higher numbers around implants than teeth (five of 40), the majority of implants present with healthy peri-implant tissues without progressive bone loss.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - The subgingival microbiota of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. This comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with PLS used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) clonal analysis and the 16S rRNA-based Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: Thirteen patients with PLS from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. Subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic DNA was extracted. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the HOMIM. RESULTS: The most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lachnospiraceae OT 100 (EI074), Parvimonas micra, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. As a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. In the HOMIM analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with PLS. Of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. The high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter spp., Capnocytophaga granulosa, G. morbillorum, P. micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Streptococcus spp., and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota in PLS is diverse. Periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development of severe periodontitis in patients with PLS.
TI  - Clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A limited number of studies suggest a prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, results are inconsistent. The aim of this study is to investigate clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with RA. METHODS: Sixty-six patients with RA, aged 49.5 +/- 8.4 years, participated in the study. The periodontal classification was assessed with the periodontal screening index (PSR/PSI) allocated to the following parameters: 1) healthy; 2) gingivitis (PSR/PSI score 0 to 2, maximum one sextant score; 3) moderate periodontitis (>1 sextant PSR/PSI score 3, maximum one sextant score; or, 4) severe periodontitis (>1 sextant PSR/PSI score 4). Pool samples were taken for microbiologic (polymerase chain reaction) analysis for the presence of 11 periodontal pathogens. Statistical analysis was by non-parametric analysis of covariance. RESULTS: No patients were periodontally healthy: 24 patients were classified as having gingivitis; 18 patients had moderate periodontitis; 23 patients had severe periodontitis; and one patient was toothless. For most patients, Fusobacterium nucleatum (98%), Eikenella corrodens (91%), and Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros; 88%) were above the detection threshold. Strong periodontal pathogens were less frequently detected: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 16%); Porphyromonas gingivalis (58%); and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis, 78%). Statistical analysis showed no significant influence of rheumatic factor (P = 0.33) on periodontal classification and on microbiologic parameters (P >0.05). Only smoking showed a significant influence (P = 0.0004) on the periodontal classification and in the case of E. corrodens (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with RA in this study showed moderate-to-severe periodontitis and the presence of periodontal pathogens. No association was found between rheumatic factor on periodontal classification and microbiologic parameters.
TI  - Early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health around zirconia and titanium  abutments: an in vivo study in man.
AB  - AIM: To compare the early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health of mucosa adjacent to zirconia (ZrO(2)) and titanium (Ti) abutment surfaces in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty edentulous subjects received two endosseous mandibular implants. The implants were fitted with either a ZrO(2) or a Ti abutment (non-submerged implant placement, within-subject comparison, left-right randomization). Sulcular bacterial sampling and the assessment of probing pocket depth, recession and bleeding on probing were performed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. Wilcoxon matched-pairs, sign-rank tests were applied to test differences in the counts of seven marker bacteria and the clinical parameters that were associated with the ZrO(2) and Ti abutments, at the two observation time points. RESULTS: ZrO(2) and Ti abutments harboured similar counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola at 2 weeks and 3 months. Healthy clinical conditions were seen around both ZrO(2) and Ti abutments at all times, without significant differences in most clinical parameters of peri-implant soft tissue health. Mean probing depths around Ti abutments were slightly deeper than around ZrO(2) abutments after 3 months (2.2 SD 0.8 mm vs. 1.7 SD 0.7 mm, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: No difference in health of the soft tissues adjacent to ZrO(2) and Ti abutment surfaces or in early bacterial colonization could be demonstrated, although somewhat shallower probing depths were observed around ZrO(2) abutments after 3 month.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  - The subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. We tested the hypothesis that the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. Subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16S sequencing. Smokers demonstrated greater abundance of Parvimonas, Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Bacteroides, and Treponema and lower levels of Veillonella, Neisseria, and Streptococcus. Several uncultivated Peptostreptococci, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter gracilis, Treponema socranskii, Dialister pneumosintes, and Tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while Veillonella sp. oral clone B2, Neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Capnocytophaga sp. clone AH015 were at lower levels. The microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of a Genius Nd:YAG laser.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the 'in vitro' bactericidal effect of the Nd:YAG laser (Genius, MOlsgaard Dental, Copenhagen, Denmark) on six periodontal pathogens. METHODS: Suspensions of six different periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Parvimonas micra) were prepared in small Eppendorff tubes, and exposed to a Nd:YAG laser for five different periods of time. Laser settings used: Power 6 Watt (on a scale of 1-12 W), Frequency 50 Hz, Pulse duration 250 mus. After exposure to the laser, aliquots of the suspensions were spread on blood agar plates for bacterial counting. RESULTS: After 5 s of laser exposure, there was a decrease in total colony forming units for all six selected microorganisms. After 15, 30 and 45 s, no viable bacterial cells could be retrieved. CONCLUSION: In this 'in vitro' model, 15 s of Nd:YAG laser use was found to be effective for total killing of the six tested periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. The presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. This investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months after bone augmentation. METHODS: Culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. Radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. RESULTS: The presence of periodontal pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia [previously T. forsythensis], Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra [previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros], Campylobacter rectus, enteric Gram-negative rods, and Dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, PCR, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. The PCR-positive triad, P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. The effect on the grafting outcome translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation. Specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.
TI  - The microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the Dental School of the University of Athens, who were split into three age groups. A total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: All of the test species, except Parvimonas micra and Porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial profiles for the different oral surfaces. Supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of Actinomyces species and Green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the Yellow complex. The profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. Many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. Periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. Specifically, the Red complex species (Tannerella forsythia, P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (P < 0.05) in all sample locations. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. Differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of Orange and Red complex species.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in persistent periapical lesions on root-filled teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the bacterial diversity in persistent apical lesions on root-filled teeth by using culture-independent molecular methods. DESIGN: Twenty surgically removed apical lesions from therapy-resistant teeth were examined for the presence of bacterial DNA using PCR targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in 17 of the 20 samples (85%). A total of 236 clones were analyzed. Seven different bacterial phyla were represented and a total of 75 different bacterial taxa were identified; 36% of the species have not yet been cultivated. Commonly detected bacterial species included Fusobacterium spp., Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroidetes spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of bacteria was identified in periapical lesions on therapy-resistant teeth. These bacteria may contribute in the etiology of periapical infection and impede healing of these lesions.
TI  - Correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. This study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels in older persons. METHODS: Elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. Two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [AP]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (PD) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [SP]), if they did not. Groups were compared with respect to demographics, PD, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hsCRP, interleukin (IL)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. RESULTS: Ten AP and 24 SP subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the AP group (P <0.05). Most Asians were SP; most whites and all African Americans were classified as having AP (P <0.01). More AP elders had osteoporosis (P <0.01), but the AP and SP groups did not differ with respect to IL-1beta and -6 or hsCRP. Bacterial counts were higher in the AP group for Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; P <0.05), Prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; P <0.01), Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; P <0.05), and Streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; P <0.01). Three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: PD, osteoporosis, and being white or African American. CONCLUSION: Periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, PD, gender, serum hsCRP, and levels of four bacterial species.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of periodontitis. However, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of PDT in the treatment of periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of PDT to non-surgical periodontal treatment. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of PDT (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). Full-mouth plaque score (FMPS), full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS), probing depth (PD), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (CAL) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. Primary outcome variables were changes in PD and CAL. Microbiologic evaluation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium nodatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS: At 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to CAL, PD, FMPS, or microbiologic changes. At 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly greater improvement in FMBS was found in the test group. CONCLUSION: The additional application of a single episode of PDT to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of PD reduction and CAL gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.
TI  - Root canal microbiota of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  - Samples from infected root canals of 43 teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 83 oral bacterial species and/or phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Associations between the most frequently detected taxa were also recorded. The most prevalent taxa were Olsenella uli (74%), Eikenella corrodens (63%), Porphyromonas endodontalis (56%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (54%), and Bacteroidetes oral clone X083 (51%). When prevalence was considered only for bacteria present at levels >10(5), Bacteroidetes clone X083 was the most frequently isolated bacterium (37%), followed by Parvimonas micra (28%), E. corrodens (23%), and Tannerella forsythia (19%). The number of target taxa per canal was directly proportional to the size of the apical periodontitis lesion, with lesions >10 mm in diameter harboring a mean number of approximately 20 taxa. Several positive associations for the most prevalent taxa were disclosed for the first time and may have important ecological and pathogenic implications. In addition to strengthening the association of several cultivable named species with chronic apical periodontitis, the present findings using a large-scale analysis allowed the inclusion of some newly named species and as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of oral implants from nondental sources.
AB  - Implants showing signs of peri-implantitis harbor a microbiota similar to that of periodontitis-affected teeth. This case report describes the subgingival microbiota of a 45-year-old female with advanced periodontitis before and after complete edentulation and reconstruction with dental implants. A 3-month healing period post extraction passed before implants were placed using a two-stage submerged implant protocol. At 4- to 6-month recall visits after definitive prosthetic reconstruction, some implant sites showed bleeding on probing and localized mucositis. Microbiological culture of three inflamed peri-implant sites showed an almost identical spectrum of pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and other major pathogenic bacteria characteristic of aggressive periodontitis. As natural teeth were absent for 8 months, this case report suggests that periodontal pathogens can be retained for a prolonged period of time in nondental sites, from where they can later colonize and compromise the health of dental implants. The therapeutic implications of this finding are discussed.
TI  - Microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. DNA was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. A PCR assay using species-specific primers of 16S rDNA and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by Peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. Moreover, PCR detected Filifactor alocis in 26.7%, Treponema denticola in 24.4%, and Tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. T. denticola and P. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). P. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). P. endodontalis and P. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). Synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. The results of this study indicated that E. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by PCR in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological determinants of ailing dental implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The failure of the host tissue to establish or maintain osseointegration around dental implants is due to either occlusal or parafunctional forces, premature loading, ill-directed stress, or microbial infection. The long-term failure rate of dental implants is generally 5-10%. Although a variety of etiologies of early peri-implant bone loss (from implant placement to 1-year post-loading) have been proposed, factors associated with late implant failures are less well understood but are probably related to both the peri-implant microbial environment and host factors. Discriminating between causes of implant failure is of importance for instituting a successful implant therapy. PURPOSE: The objective of this cross-sectional split-mouth study was to identify clinical, radiographic, and bacterial characteristics of peri-implant disease sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with bilateral implants (Branemark, Nobel Biocare AB, Goteborg, Sweden; and 3i implant systems, Implant Innovations Inc., Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA) participated in the study. Sites with peri-implant (radiographic bone loss beyond the third implant thread) and peri-implant healthy tissues (radiographic bone level above the first implant thread) were identified in periapical radiographs using a long-cone paralleling projection technique. Microbiological identification was carried out using established anaerobic culture techniques. A descriptive statistics based on means and standard deviations was reported. RESULTS: Peri-implant bone loss was associated with the absence of radiographic crestal lamina dura, peri-implant pocket depth, pain on chewing, and the submucosal presence of the putative periodontopathogens Tannerella forsythia, Campylobacter species, and Peptostreptococcus micros. Pain was associated with P. micros, Fusobacterium species, and Eubacterium species. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The absence of radiographic crestal lamina dura and the presence of suspected major periodontal pathogens seem to be associated to peri-implantitis.
TI  - Bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: Samples collected from five infected root canals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers. Products of these PCRs were cloned and sequenced. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used as a screening method to reduce the number of clones necessary for DNA sequencing. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. In total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. Olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Dialister invisus, Lachnospiraceae oral clone, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. The majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example Tannerella forsythia, Shuttleworthia satelles and Filifactor alocis. Some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
TI  - The effect of HAART on salivary microbiota in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Study the prevalence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in saliva of HIV-positive women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. STUDY DESIGN: 157 HIV-positive and 31 HIV-negative women were studied. At baseline and every 6 months over 4 years, information was collected on socioeconomic and educational status, oral and systemic health, including HIV markers and antiretroviral therapy, and frequency of professional oral care utilization. Bacterial and yeast pathogenic isolates from stimulated whole saliva were tentatively identified using standard methodologies. RESULTS: The prevalence of microorganisms in stimulated saliva of HIV-positive women was not significantly different from that of HIV-negative women. In HIV-positive women, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was independently and significantly associated with the presence of a variety of salivary bacterial species. HAART increased the risk for recovering Fusobacterium species (P < .001), enteric gram-negative rods (P < .05), Peptostreptococcus micros (P < .05), Campylobacter species (P < .0001), Eubacterium species (P < .001), and Tannerella forsythia (P < .01). In contrast, HAART led to decreased recovery rate of yeasts (Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis) (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that the institution of HAART promotes an increasingly pathogenic salivary microbiota, at least temporarily. Similar findings have been reported for various nonoral microbial ecosystems.
TI  - [Efficacy variation of erythromycin and spiramycin on periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis. An in vitro comparative study].
AB  - AIMS: Erythromycin (ERY) and spiramycin (SPI) are the most frequently prescribed  macrolides by dentists. However, the emergence of resistant anaerobic subgingival bacteria imposes an increased vigilance. This study aims to compare these macrolides efficacy on principal periopathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty adult patients with aggressive periodontitis were selected and a total of 60 samples were taken from subgingival flora. Bacterial strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were isolated according to J. Slots's rapid identification method. The susceptibilities to ERY and SPI were studied using disk diffusion susceptibility test and minimum inhibitory concentration test (MIC test). RESULTS: The efficiency variability of ERY and SPI on the 50 isolated anaerobic periopathogens was present either interindividually (between different patients) and intra-individually (within the same patient). While 68% of the tested anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to SPI (22% resistant), only 54% were sensitive to ERY (34% resistant). Although moderate, the efficacy of SPI seemed more regular in general than ERY: it's variation coefficient (40%) is lower than the ERY one (53%). The 7 A. actinomycetemcomitans tested showed all a high resistance. CONCLUSION: In a general way, the spectre of activity of SPI is stacked in that of ERY. However, this study shows a better and regular activity of SPI on the main tested periopathogens. These results are in favour of the use of SPI in periodontology when penicillins and doxycycline are not useful because specific problems are identified (allergy, pregnancy...).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility variation of 50 anaerobic periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis: an interindividual variability study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The frequent use of antibiotics in developed countries has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance. In this study, the interindividual variability of the antibiotic susceptibility of 50 putative microorganisms in aggressive periodontitis patients has been evaluated by means of VC (variation coefficient). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 60 microbial samples were collected from 20 adult patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis (2-4 samples by patient). Bacterial strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros were isolated according to Slots' rapid identification method. The susceptibilities to 10 antibiotics were studied: penicillin G (PEN), ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX), amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMC), tetracycline (TET), doxycycline (DOX), ciprofloxacin (CIP), erythromycin (ERY), spiramycin (SPI) and clindamycin (CLIN), using the Disk Diffusion Susceptibility test (DDS test: Kirby-Bauer's modified method for anaerobic bacteria). The broth microdilution Minimum Inhibitory Concentration test was carried out as a control test. RESULTS: Among the 50 identified bacteria, 15 were P. gingivalis, 12 P. intermedia, 8 T. forsythia, 9 F. nucleatum, and 6 P. micros. The results of the DDS test show that penicillins (especially AMC, AMP, and AMX), cyclines (especially DOX) and CLIN are highly effective against the 50 anaerobic studied bacteria. CIP and ERY have the lowest efficacy against those bacteria. CIP shows a very variable activity according to anaerobic bacteria species, being particularly inactive against P. gingivalis and very efficient against T. forsythia and P. micros. SPI is also highly efficient but not against P. micros. CONCLUSIONS: The interindividual susceptibility of principal periodontal pathogens to antibiotics is not homogeneous and seems to vary according to bacterial species and antimicrobial molecules. This variability seems to be greater with older molecules (PEN, TET, ERY) than with more recent ones, which indicates more stable results (AMC, AMX, AMP, and DOX). P. intermedia appeared to be the bacteria most resistant to penicillins and showed the highest coefficient variation. Together with scaling and root planing, the combination of two antibiotics would therefore seem to be recommended in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis, particularly in the presence of P. intermedia.
TI  - Microbiological profile of early onset/aggressive periodontitis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial profile and to seek possible bacterial associations in the subgingival microbiota of early onset periodontitis/aggressive periodontitis patients by using two different techniques, culture and immunofluorescence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 66 systemically healthy individuals with evidence of early onset periodontitis - 41 females and 25 males aged 23-35 years (mean 31.1 +/- 3.1 years). Bacterial samples were collected from the deepest site in each quadrant, resulting in a total of 264 sites with a mean probing pocket depth of 6.6 +/- 1.5 mm. Samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO(2) using selective and nonselective media, and isolates were characterized to species level. Indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies was applied to detect Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (Bacteroides forsythus, Tannerella forsythensis), Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces israelii. RESULTS: 93.6% of sampled sites showed bleeding on probing and 23.5% were positive for suppuration. P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, and C. rectus were detected in 77.3-85.9% of samples using culture methods and in 85.6-91.3% using immunofluorescence. P. micros and A. actinomycetemcomitans were found, respectively, in 63.3% and 25.0% of all sites using culturing and in 58.7% and 27.7% sites using immunofluorescence. Significantly strong positive associations were observed between T. forsythia and C. rectus (odds ratio 109.46), and T. forsythia and P. gingivalis (odd ratio 90.26), whereas a negative association was seen between P. intermedia/P. nigrescens and A. actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio 0.42). Coinfection by P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, P. intermedia/P. nigrescens and C. rectus was observed in 62.1% of the test sites, and in 89.4% of the studied subjects. The sensitivity of immunofluorescence for T. forsythia, C. rectus, P. intermedia/P. nigrescens and P. gingivalis was found to be very high (0.99-0.94) using culture as the reference detection method. The agreement between culture and immunofluorescence in detecting the presence or absence of the investigated species was 85.2-88.1% for P. gingivalis, P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, C. rectus, and T. forsythia, 75.9% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and 70.4% for P. micros. CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profile of the early onset/aggressive periodontitis population was complex. The agreement between the two detection methods was very high.
TI  - Initial antimicrobial effect of controlled-release doxycycline in subgingival sites.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the ability of a 10% doxycycline hyclate controlled-release polymer (Atridox) to suppress periodontopathic bacteria when placed subgingivally following scaling and root planing (Sc/Rp). METHODS: Eight males and seven females, mean age 48 years, with moderate to advanced periodontitis participated in the study. In each patient, bilateral periodontal pockets probing 6-7 mm were randomly assigned to treatment by Sc/Rp + doxycycline polymer or by Sc/Rp alone. Subgingival placement of doxycycline polymer was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sc/Rp was performed with hand instruments for at least 10 min in each study tooth. Subgingival samples were collected by paper-points at baseline, at 2 weeks and at 4 weeks post-treatment. Culture methodology was used to isolate and identify putative periodontal pathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter species, Eubacterium species, Fusobacterium species, Peptostreptococcus micros, Eikenella corrodens, Staphylococcus species, enteric gram-negative rods, beta-hemolytic streptococci and yeasts. The microbiologic examination was carried out blindly. Microbiological data were analyzed using a General Linear Model Analysis of Variance for within and between group effects. RESULTS: Sites receiving Sc/Rp + doxycycline polymer and sites receiving Sc/Rp alone exhibited similar levels of periodontal pathogens at baseline and did not differ significantly in total viable counts and proportional recovery of periodontopathic bacteria post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Controlled-release doxycycline placed in moderate to deep periodontal pockets caused no significant additional reduction in the subgingival pathogenic microbiota compared to thorough Sc/Rp alone. Since controlled-release doxycycline may not significantly suppress several subgingival pathogenic microorganisms and seems to possess no distinct advantage over broad-spectra, safe and inexpensive antiseptics, the rationale for its employment in periodontal therapy remains unclear.
