TI  - Mapping of the modular closthioamide architecture reveals crucial motifs of polythioamide antibiotics.
AB  - Closthioamide, the first known secondary metabolite from an anaerobic microorganism (Clostridium cellulolyticum), represents a highly potent antibiotic that is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) at nanomolar concentrations. To unveil structure-activity relationships of the unusual polythioamide natural product we have designed a synthetic grid to access analogues with altered terminal aromatic moieties, diverse p-phenyl substituents, different types and sizes of aliphatic spacers, varying numbers of thioamide residues, and diverse sizes and symmetries of the poly-beta-thioalanyl backbone. A library of 28 closthioamide analogues was tested against a panel of human pathogenic bacteria. We found that aromatic terminal groups, the defined length of the spacer groups, the presence of all six thioamide residues and the modular arrangement of the beta-thioalanyl units play essential roles for the antibiotic activity of closthioamide, yet there is a degree of freedom in the symmetry of the molecule. This study yields the first insights into pivotal structural motifs and the structural space of this new family of antibiotics, a prerequisite for the development of these promising antibiotics.
TI  - Structure and flexibility within proteins as identified through small angle X-ray scattering.
AB  - Flexibility between domains of proteins is often critical for function. These motions and proteins with large scale flexibility in general are often not readily amenable to conventional structural analysis such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) or electron microscopy. A common evolution of a crystallography project, once a high resolution structure has been determined, is to postulate possible sights of flexibility. Here we describe an analysis tool using relatively inexpensive small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements to identify flexibility and validate a constructed minimal ensemble of models, which represent highly populated conformations in solution. The resolution of these results is sufficient to address the questions being asked: what kinds of conformations do the domains sample in solution? In our rigid body modeling strategy BILBOMD, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to explore conformational space. A common strategy is to perform the MD simulation on the domains connections at very high temperature, where the additional kinetic energy prevents the molecule from becoming trapped in a local minimum. The MD simulations provide an ensemble of molecular models from which a SAXS curve is calculated and compared to the experimental curve. A genetic algorithm is used to identify the minimal ensemble (minimal ensemble search, MES) required to best fit the experimental data. We demonstrate the use of MES in several model and in four experimental examples.
