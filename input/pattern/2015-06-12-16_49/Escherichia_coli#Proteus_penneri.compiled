TI  - Spectroscopic analysis, DNA binding and antimicrobial activities of metal complexes with phendione and its derivative.
AB  - A novel ligand (E)-2-styryl-1H-imidazo [4, 5-f] [1, 10] phenanthroline(L) has been synthesized from 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione. Its transition metal complexes, [FeLCl4][L-H] and [CuL2](NO3)2 have also been synthesized. Besides, three mixed ligand lanthanide metal complexes of Phendione and beta-diketones have been synthesized, namely [Eu(TFN)3(Phendione)] (TFN = 4,4,4-trifluoro-1(2-napthyl)-1,3-butanedione), [Eu(HFT)3(Phendione)] (HFT = 4,4,5,5,6,6,6-heptafluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-hexanedione), [Yb(HFA)3(Phendione)] (hfa = hexafluoroacetylacetonate). The synthesized ligands and metal complexes have been characterized by FTIR, UV-Visible spectroscopy and PL spectra. DNA binding activities of the complexes and the ligands have been studied by DNA gel electrophoresis. DNA binding studies showed that Fe complex of the synthesized ligand is more potent DNA binding and damaging agent compare to others under study. The synthesized compounds were also screened for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion method against three microbes, namely Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus penneri. The lanthanide complexes of phendione showed great antibacterial activities.
TI  - Structure and gene cluster of the O-antigen of Escherichia coli O109; chemical and genetic evidences of the presence of L-RhaN3N derivatives in the O-antigens of E. coli O109 and O119.
AB  - O-antigen representing the O-polysaccharide chain of the lipopolysaccharide is the most variable constituent on the cell surface of Gram-negative bacteria and a player in their pathogenicity. The O-polysaccharide of Escherichia coli O109 was studied by sugar analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and found to contain a rarely occurring monosaccharide, 2,3-diacetamido-2,3,6-trideoxy-l-mannose (l-RhaNAc3NAc). The following structure of the tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the O-polysaccharide was established, which is closely related to that of Proteus penneri O66: Ac--4-beta-L-RhapNAc3NAc -->4)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->3)-alpha-L-6dTalp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->. The O-antigen gene cluster of E. coli O109 was sequenced and all 14 genes found were assigned functions based on their similarity to genes from the available databases. Putative genes for synthesis of l-RhaN3N were found in E. coli O109 and their homologues in E. coli O119, whose O-antigen has been reported earlier to contain 2-acetamido-2,3,6-trideoxy-3-formamido-d-mannose (d-RhaNAc3NFo). Analysis by GLC of the (S)-2-octyl glycosides confirmed that the absolute configuration of RhaN3N in E. coli O119 should be revised from D TO L.
TI  - Phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of South West Cameroon: public health implications.
AB  - Increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. Unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. Microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. Fish is a major source of protein in Cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. In this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of fish from the Limbe and Tiko beaches in South West Cameroon from May to October 2007. We isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. Data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. Eleven bacterial species were identified, including Escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), Citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), Proteus vulgaris (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), Klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), Klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), Serratia marcescens (4.8%), Serratia odorifera (4.8%), Hafnia alvei (4.4%) and Proteus penneri (2.9%). More contaminated fish were found at Limbe beach than at Tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). When ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). Ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. Almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. The results of our study demonstrate that fish from the coastal waters of South West Cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - Identification of a chromosome-borne expanded-spectrum class a beta-lactamase from Erwinia persicina.
AB  - From whole-cell DNA of an enterobacterial Erwinia persicina reference strain that displayed a penicillinase-related antibiotic-resistant phenotype, a beta-lactamase gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. It encoded a clavulanic-acid-inhibited Ambler class A beta-lactamase, ERP-1, with a pI value of 8.1 and a relative molecular mass of ca. 28 kDa. ERP-1 shared 45 to 50% amino acid identity with the most closely related enzymes, the chromosomally encoded enzymes from Citrobacter koseri, Kluyvera ascorbata, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus penneri, Rahnella aquatilis, Serratia fonticola, Yersinia enterocolitica, and the plasmid-mediated enzymes CTX-M-8 and CTX-M-9. The substrate profile of the noninducible ERP-1 was similar to that of these beta-lactamases. ERP-1 is the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from an enterobacterial species that is plant associated and plant pathogenic.
TI  - Biogenic amines produced by Enterobacteriaceae isolated from meat products.
AB  - Biogenic amines in ground meat and processed meat products are one of the indicators to determine the poor quality raw material. Major histamine forming bacterium was Escherichia coli (strain EC04 with 65.88 mg/100 ml in Brain Heart Infusion medium), followed by the microorganisms Morganella morganii (strain MM4 with 8.40 mg/100 ml and strain MM7 with 8.28 mg/100 ml) and Proteus mirabilis (strain PM02 with 8.76 mg/100 ml), respectively. The highest putrescine production level was found in Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter spp. strains, followed by Serratia grimesii, Proteus alcalifaciens, E. coli, Escherichia fergusonii, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri and Hafnia alvei, respectively. The most important cadaverine producer was E. coli EC03 with a production level of 45.48 mg/100 ml, and of the strains Escherichia vulnaris EV01, Escherichia fergusonii EF06 produced 37.92 mg/100ml and 35.40 mg/100 ml, respectively. On the basis of our results, it can be concluded that the major biogenic amines produced by Enterobacteriaceae are putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine and histamine, both in culture medium and meat products.
TI  - Proteus virulence: involvement of the pore forming alpha-hemolysin (a short review).
AB  - The genus Proteus belongs to the tribe of Proteae in the family of Enterobacteriaceae, and consists of five species: P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. morganii, P. penneri and P. myxofaciens. They are distinguished from the rest of Enterobacteriaceae by their ability to deaminate phenylalanine and tryptophane. They hydrolyze urea and gelatin and fail to ferment lactose, mannose, dulcitol and malonate; and do not form lysine and arginine decarboxylase or beta-galactosidase [1]. Colonies produce distinct "burned chocolate" odor and frequently show the characteristics of swarming motility on solid media. P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and P. morganii are widely recognized human pathogens. They have been isolated from urinary tract infections, wounds, ear, and nosocomial bacteremic infections, often in immuncompromised patients [2-6]. P. myxofaciens has no clinical interest to this time. P. penneri as species nova was nominated by the recommendation of Hickman and co-workers [7]. Formerly it was recognized as P. vulgaris biogroup 1 or indole negative P. vulgaris [8, 9]. Although it has been less commonly isolated from clinical samples than the other three human pathogenic Proteus species, it has nevertheless been connected with infections of the urinary tract, wounds and has been isolated from the feces of both healthy and diarrheic individuals [10-12]. Potential virulence factors responsible for virulence of Proteae are: IgA protease, urease, type3 fimbriae associated with MR/K haemagglutinins of at least two antigenic types, endotoxin, swarming motility and HlyA and/or HpmA type hemolysins [for review see ref. 13]. In the followings we give a survey of accumulated concepts about the position and characteristics of HlyA type alpha-hemolysins both in general and with emphasis on virulence functions in the tribe of Proteae.
TI  - The simultaneous production of both Hly- and Hpm-like hemolysins is characteristic of the Proteus penneri species.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Proteus penneri were tested for the presence of genes encoding hemolytic activity. Strains possessing DNA sequences similar to the hlyCABD genes in Escherichia coli were found. Each secreted a 110 kDa protein which reacted with a specific anti-HlyA antiserum. Southern blotting analysis revealed that the HindIII restriction fragment pattern for the hlyCABD genes of these strains was conserved. Similarly, the chromosomal location of these genes is relatively conserved based on the pattern of NotI digested DNA fragments separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. One strain carried an additional copy of the hlyCABD determinant which was mapped on a second NotI genomic fragment. All strains contained also chromosomally encoded sequences related to the hpmBA genes originally cloned from Proteus mirabilis. All strains produced a 166 kDa exoprotein detected in immunoblots with a specific antiserum raised against HpmA hemolysin. The hpmBA genes were located on other NotI fragments than hlyCABD genes. In contrast to the other Proteae, the simultaneous production of both hemolysins seems to be a common characteristics of Proteus penneri isolates.
TI  - The prevalence of gentamicin 2'-N-acetyltransferase in the Proteeae and its role  in the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan.
AB  - The prevalence of aac(2')-Ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-N-acetyltransferase in Providencia stuartii, among species of the Proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in P. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan O-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. An evaluation of the MICs of gentamicin for each of the species of the Proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of O-acetylation of peptidoglycan. The entire aac(2')-Ia gene was used as a probe in Southern hybridization experiments against genomic DNA from each species of the Proteeae. A sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-Ia was present only in Proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also observed to the restriction digested DNA from Providencia rettgeri. Other bacteria that O-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a homologous DNA sequence was only found in Neisseria subflava. These data suggest that AAC(2')-Ia may contribute to the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan in P. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.
TI  - The production of HlyA toxin by Proteus penneri strains.
AB  - Twelve diverse strains of Proteus penneri of clinical origin all produced a calcium-dependent haemolysin, unlike most other Proteus spp. In most strains the haemolysin was secreted into the medium during early exponential growth and lysed not only of a variety of erythrocyte types from several animals including man, but also human neutrophils and human embryo lung fibroblasts. The haemolysin was a protein of 107 kDa, the same size as Escherichia coli HlyA, and it reacted with antiserum to E. coli HlyA. Because of its similarity in size, antigenicity and range of action to the HlyA virulence factor of E. coli, P. penneri HlyA is believed to be an important virulence factor for this organism. It was degradable by an EDTA-sensitive protease--probably the IgA protease--to inactive fragments. The interaction of P. penneri HlyA and IgA protease in vivo and the origin of HlyA, which has now been found in many diverse bacteria, are discussed.
TI  - Analysis of antibiotic resistance determinants in Proteus penneri.
AB  - The plasmid profiles of 65 strains of Proteus penneri were analyzed to determine  whether resistance was determined chromosomally or by plasmids. Only seven strains harboured one to three plasmids, although these strains exhibited resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. Markers for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance could be transferred to Escherichia coli by transformation. Plasmids carried resistance to chloramphenicol in two strains and resistance to sulfonamides in one strain. The result showed that resistance is determined chromosomally rather than by plasmids, however the possibility that these bacteria may acquire resistance plasmids which change their antibiotic susceptibility pattern cannot be excluded.
TI  - Cell-free and cell-bound hemolytic activities of Proteus penneri determined by different Hly determinants.
AB  - A collection of 45 Proteus penneri strains was characterized with respect to their hemolytic activity and representative cell-free or only cell-bound hemolysin possessing strains were chosen for further study. Extracellular Proteus penneri hemolysin, which was investigated earlier by hybridization, reacted with monospecific antiserum against alpha-hemolysin of Escherichia coli. In this paper we also show, using the colony hybridization technique, that the alpha-hemolysin-like determinant is widely distributed among Proteus penneri strains. Because one of the strains tested, which expressed a high activity of cell-bound hemolytic factor, did not carry such a Hly determinant, the presence of a second hemolysin is postulated. We cannot demonstrate any difference in hybridization patterns of alpha- and beta-hemolytic Proteus penneri strains and accumulation of the toxin molecule inside the cells was also not observed. The existence of another control mechanism, external to the hly operon, for hemolysin gene is suggested.
TI  - Extracellular haemolysin of Proteus penneri coded by chromosomal hly genes is similar to the alpha-haemolysin of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Extracellular haemolysin of four Proteus penneri strains was characterized as a polypeptide of approximately 110 kD. The chromosomal DNAs of these strains cleaved with Hind III showed three fragments hybridizing with a DNA probe containing cloned haemolysin (hly) genes of Escherichia coli. The results presented here suggested that the haemolysin of P. penneri strains is chromosomally determined and similar to the alpha-haemolysin of E. coli.
TI  - A survey of the aerobic bacteria in the feces of captive raptors.
AB  - Feces of 47 captive raptors belonging to the order Falconiformes or Strigiformes  were cultured for bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria, which were cultured from the feces of 45 of the 47 raptors, were the most common isolates. A wide variety of species were identified, including a newly described genus (Moellerella wisconsensis), two newly described species (Escherichia fergusonii and Proteus penneri), and a member of a newly described enteric group (CDC Enteric group 41). Additional organisms identified that have not been reported in previous bacteriological surveys of raptors were Salmonella heidelberg, Salmonella braenderup, Morganella morganii, Yersinia ruckeri, Serratia spp., and Kluyvera sp. Escherichia coli, isolated from the feces of 42 of the 47 raptors, was the most frequently recovered. Streptococcus faecalis, the second most common isolate, was cultured from 30 birds. Several differences were observed between fecal bacteria isolated from raptors fed commercially prepared chicken and those isolated from raptors not fed chicken. The most obvious difference was that birds fed chicken had more varied gram-negative bacterial species and in greater numbers per fecal sample. The potential for the isolated bacteria from raptors as pathogens in humans and avian species is discussed.
TI  - Production and properties of haemolysins from clinical isolates of the Proteeae.
AB  - A collection of 198 clinical isolates of strains belonging to the tribe Proteeae  was examined for haemolytic activity on blood agar and in Brain Heart Infusion Broth. The strains were of diverse bacteriocin and O-antigenic types and from a wide variety of sources. They included representatives of all species of Morganella, Proteus and Providencia. Approximately half of the M. morgani strains were haemolytic on blood agar. This activity was not associated with any particular bacteriocin type. The haemolysin was also produced during exponential growth in broth and was thermolabile and calcium dependent. All P. mirabilis strains and some P. vulgaris strains were non-haemolytic on blood agar. However, most strains of the Proteus spp., irrespective of their bacteriocin and antigenic type, produced, over a short period during exponential growth in broth, a heat-stable, cell-associated calcium-independent haemolysin. A smaller proportion of P. vulgaris and P. penneri strains produced, in addition, a thermolabile, calcium-dependent haemolysin which was associated with the formation of large haemolytic zones on blood agar. The relationship of these haemolysins to Escherichia coli haemolysin and their possible role in virulence is discussed. Haemolysin production was not found in any of the 74 strains of four species of Providencia.
