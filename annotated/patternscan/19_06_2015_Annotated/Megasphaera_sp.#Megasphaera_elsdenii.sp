TI  == impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production in an up-flow anaerobic  packed bed reactor (uanpbr).
AB  == this study assesses the impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production  from glucose in an up-flow anaerobic packed bed reactor (uanpbr). two mesophilic  uapbrs (uanpbr1 and 2) were tested at organic loading rates (olrs) ranging from 6.5 to 51.4 g cod l(-1)d(-1). to overcome biomass washout, design modifications were made in the uanpbr2 to include a settling zone to capture the detached biomass. the design modifications in uanpbr2 increased the average hydrogen yield from 0.98 to 2.0 mol-h2 mol(-1)-glucose at an olr of 25.7 g cod l(-1)d(-1). although, a maximum hydrogen production rate of 23.4 +/- 0.9 l h2 l(-1)d(-1) was  achieved in the uanpbr2 at an olr of 51.4 g cod l(-1)d(-1), the hydrogen yield dropped by 50% to around 1 mol-h2 mol(-1)-glucose. the microbiological analysis (pcr/dgge) showed that the biohydrogen production was due to the presence of the  hydrogen and volatile acid producers such as clostridium beijerinckii, clostridium butyricum, megasphaera elsdenii and propionispira arboris.

TI  == megasphaera indica sp. nov., an obligate anaerobic bacteria isolated from human faeces.
AB  == two coccoid, non-motile, obligately anaerobic, gram-stain-negative bacteria, occurring singly or in pairs, or as short chains, with a mean size of 1.4-2.5 microm were isolated from the faeces of two healthy human volunteers, aged 26 and 56 years, and were designated nmbhi-10(t) and blpyg-7, respectively. both the strains were affiliated to the sub-branch sporomusa of the class clostridia as revealed by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the isolates nmbhi-10(t) and blpyg-7 showed 99.1 and 99.2% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, respectively, with megasphaera elsdenii jcm 1772(t). dna-dna hybridization and phenotypic analysis showed that both the strains were distinct from their closest relative, m. elsdenii jcm 1772(t) (42 and 53% dna-dna relatedness with nmbhi-10(t) and blpyg-7, respectively), but belong to the same species (dna-dna relatedness of 80.9 % between the isolates). according to dna-dna hybridization results, the coccoid strains belong to the same genospecies, and neither is related to any of  the recognized species of the genus megasphaera. strains nmbhi-10(t) and blpyg-7  grew in pyg broth at temperatures of between 15 and 40 degrees c (optimum 37 degrees c), but not at 45 degrees c. the strains utilized a range of carbohydrates as sources of carbon and energy including glucose, lactose, cellobiose, rhamnose, galactose and sucrose. glucose fermentation resulted in the formation of volatile fatty acids, mainly caproic acid and organic acids such as  succinic acid. phylogenetic analysis, specific phenotypic characteristics and/or  dna g+c content also differentiated the strains from each other and from their closest relatives. the dna g+c contents of strains nmbhi-10(t) and blpyg-7 are 57.7 and 54.9 mol%, respectively. the major fatty acids were 12 : 0 fame and 17 : 0 cyc fame. on the basis of these data, we conclude that strains nmbhi-10(t) and  blpyg-7 should be classified as representing a novel species of the genus megasphaera, for which the name megsphaera indica sp. nov. is proposed. the type  strain is nmbhi-10(t) ( = dsm 25563(t) = mcc 2481(t)).

TI  == organic loading rate impact on biohydrogen production and microbial communities at anaerobic fluidized thermophilic bed reactors treating sugarcane stillage.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the effect of high organic loading rates (olr) (60.0-480.00 kg cod m(-3)d(-1)) on biohydrogen production at 55 degrees c, from sugarcane stillage for 15,000 and 20,000 mg codl(-1), in two anaerobic fluidized  bed reactors (afbr1 and afbr2). it was obtained, for h2 yield and content, a decreasing trend by increasing the olr. the maximum h2 yield was observed in afbr1 (2.23 mmol g cod added(-1)). the volumetric h2 production was proportionally related to the applied hydraulic retention time (hrt) of 6, 4, 2 and 1h and verified in afbr1 the highest value (1.49 l h2 h(-1)l(-1)). among the  organic acids obtained, there was a predominance of lactic acid (7.5-22.5%) and butyric acid (9.4-23.8%). the microbial population was set with hydrogen-producing fermenters (megasphaera sp.) and other organisms (lactobacillus sp.).

TI  == comparative genome analysis of megasphaera sp. reveals niche specialization and its potential role in the human gut.
AB  == with increasing number of novel bacteria being isolated from the human gut ecosystem, there is a greater need to study their role in the gut ecosystem and their effect on the host health. in the present study, we carried out in silico genome-wide analysis of two novel megasphaera sp. isolates nm10 (dsm25563) and bl7 (dsm25562), isolated from feces of two healthy individuals and validated the  key features by in vitro studies. the analysis revealed the general metabolic potential, adaptive features and the potential effects of these isolates on the host. the comparative genome analysis of the two human gut isolates nm10 and bl7  with ruminal isolate megasphaera elsdenii (dsm20460) highlighted the differential adaptive features for their survival in human gut. the key findings include features like bile resistance, presence of various sensory and regulatory systems, stress response systems, membrane transporters and resistance to antibiotics. comparison of the "glycobiome" based on the genomes of the ruminal isolate with the human gut isolates nm10 and bl revealed the presence of diverse  and unique sets of carbohydrate-active enzymes (cazymes) amongst these isolates,  with a higher collection of cazymes in the human gut isolates. this could be attributed to the difference in host diet and thereby the environment, consequently suggesting host specific adaptation in these isolates. in silico analysis of metabolic potential predicted the ability of these isolates to produce important metabolites like short chain fatty acids (butyrate, acetate, formate, and caproate), vitamins and essential amino acids, which was further validated by in vitro experiments. the ability of these isolates to produce important metabolites advocates for a potential healthy influence on the host. further in vivo studies including transcriptomic and proteomic analysis will be required for better understanding the role and impact of these megasphaera sp. isolates nm10 and bl7 on the human host.

TI  == one-pot microbial production, mechanical properties, and enzymatic degradation of isotactic p[(r)-2-hydroxybutyrate] and its copolymer with (r)-lactate.
AB  == p[(r)-2-hydroxybutyrate] [p((r)-2hb)] is an aliphatic polyester analogous to poly(lactic acid) (pla). however, little has been known for its properties because of a high cost of commercially available chiral 2hb as a starting substance for chemical polymer synthesis. in this study, p[(r)-2hb] and p[(r)-2hb-co-(r)-lactate] [p((r)-2hb-co-(r)-la)] with a new monomer combination were successfully synthesized in recombinant escherichia coli ls5218 from less-expensive racemic 2hb using an r-specific polyester synthase. the cells expressing an engineered polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase from pseudomonas sp. 61-3  and propionyl-coa transferase from megasphaera elsdenii were grown on lb medium containing 2hb and glucose in a shake flask and accumulated up to 17 wt % of p[(r)-2hb] with optical purity of >99.1%. in addition, the same cells cultured in a jar-fermentor produced p(86 mol % 2hb-co-la) copolymer. notably, the molecular  weights (mw) of p(2hb) (27000) and p(2hb-co-la) (39000) were 2- and 3-fold higher than that of p(2hb) previously synthesized by chemical polycondensation. p(2hb) was processed into a transparent film by solvent-casting and it had flexible properties with elongation at break of 173%, which was contrast to the rigid pla. regarding mechanical properties, p(2hb-co-la) was tougher but less stretchy than  p(2hb). these results demonstrated that p(2hb) has useful properties and la units in 2hb-based polymers can act as a controllable modulator of the material properties. in addition, p[(r)-2hb] was efficiently degraded by treatment of novozym 42044 (lipase) but not savinase 16l (protease), indicating that the degrading behavior of the polymer was similar to that of p[(r)-la].

TI  == correlation between composition of the bacterial community and concentration of volatile fatty acids in the rumen during the transition period and ketosis in dairy cows.
AB  == the transition period is a severe challenge to dairy cows. glucose supply cannot  meet demand and body fat is mobilized, potentially leading to negative energy balance (neb), ketosis, or fatty liver. propionate produces glucose by gluconeogenesis, which depends heavily on the number and species of microbes. in  the present study, we analyzed the rumen microbiome composition of cows in the transition period, cows with ketosis, and nonperinatal cows by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (trflp) analysis of 16s rrna genes and quantitative pcr. trflp analysis indicated that the quantity of veillonellaceae organisms was reduced and that of streptococcaceae organisms was increased in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillaceae organisms increased after calving. quantitative pcr data suggested that the numbers of the main propionate-producing microbes, megasphaera elsdenii and selenomonas ruminantium, were decreased, while numbers of the main lactate-producing bacterium, streptococcus bovis, were increased in the rumen of  cows from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillus sp. organisms increased after calving. volatile fatty acid (vfa) and glucose concentrations were decreased, but the lactic acid concentration was  increased, in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups. our results indicate that the vfa concentration is significantly related to the numbers of selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii organisms in the rumen.

TI  == biosynthesis of glycolate-based polyesters containing medium-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoates in recombinant escherichia coli expressing engineered polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase.
AB  == glycolate(gl)-based polyesters were for the first time produced in the recombinant escherichia coli fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway reinforcing mutant ls5218, using extracellularly added gl as a monomer precursor. cells expressing a ser325thr/gln481lys mutant of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase (phac1stqk) from pseudomonas sp. 61-3, propionyl-coa transferase from megasphaera elsdenii and enoyl-coa hydratase from pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on gl and dodecanoate were  found to produce novel copolymers of gl with 3-hydroxyalkanoates (3has) (c(4)-c(12)), p(gl-co-3ha), with a weight-average molecular weight of 34,000. the (1)h and (13)c nmr analyses of the copolymer revealed the incorporation of gl units into the polymer chain. this result demonstrates that phac1stqk polymerized glycolyl-coa as a monomer substrate. additionally, the novel lactate(la)-based polyester p(la-co-3ha) was produced by substituting gl with la, indicating that the method is versatile and allows the production of a variety of biopolymers.

TI  == utilization of amino acids by bacteria from the pig small intestine.
AB  == this study determined the utilization of amino acids (aa) by bacteria from the lumen of the pig small intestine. digesta samples from different segments of the  small intestine were inoculated into media containing 10 mmol/l each of select aa (l-lysine, l-threonine, l-arginine, l-glutamate, l-histidine, l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, l-proline, l-methionine, l-phenylalanine or l-tryptophan) and incubated for 24 h. the previous 24-h culture served as an inoculum for a subsequent 24-h subculture during each of 30 subcultures. results of the in vitro cultivation experiment indicated that the 24-h disappearance rates for lysine, arginine, threonine, glutamate, leucine, isoleucine, valine or histidine were 50-90% in the duodenum, jejunum or ileum groups. after 30 subcultures, the 24-h disappearance rates for lysine, threonine, arginine or glutamate remained greater than 50%. the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that streptococcus sp., mitsuokella sp., and megasphaera elsdenii-like bacteria were predominant in subcultures for utilizing lysine, threonine, arginine and glutamate. in contrast, klebsiella sp. was not a major user of arginine or glutamate. furthermore, analysis of aa composition and the incorporation of aa into polypeptides indicated that protein synthesis was a major pathway for aa metabolism in all the bacteria studied. the current work identified the possible  predominant bacterial species responsible for aa metabolism in the pig small intestine. the findings provide a new framework for future studies to characterize the metabolic fate of aa in intestinal microbes and define their nutritional significance for both animals and humans.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of some sporomusa sub-branch members isolated from human clinical specimens: description of megasphaera micronuciformis sp. nov.
AB  == two unknown, gram-negative, catalase-negative and strictly anaerobic cocci were isolated from two independent human samples (strains aip 49.01 and aip 412.00t).  comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing demonstrated that these two organisms displayed 99.8% sequence identity and that they are members of the sporomusa sub-branch of the low-g + c gram-positive bacteria. the most closely related 16s  rdna sequences were from megasphaera sp. oral clone bu057 (99.8%) and from isolates of megasphaera cerevisiae and megasphaera elsdenii (94.5 and 93.8%, respectively). phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rdna sequences showed that these two strains were most closely related to m. elsdenii and belonged to the megasphaera genus. differences from previously described megasphaera species in terms of size, biochemical tests (particularly the analysis of metabolic end products), gas production and dna g+c content indicated that the two strains studied represent a novel species of anaerobic gram-negative cocci. the name megasphaera micronuciformis sp. nov. is proposed for these two isolates. it is also proposed that the uncultured organism previously deposited as megasphaera sp. oral clone bu057 should be named 'candidatus megasphaera micronuciformis'. the type strain of megasphaera micronuciformis is aip 412.00t (=cip 107280t =ccug 45952t).

TI  == allisonella histaminiformans gen. nov., sp. nov. a novel bacterium that produces  histamine, utilizes histidine as its sole energy source, and could play a role in bovine and equine laminitis.
AB  == when cattle and horses are fed large amounts of grain, histamine can accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, and this accumulation can cause an acute inflammation of the hooves (laminitis). when ruminal fluid from dairy cattle fed  grain supplements was serially diluted in anaerobic mrs medium containing histidine (50 mm), histamine was detected at dilutions as high as 10(-7). the histidine enrichments were then transferred successively in an anaerobic, carbonate-based medium (50 mm histidine) without glucose. the histamine producing bacteria could not be isolated from the rumens of cattle fed hay; however, histamine producing bacteria could be isolated the feces of cattle fed grain and  the cecum of a horse. all of the histamine producing isolates had the same ovoid  morphology. the cells stained gram-negative and were resistant to the ionophore,  monensin (25 microm). the doubling time was 110 min, and the yield was 1.5 mg cell protein per mmol histidine. the g+c content was 46.8%. lysine was the only other amino acid used, but lysine did not allow growth if histidine was absent. because carbohydrate and organic acid utilization was not detected, it appeared that the isolates used histidine decarboxylation as their sole mechanism of energy derivation. 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that the isolates were most closely related to low g+c gram-positive bacteria (firmicutes), but similarities  were < or = 94%. because the most closely related bacteria (dialister pneumonsintes, megasphaera elsdenii and selenomonas ruminantium) did not produce  histamine from histidine, we propose that these histamine producing bacteria be assigned to a new genus, allisonella, as allisonella histaminiformans gen. nov.,  sp. nov. the type strain is mr2 (atcc baa610, dsm 15230).

TI  == effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on simulated development of ruminal lactic acidosis in vitro.
AB  == a continuous coculture of four ruminal bacteria, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, and lactobacillus sp. strain lb17,  was used to study the effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on the changes in ruminal microbial ecology that occur during the onset of lactic acidosis. in control incubations, the system simulated the development of lactic  acidosis in vivo, with an initial overgrowth of s. bovis when an excess of glucose was added to the fermentor. lactobacillus sp. strain lb17 subsequently became dominant as ph fell and lactate concentration rose. both ionophores were able to prevent the accumulation of lactic acid and maintain a healthy non-lactate-producing bacterial population when added at the same time as an excess of glucose. tetronasin was more potent in this respect than monensin. when tetronasin was added to the culture 24 h after glucose, the proliferation of lactobacilli was reversed and a non-lactate-producing bacterial population developed, with an associated drop in lactate concentration in the fermentor. rises in culture ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations accompanied these changes. monensin was unable to suppress the growth of lactobacilli; therefore, in contrast to tetronasin, monensin added 24 h after the addition of glucose failed to reverse the acidosis. numbers of lactobacilli and lactate concentrations remained high, whereas ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations were low.

TI  == transformation of mercuric chloride and methylmercury by the rumen microflora.
AB  == the microflora in strained rumen fluid did not methylate or volatilize 203hg2+ at detectable rates. however, there was an exponential decay in the concentration of added ch3hg+, which was attributed to demethylation. the major product of demethylation was metallic mercury (hg0), and it was released as a volatile product from the reaction mixture. demethylation occurred under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. the rate of demethylation was proportional to the concentration of added ch3hg+-hg from 0.02 to 100 microgram of hg per ml. the presence of hgcl2 had almost no inhibitory effect on the rate of cleavage of the  carbon-mercury bond of ch2hgcl, but it completely inhibited volatilization of the hg formed, when the concentration of hgcl2-hg reached 100 micrograms/ml. three of 11 species of anaerobic rumen bacteria catalyzed demethylation. these were desulfovibrio desulfuricans, selenomonas ruminantium, and megasphaera elsdenii. none of the 11 species caused detectable methylation, and only two caused limited volatilization of hg2+. three species of bacteria out of 90 fresh aerobic isolates from rumen contents were demethylators: two were identified as pseudomonas sp., and the third was a micrococcus sp. demethylation by the rumen microflora appeared to be carried out by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and, on the basis of hg2+ sensitivity, probably resulted from the activity of two enzymes, a ch3-hg+ hydrolase and a hg2+ reductase.

TI  == comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.
