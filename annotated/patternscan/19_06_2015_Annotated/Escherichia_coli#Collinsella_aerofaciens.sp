TI  == multi-enzymatic one-pot reduction of dehydrocholic acid to 12-keto-ursodeoxycholic acid with whole-cell biocatalysts.
AB  == ursodeoxycholic acid (udca) is a bile acid of industrial interest as it is used as an agent for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis and the medicamentous, non-surgical dissolution of gallstones. currently, it is prepared  industrially from cholic acid following a seven-step chemical procedure with an overall yield of <30%. in this study, we investigated the key enzymatic steps in  the chemo-enzymatic preparation of udca-the two-step reduction of dehydrocholic acid (dhca) to 12-keto-ursodeoxycholic acid using a mutant of 7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7beta-hsdh) from collinsella aerofaciens and  3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alpha-hsdh) from comamonas testosteroni. three different one-pot reaction approaches were investigated using whole-cell biocatalysts in simple batch processes. we applied one-biocatalyst systems, where 3alpha-hsdh, 7beta-hsdh, and either a mutant of formate dehydrogenase (fdh) from  mycobacterium vaccae n10 or a glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) from bacillus subtilis  were expressed in a escherichia coli bl21(de3) based host strain. we also investigated two-biocatalyst systems, where 3alpha-hsdh and 7beta-hsdh were expressed separately together with fdh enzymes for cofactor regeneration in two distinct e. coli hosts that were simultaneously applied in the one-pot reaction.  the best result was achieved by the one-biocatalyst system with gdh for cofactor  regeneration, which was able to completely convert 100 mm dhca to >99.5 mm 12-keto-udca within 4.5 h in a simple batch process on a liter scale.

TI  == novel whole-cell biocatalysts with recombinant hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases for  the asymmetric reduction of dehydrocholic acid.
AB  == ursodeoxycholic acid is an important pharmaceutical so far chemically synthesized from cholic acid. various biocatalytic alternatives have already been discussed with hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (hsdh) playing a crucial role. several whole-cell biocatalysts based on a 7alpha-hsdh-knockout strain of escherichia coli overexpressing a recently identified 7beta-hsdh from collinsella aerofaciens and a nad(p)-bispecific formate dehydrogenase mutant from mycobacterium vaccae for internal cofactor regeneration were designed and characterized. a strong ph dependence of the whole-cell bioreduction of dehydrocholic acid to 3,12-diketo-ursodeoxycholic acid was observed with the selected recombinant e. coli strain. in the optimal, slightly acidic ph range dehydrocholic acid is partly undissolved and forms a suspension in the aqueous solution. the batch process was optimized making use of a second-order polynomial to estimate conversion as function of initial ph, initial dehydrocholic acid concentration, and initial formate concentration. complete conversion of 72 mm dehydrocholic acid was thus made possible at ph 6.4 in a whole-cell batch process within a process time of 1 h without cofactor addition. finally, a nadh-dependent 3alpha-hsdh from comamonas testosteroni was expressed additionally in the e. coli production strain overexpressing the 7beta-hsdh and the nad(p)-bispecific formate dehydrogenase mutant. it was shown that this novel whole-cell biocatalyst was able to convert 50 mm dehydrocholic acid directly to 12-keto-ursodeoxycholic acid with the formation of only small amounts of intermediate products. this approach  may be an efficient process alternative which avoids the costly chemical epimerization at c-7 in the production of ursodeoxycholic acid.

TI  == functional metagenomics reveals novel salt tolerance loci from the human gut microbiome.
AB  == metagenomics is a powerful tool that allows for the culture-independent analysis  of complex microbial communities. one of the most complex and dense microbial ecosystems known is that of the human distal colon, with cell densities reaching  up to 10(12) per gram of faeces. with the majority of species as yet uncultured,  there are an enormous number of novel genes awaiting discovery. in the current study, we conducted a functional screen of a metagenomic library of the human gut microbiota for potential salt-tolerant clones. using transposon mutagenesis, three genes were identified from a single clone exhibiting high levels of identity to a species from the genus collinsella (closest relative being collinsella aerofaciens) (colaer_01955, colaer_01957 and colaer_01981), a high g+c, gram-positive member of the actinobacteria commonly found in the human gut.  the encoded proteins exhibit a strong similarity to gale, murb and mazg. furthermore, pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis of two additional fosmid clones revealed the presence of an additional gale and mazg gene, with the highest level of genetic identity to akkermansia muciniphila and eggerthella sp.  yy7918, respectively. cloning and heterologous expression of the genes in the osmosensitive strain, escherichia coli mkh13, resulted in increased salt tolerance of the transformed cells. it is hoped that the identification of atypical salt tolerance genes will help to further elucidate novel salt tolerance mechanisms, and will assist our increased understanding how resident bacteria cope with the osmolarity of the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  == background and aims: a general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with crohn's disease (cd), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with cd was studied in comparison with  the predominant composition in unaffected controls. whether dysbiosis is present  in relatives of patients cd was also examined. methods: focusing on families with at least three members affected with cd, faecal samples of 68 patients with cd, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient  gel electrophoresis (dgge). to analyse the dgge profiles, bionumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (spss v.17.0) were used. observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time pcr. results: five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in cd, namely a decrease in dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of clostridium cluster xiva (p = 0.03), faecalibacterium  prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). unaffected relatives of patients with cd had less collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the escherichia coli-shigella group (p = 0.01) and more ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with  healthy subjects. conclusion: unaffected relatives of patients with cd have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. this dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in cd but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.

TI  == identification, cloning, heterologous expression, and characterization of a nadph-dependent 7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from collinsella aerofaciens.
AB  == a gene encoding an nadph-dependent 7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7beta-hsdh) from collinsella aerofaciens dsm 3979 (atcc 25986, formerly eubacterium aerofaciens) was identified and cloned in this study. sequence comparison of the translated amino acid sequence suggests that the enzyme belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase superfamily. this enzyme was expressed in escherichia coli with a yield of 330 mg (5,828 u) per liter of culture. the enzyme catalyzes both the oxidation of ursodeoxycholic acid (uda) forming 7-keto-lithocholic acid (kla) and the reduction of kla forming uda acid in the presence of nadp(+) or nadph, respectively. in the presence of nadph, 7beta-hsdh  can also reduce dehydrocholic acid. sds-page and gel filtration of the expressed  and purified enzyme revealed a dimeric nature of 7beta-hsdh with a size of 30 kda for each subunit. if used for the oxidation of uda, its ph optimum is between 9 and 10 whereas for the reduction of kla and dehydrocholic acid it shows an optimum between ph 4 to 6. usage of the enzyme for the biotransformation of kla in a 0.5-g scale showed that this 7beta-hsdh is a useful biocatalyst for producing uda from suitable precursors in a preparative scale.
