TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of angelica archangelica l.  (apiaceae) roots.
AB  == in this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of angelica archangelica l. (apiaceae) roots from central italy were analyzed. the major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). the oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. a weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with mic values >4.0% v/v.

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa (apiaceae) from italy.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa l. (apiaceae) from central italy were analyzed by gc/ms. the major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). the two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and candida albicans with mic values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. a less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with mic values higher than 4.0%, v/v.

TI  == bacterial conversion of secoisolariciresinol and anhydrosecoisolariciresinol.
AB  == aims: it has been investigated whether secoisolariciresinol (seco) and anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (ahs), an acid degradation product of seco, could be  fermented in a similar way, and to a similar extent, by members of the intestinal microbiota. methods and results: ahs and seco were demethylated by peptostreptococcus productus, eubacterium limosum and clostridium methoxybenzovorans. these bacteria have been identified as members of the human intestinal flora or closely related species. demethylated ahs and demethylated seco were purified by preparative rp-hplc, and subsequently subjected to fermentation with eggerthella lenta, clostridium scindens and clostridium hiranonis. eggerthella lenta efficiently dehydroxylated demethylated seco to enterodiol, whereas the other bacteria showed no dehydroxylation activity. conclusions: the conversion of the diol structure of seco into the furan ring in  ahs did not influence the demethylation capability of the tested bacteria. the results also showed that the extent of dehydroxylation of demethylated ahs was much lower than that of demethylated seco. significance and impact of the study:  plant lignans are converted into bioactive mammalian lignans by the human intestinal bacteria. this study showed that the modification of plant lignans resulted in the formation a new type of mammalian lignan.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (trfps): a rapid, pcr-based method.
AB  == identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. we have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a 16s rrna gene fragment using a pair of universal pcr primers.  the forward pcr primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-fam)  fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the pcr products after digestion with restriction enzymes. the pcr products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an  automated dna sequencer. the data was analysed with genescan software 2.1. eleven bacteria (eubacterium biforme, e. limosum, peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, c. perfringens and escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were  successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. this protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.

TI  == pcr detection and quantitation of predominant anaerobic bacteria in human and animal fecal samples.
AB  == pcr procedures based on 16s rrna gene sequences specific for 12 anaerobic bacteria that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed and used for quantitative detection of these species in human (adult and baby) feces and animal (rat, mouse, cat, dog, monkey, and rabbit) feces. fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, and clostridium clostridiiforme had high pcr titers (the maximum dilutions for positive pcr results ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-8)) in all of the human and animal fecal samples tested. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, and eubacterium limosum also  showed higher pcr titers (10(-2) to 10(-6)) in adult human feces. the other bacteria tested, including escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, eubacterium biforme, and bacteroides distasonis, were either at low pcr titers (less than 10(-2)) or not detected by pcr. the reported pcr procedure including the fecal sample preparation method is simplified and rapid and eliminates the dna isolation steps.

TI  == biliary excretion of glutathione conjugates of 4,5-epoxy-4,5-dihydro-1- nitropyrene and 9,10-epoxy-9,10-dihydro-1-nitropyrene in rats administered 1-nitropyrene orally and their further metabolism in the intestinal tract.
AB  == 1-nitropyrene (1-np), a mutagenic and carcinogenic substance that occurs in the environment, is metabolized by reductive and oxidative pathways. 4,5-epoxy,4,5-dihydro-1-np (1-np 4,5-oxide) and 9,10-epoxy-9,10-dihydro-1-np (1-np 9,10-oxide) are oxidatively activated metabolites of 1-np, and react with glutathione. hplc analysis of biliary metabolites from rats administered [3h]1-np orally showed the presence of glutathione conjugates of 1-np 4,5-oxide and 1-np 9,10-oxide and their metabolites, cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates. during the 48 h following [3h]1-np administration, 21.4% of the biliary metabolites were excreted as glutathione, cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates of 1-np oxides. the proportions of glutathione conjugates of 1-np 4,5-oxide and 1-np 9,10-oxide were 2.6 and 10.4% respectively. bile and pancreatic juice collected from normal rats metabolized glutathione conjugates of 1-np oxides and produced the corresponding cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates. in particular, the gamma-glutamyltransferase activity of pancreatic juice was markedly high. when glutathione conjugates of 1-np oxides were incubated with a cell-free extract of small intestinal contents, they decreased rapidly and cysteine conjugates increased via cysteinylglycine conjugates, indicating that pancreatic juice plays an important role in the small intestine for the metabolism of glutathione conjugates to corresponding cysteine conjugates. although degradation activity of small intestinal contents for cysteine conjugates was very low, degradation activity of the contents of the cecum and large intestine was high and was inhibited by an inhibitor of cysteine  conjugate beta-lyase (beta-lyase) activity, aminooxyacetic acid. furthermore, the intestinal anaerobic bacteria peptostreptococcus magnus and eubacterium limosum showed high beta-lyase activity, suggesting that the cysteine conjugates might be further metabolized by beta-lyase of the normal bacterial flora in the lower intestine to the reactivated metabolites and reabsorbed.

TI  == formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == 1. microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. among them, 12 strains (mitsuokella multiacidus, clostridium perfringens, c. innocuum, c. clostiriiforme, c. difficile, c. butyricum, c. sp., eubacterium limosum, e. aerofaciens, e. multiforme, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and p. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. when clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute  structure had an (s)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric  excess.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.
