TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == in vitro activity of du-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of a new quinolone agent, du-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards-approved wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of du-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin,  metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. du-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every  group of organisms. mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis (57), other b. fragilis group species (84), bilophila wadsworthia (15), clostridium species (27) (including c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum), fusobacterium nucleatum (16), fusobacterium mortiferum-f. varium group species (10), peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and prevotella species (25).

TI  == effect of co2 on susceptibilities of anaerobes to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin.
AB  == the oxyrase agar dilution method (oxyrase, inc., mansfield, ohio), which provides an anaerobic environment without added co2, was compared with the reference agar  dilution method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (anaerobic chamber with 10% co2) to test the susceptibilities of 302 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin. for erythromycin, the overall mic for 50% of isolates tested (mic50) was 0.5 micrograms/ml and the mic90 was 8.0 micrograms/ml by the oxyrase method, whereas they were 4.0 and 64.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, under standard anaerobic conditions with co2. at a breakpoint of 4.0 micrograms/ml, 88% of strains were susceptible to erythromycin by the oxyrase method, whereas 63% were susceptible in the chamber. the corresponding mic50s and mic90s of azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin by the oxyrase method were 0.5 and 8.0, 0.25 and 4.0, and 0.5 and 16.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, whereas in the chamber they were 4.0 and > 64.0, 2.0 and 64.0, and 2.0 and 64.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. at a breakpoint of 8.0 micrograms/ml for these three drugs, 89, 92, and 85% of the isolates, respectively, were susceptible by the oxyrase method, whereas 67%, 72, and 68% of the isolates, respectively, were susceptible in the chamber. most strains resistant to all four compounds by both  methods were bacteroides distasonis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium varium and non-clostridium perfringens clostridium species. results of the study  may lead to a reappraisal of the role played by macrolides and azalides in the treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == comparison of fecal microflora of elderly persons in rural and urban areas of japan.
AB  == the fecal microflora of 15 healthy elderly persons with a median age of 84 years  in a rural area whose inhabitants tend to be long-lived (yuzurihara-area, uenohara, yamanashi prefecture) was compared with the microflora of individuals with a median age of 68 years in an urban area (tokyo). the diet of the elderly persons in the yuzurihara area is characterized by a high intake of dietary fiber. total numbers of anaerobic bacteria were significantly smaller in the elderly persons in the yuzurihara area than those in the tokyo area. a significantly large number of bifidobacteria, but not of lecithinase-negative clostridia, was observed in the elderly persons in the yuzurihara area. large numbers and high incidences of bacilli and lecithinase-positive clostridia (mainly clostridium perfringens) were found in the elderly persons in the tokyo area. twenty-five genera and over 81 species were isolated from the elderly persons in the yuzurihara area, and 25 genera and over 92 species were isolated from the elderly persons in the tokyo area. furthermore, significantly larger numbers of bifidobacterium adolescentis and fusobacterium mortiferum strains were found in the yuzurihara group, but significant reductions in the bacteroides buccae-oris group, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides spp., c. coccoides, c. paraputrificum, and clostridium spp. were observed in the same group. a significantly higher isolation rate of bacillus subtilis was observed in the elderly persons in the tokyo area. the difference in the fecal microflora between elderly persons in yuzurihara and those in the tokyo area might be due to a difference in the intake of dietary fiber.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

TI  == survival of anaerobic bacteria in common laboratory diluents.
AB  == the survival of six species of anaerobic bacteria was studied in simple or commercially available diluents. bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum showed excellent survival in all diluents including distilled water. fusobacterium mortiferum survived well in all diluents except water and water supplemented with 0.1% gelatain. clostridium perfringens survived best in phosphate-buffered saline with gelatin. peptococcus asaccharolyticus required gelatin added to the basic diluent, and streptococcus intermedius showed excellent survival only in minimal essential medium with gelatin. these diluents  could provide effective and economical alternatives to more complex and costly diluents often used in work with anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  == the susceptibility of more than 40 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. the influences of density of the inoculum upon mics was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. bacteroides fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. splanchnicus, b. oralis, b. asaccharolyticus, b. melaninogenicus, fusobacterium fusiforme (f. nucleatum), sphaerophorus necrophorus, clostridium perfringens, c.  fallax, propionibacterium acnes and several species of peptococcaceae showed broth dilution mics of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. members of b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of s. varius had a broth dilution mic  of 256 microgram/ml. with most strains, the agar dilution mics were 2 similar to  4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution mics. in pour plate-tests, the mics were  not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. with most anaerobes, the mbcs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the mics. the results obtained indicated that, apart from s. varius,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including b. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.

TI  == phosphatase activity of anaerobic organisms.
AB  == anaerobic organisms were tested for phosphatase activity in different ph ranges.  several groups of organisms displayed characteristic patterns. bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, and b. ruminicola produced phosphatase with strongest activity at ph 8.6. fusobacterium mortiferum was the only species of this genus to show strong hydrolysis. the enzyme was active in both acid and alkaline ranges. the activity of gram-positive organisms was variable, the most active groups being clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus intermedius, p. micros, and peptococcus constellatus. the incorporation of phosphatase activity into the identification scheme of anaerobes seems feasible. there was a correlation of hydrolysis with several important pathogens.
