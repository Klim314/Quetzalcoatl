TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == the effect of a multi-strain probiotic on the resistance toward escherichia coli  challenge in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention study.
AB  == background: several probiotic strains have been shown to enhance human resistance to infectious disease. it is speculated that these strains may impose this effect by excretion of anti-microbial components, by competing with pathogens for intestinal nutrients and/or mucosal adhesion sites or modulating the immune system. objective: a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week intervention was performed in healthy males, to study the effect of a blend of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11, bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum rosell-175) and a probiotic yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii cncm i-1079) on enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. primary outcomes studied were fecal etec excretion and total fecal output per day. subjects/methods: subjects were randomized to the probiotic (5 x 10(9) colony-forming units (cfus); twice daily;  n=30) or placebo group (twice daily; n=30). after 2 weeks, subjects were orally challenged with a live attenuated etec (3 x 10(9) cfu), previously demonstrated to induce mild, short-lived symptoms of a foodborne infection. before and after etec challenge, subjects collected 24 h fecal samples. compliance to study guidelines, stool consistency (bristol stool score), stool frequency, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal (gi) complaints were recorded by the subjects on a daily record questionnaire. results: etec challenge induced a significant increase in fecal etec excretion in both groups. however, a statistically significant increase in fecal output was only observed in the probiotic group. etec challenge resulted in a decrease in the percentage of fecal dry weight, and an increase in reported bristol stool score, stool frequency and  gi complaints. dietary probiotics significantly decreased the percentage of fecal dry weight. in addition, etec increased c-reactive protein, total secretory immunoglobulin a (iga) and immunoglobulin g colonization factor antigen ii. conclusion: dietary probiotics did not increase resistance to oral attenuated etec challenge in human subjects.

TI  == impact of emergency department probiotic treatment of pediatric gastroenteritis:  study protocol for the progut (probiotic regimen for outpatient gastroenteritis utility of treatment) randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background: the burden of acute gastroenteritis on children and their families continues to be enormous. probiotics, defined as viable microbial preparations that have a beneficial effect on the health of the host, represent a rapidly expanding field. although clinical trials in children with gastroenteritis have been performed, most have significant flaws, and guidelines do not consistently endorse their use. methods/design: progut is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, five-center, canadian, emergency department trial. children aged 3  months to 48 months who present between november 2013 and june 2017 with <72 hours of gastroenteritis symptoms will be assessed for eligibility. a total of 886 children will be randomized (1:1 allocation via an internet based, third party, randomization service) to receive 5 days of a combination probiotic agent  (lactobacillus rhamnosus and l. helveticus) or placebo. all participants, caregivers, and outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment. the study  includes three key outcomes: 1) clinical - the development of moderate to severe  disease following an emergency department (ed) evaluation that employs a validated clinical score (modified vesikari scale); 2) safety - side effect; and  3) mechanism - fecal secretory immunoglobulin a levels. discussion: definitive data are lacking to guide the clinical use of probiotics in children with acute gastroenteritis. hence, probiotics are rarely prescribed by north american physicians. however, the following current trends obligate an urgent assessment:  1) probiotics are sold as food supplements, and manufacturers can encourage their use while their relevance has yet to be established; 2) north american and european government agencies remain concerned about their value and safety; 3) some institutions are now recommending the routine use of probiotics; and 4) parents of affected children are often providing probiotics. with probiotic consumption increasing in the absence of solid evidence, there is a need to conduct this definitive trial to overcome the limitations of prior work in this field. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov: nct01853124; first registered 9 may 2013.

TI  == diversity and functional characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. a total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as lactobacillus pontis, and two as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. a high  genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial dna element  fingerprinting (rep-pcr) with the use of (gtg)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of l. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of l. rhamnosus. most  of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. however, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.

TI  == bacterial counts from five over-the-counter probiotics: are you getting what you  paid for?
AB  == there is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. we performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: bifidobacterium infantis (align((r))); lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and  lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) (bio-k+((r))); lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (culturelle((r))); saccharomyces boulardii (florastor((r))) and "l. acidophilus"  and "lactobacillus helveticus" (lactinex((r))). approximately 1 g of powder of each (lactinex((r)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. the florastor((r)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) cfu/g. lactinex((r)), align((r)), bio-k+((r)), and culturelle((r)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.

TI  == diversity and dynamic of lactic acid bacteria strains during aging of a long ripened hard cheese produced from raw milk and undefined natural starter.
AB  == the aim of this study was to explore diversity and dynamic of indigenous lab strains associated with a long ripened hard cheese produced from raw milk and undefined natural starter such as pdo grana padano cheese. samples of milk, curd, natural whey culture and cheeses (2nd, 6th, 9th and 13th months of ripening) were collected from 6 cheese factories in northern italy. dna was extracted from each  sample and from 194 lab isolates. trna(ala)-23s rdna-rflp was applied to identify isolates. strain diversity was assessed by (gtg)5 rep-pcr and rapd(p1)-pcr. finally, culture-independent lh-pcr (v1-v2 16s-rdna), was considered to explore structure and dynamic of the microbiota. grana padano lab were represented mainly by lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus acidilactici, while the structure and dynamic of microbiota at different localities was specific. the strength of this work is to have focused the study on isolates coming from more than one cheese factories rather than a high number of isolates  from one unique production. we provided a valuable insight into inter and intraspecies diversity of typical lab strains during ripening of traditional pdo  grana padano, contributing to the understanding of specific microbial ecosystem of this cheese.

TI  == microbial origin of non proteolytic aminoacyl derivatives in long ripened cheeses.
AB  == cheese ripening involves a complex series of biochemical events that contribute to the development of each cheese characteristic taste, aroma and texture. proteolysis, which has been the subject of active research in the last decade, is the most complex of these biochemical events. however, also aminoacyl derivates of non-proteolytic origin (gamma-glutamyl-amino acids and lactoyl-amino acids) with interesting sensory properties have been identified in cheeses. in the present work, an enzymatic activity producing gamma-glutamyl-phenylalanine in parmigiano-reggiano water soluble extracts was observed. it was hypothesized that gamma-glutamyl-amino acids and lactoyl-amino acids could be originated by enzymes of bacterial origin. in order to confirm this hypothesis, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus rhamnosus were chosen as representative of starter and non starter microbiota of parmigiano reggiano cheese. they were used as model bacteria, in the presence of suitable precursors, to verify their ability to produce gamma-glutamyl-phenylalanine and lactoyl-phenylalanine. the eventual abilities of these strains were tested both during growth and after cell lyses. while gamma-glutamyl-phenylalanine was produced only by lysed cells, lactoyl-phenylalanine was produced either by growing or lysed cells in different  amount depending on the species, the cells condition and the time of incubation.

TI  == immune signalling responses in intestinal epithelial cells exposed to pathogenic  escherichia coli and lactic acid-producing probiotics.
AB  == enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 and adherent-invasive escherichia coli are two groups of enteric bacterial pathogens associated with haemorrhagic colitis and crohn's disease, respectively. bacterial contact with host epithelial cells stimulates an immediate innate immune response designed to combat infection. in this study, immune responses of human epithelial cells to pathogens, either alone or in combination with probiotic bacteria were studied. industrially prepared lactobacillus helveticus strain r0052 was first examined by microarray analysis and then compared to broth-grown strains of r0052 and lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg using quantitative realt-time polymerase chain  reaction. results showed host immune activation responses increased following pathogen exposure, which were differentially ameliorated using probiotics depending on both the preparation of probiotics employed and conditions of exposure. these findings provide additional support for the concept that specific probiotic strains serve as a promising option for use in preventing the risk of enteric bacterial infections.

TI  == assessment of probiotic viability during cheddar cheese manufacture and ripening  using propidium monoazide-pcr quantification.
AB  == the use of a suitable food carrier such as cheese could significantly enhance probiotic viability during storage. the main goal of this study was to assess viability of commercial probiotic strains during cheddar cheesemaking and ripening (4-6 months) by comparing the efficiency of microbiological and molecular approaches. molecular methods such as quantitative pcr (qpcr) allow bacterial quantification, and dna-blocking molecules such as propidium monoazide  (pma) select only the living cells' dna. cheese samples were manufactured with a  lactococci starter and with one of three probiotic strains (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus rhamnosus ro011, or lactobacillus helveticus ro052) or a mixed culture containing b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and l. helveticus ro052 (mc1), both lactobacilli strains (mc2), or all three strains (mc3). dna extractions were then carried out on pma-treated and non-treated cell pellets in order to assess pma treatment efficiency, followed by quantification using the 16s rrna gene, the elongation factor tu gene (tuf) or the transaldolase gene (tal). results with intact/dead ratios of bacteria showed  that pma-treated cheese samples had a significantly lower bacterial count than non-treated dna samples (p < 0.005), confirming that pma did eliminate dead bacteria from pcr quantification. for both quantification methods, the addition of probiotic strains seemed to accelerate the loss of lactococci viability in comparison to control cheese samples, especially when l. helveticus ro052 was added. viability of all three probiotic strains was also significantly reduced in mixed culture cheese samples (p < 0.0001), b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 being  the most sensitive to the presence of other strains. however, all probiotic strains did retain their viability (log 9 cfu/g of cheese) throughout ripening. this study was successful in monitoring living probiotic species in cheddar cheese samples through pma-qpcr.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  == strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included lactobacillus casei/lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici. the susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in escherichia coli for comparison. analysis of l. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. e. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and  florfenicol. no extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.

TI  == probiotics are effective for the prevention and treatment of citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis in mice.
AB  == background: probiotics prevent disease induced by citrobacter rodentium, a murine-specific enteric pathogen. whether probiotics can be used to interrupt the infectious process following initiation of infection was determined. methods: c57bl/6 adult and neonatal mice were challenged with c. rodentium, and a probiotic mixture containing lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus rhamnosus was provided 1 week before bacterial challenge, concurrently with infection, or 3 days and 6 days after infection. mice were sacrificed 10 days after infection, and disease severity was assessed by histological analysis and in vivo intestinal permeability assay. inflammatory pathways and the composition of the fecal microbiome were assessed in adult mice. results: preadministration and coadministration of probiotics ameliorated c. rodentium-induced barrier dysfunction, epithelial hyperplasia, and binding of the pathogen to host colonocytes in adults, with similar findings in neonatal mice. upregulated tumor  necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma transcripts were suppressed in the pretreated probiotic group, whereas interleukin 17 transcription was suppressed with probiotics given up to 3 days after infection. probiotics promoted transcription of interleukin 10 and foxp3, and increased follicular t-regulatory  cells in pretreatment mice. c. rodentium infection resulted in an altered fecal microbiome, which was normalized with probiotic intervention. conclusions: this study provides evidence that probiotics can prevent illness and treat disease in  an animal model of infectious colitis.

TI  == a comprehensive post-market review of studies on a probiotic product containing lactobacillus helveticus r0052 and lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011.
AB  == the probiotic preparation lacidofil(r) has been commercially available in europe, asia and north america since 1995. this product is a combination of two strains,  lactobacillus helveticus r0052 and lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011. the strains have been evaluated for safety, identity and mechanisms of probiotic action in vitro, in animal models and human clinical trials. the strains adhered to human epithelial cells, helped to maintain the barrier function and blocked the adhesion of a number of pathogens, allowing them to be cleared from the intestine. the strains also elicited an anti-inflammatory response by down-regulating il-1beta, il-8 and tnf-alpha. in various stress models, the probiotic combination facilitated better coping and outcomes which may be through the maintenance of barrier function and suppressing inflammation. overall, pre-clinical studies suggest a potential anti-infectious role for the strains and the combination. clinical studies, primarily in children, have identified lacidofil as an effective supplement for various gastrointestinal diseases such as antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and acute gastroenteritis. recent research has also indicated that lacidofil may be beneficial for individuals with atopic dermatitis or vaginal dysbacteriosis.

TI  == the impact of meals on a probiotic during transit through a model of the human upper gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == commercial literature on various probiotic products suggests that they can be taken before meals, during meals or after meals or even without meals. this has led to serious confusion for the industry and the consumer. the objective of our  study was to examine the impact of the time of administration with respect to mealtime and the impact of the buffering capacity of the food on the survival of  probiotic microbes during gastrointestinal transit. we used an in vitro digestive system (ividis) model of the upper gastrointestinal tract to examine the survival of a commercial multi-strain probiotic, protecflor(r). this product, in a capsule form, contains four different microbes: two lactobacilli (lactobacillus helveticus r0052 and lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011), bifidobacterium longum r0175 and saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii. enumeration during and after transit of the stomach and duodenal models showed that survival of all the bacteria in the product was best when given with a meal or 30 minutes before a meal (cooked oatmeal with milk). probiotics given 30 minutes after the meal did not survive in high numbers. survival in milk with 1% milk fat and oatmeal-milk gruel were significantly better than apple juice or spring water. s. boulardii was not affected by time of meal or the buffering capacity of the meal. the protein content of the meal was probably not as important for the survival of the bacteria as the fat content. we conclude that ideally, non-enteric coated bacterial probiotic products should be taken with or just prior to a meal containing some fats.

TI  == the spatial distribution of bacteria in grana-cheese during ripening.
AB  == the microbial composition and its spatial distribution of grana trentino, a hard  parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. after cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the cheese rind, an intermediate section and  the cheese core. after two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic  bacterial counts. thermophilic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus) were found in  high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. after 9 months of  ripening, lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts were higher than those after 18 months. furthermore, the lab numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. the main lab species isolated from milk (lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, streptococcus uberis and lactococcus garvieae) were not found in the corresponding cheeses. some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of lab. in each sample, all lab were genotypically grouped and the different biotypes were subjected to several technological tests indicating that some non-starter lab (nslab) displayed technological features that are favorable for the production of grana trentino cheese.

TI  == [genetic diversity of the genus lactobacillus bacteria from the human gastrointestinal microbiome].
AB  == the species and strain genetic diversity of bacterial cultures belonging to the genus lactobacillus, which were isolated from the gastrointestinal microbiome of  the human population living in the former soviet union in the years 1960-1980, was studied. the bacteria demonstrated probiotic characteristics. phylogenetic analysis of sequences of the gene coding for 16s rrna detected earlier by us, showed that the gene found in bacteria isolated from the intestinal content of healthy adults and represented by species l. plantarum, l. helveticus, l. casei/paracasei, l. rhamnosus, and l. fermentum has high homology (97-100%) with  this gene in type representatives of the species. the genotypic and strain diversity of cultures was studied using rapd-pcr and nonspecific primers. this method with the use of the eric-1 primer gave reliable and reproducible results as compared that using with m13 and msp primers and allowed the identification of examined bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus at the level of species and certification at the strain level.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == probiotic colonization of the adherent mucus layer of ht29mtxe12 cells attenuates campylobacter jejuni virulence properties.
AB  == the ht29mtxe12 (e12) cell line harbors an adherent mucus layer, providing a novel technique to model mucosal infection in vitro. in this study, we have characterized the interaction of campylobacter jejuni with the e12 cell line and  exploited its unique mucus layer to examine the potential efficacy of probiotic treatment to attenuate c. jejuni virulence properties. c. jejuni 81-176 colonized and reproduced in e12 mucus. adhesion to and internalization of c. jejuni were enhanced in e12 cells harboring mucus compared to parental cells without mucus. translocation of c. jejuni occurred at early time points following infection. c.  jejuni aligned with tight junctions and colocalized with the tight junction protein occludin, suggesting a paracellular route of translocation. probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011, lactobacillus helveticus r0052, lactobacillus salivarius ah102, bifidobacterium longum ah1205, a commercial combination of l. rhamnosus r0011 and l. helveticus r0052 (lacidofil), and a cocktail consisting of l. rhamnosus, l. helveticus, and l. salivarius (rhhesa) colonized e12 mucus and bound to underlying cells. probiotics attenuated c. jejuni association with and internalization into e12 cells and translocation to the basolateral medium of transwells. live bacteria and prolonged precolonization of e12 cells with probiotics were necessary for probiotic action. these results demonstrate the potential for e12 cells as a model of mucosal pathogenesis and provide a rationale for the further investigation of probiotics as prophylaxis against human campylobacteriosis.

AB  == background: intestinal bacterial infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in neonates. therefore, the aims of this study were to characterize citrobacter rodentium infection in neonatal mice and determine the role played by specific probiotics in ameliorating disease severity. methods: infection of c57bl/6 mice with c. rodentium was performed at postnatal day 14. a  subset of mice was pretreated orally with either a mixture of lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus helveticus or placebo, starting at 7 days. to study the effects of b and t cells, rag1(-/-) and jh(-/-) mice were used, with survival, colonic crypt depth, and barrier function evaluated as outcome measures. results: c. rodentium infection caused weight loss and death. in contrast, survival was maintained by daily treatment with lactobacilli. weight loss, colonic epithelial cell hyperplasia, mucosal barrier dysfunction, and elevated serum corticosterone levels in c. rodentium-infected wild-type mice were ameliorated by probiotics, but not in rag1(-/-) animals. beneficial effects of probiotics were observed in b cell-deficient (jh(-/-)) mice, indicating the requirement of t cells in reducing the adverse sequelae of neonatal enteric infection. conclusions: these findings demonstrate that c. rodentium infection in newborn mice causes death and that probiotics promote survival, but only in the presence of t cells.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli isolated from two italian hard cheeses.
AB  == one hundred forty-one lactobacilli strains isolated from natural whey starter cultures and ripened grana padano and parmigiano reggiano cheeses were tested for their susceptibility to 13 antibiotics, in particular, penicillin g, ampicillin,  amoxicillin, oxacillin, cephalotin, cefuroxime, vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, and nitrofurantoin. the  strains belonged to the species lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. casei. the strains of the first two species were isolated from whey starter cultures, and the strains of the last two species were from the ripened cheeses. significant differences among the strains in their antibiotic resistance were found in relation to the type of cheese and, especially, the strains from parmigiano reggiano were more resistant to gentamicin and penicillin g. the strains isolated in the ripened cheese were generally more resistant than those isolated from natural whey starter cultures;  in particular, significant differences regarding oxacillin, vancomycin, cephalotin, and co-trimoxazole were observed. finally, no significant difference  in relation to the type of cheese was found among the thermophilic lactobacilli isolated from whey cultures, while the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli isolated from parmigiano reggiano showed higher resistance toward gentamicin and penicillin g than did the same species isolated from grana padano.

TI  == strain-specific probiotic (lactobacillus helveticus) inhibition of campylobacter  jejuni invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is the most common bacterial cause of enterocolitis in humans, leading to diarrhoea and chronic extraintestinal diseases. although probiotics are effective in preventing other enteric infections, beneficial microorganisms have not been extensively studied with c. jejuni. the aim of this  study was to delineate the ability of selected probiotic lactobacillus strains to reduce epithelial cell invasion by c. jejuni. human colon t84 and embryonic intestine 407 epithelial cells were pretreated with lactobacillus strains and then infected with two prototypic c. jejuni pathogens. lactobacillus helveticus,  strain r0052 reduced c. jejuni invasion into t84 cells by 35-41%, whereas lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011 did not reduce pathogen invasion. lactobacillus helveticus r0052 also decreased invasion of one c. jejuni isolate (strain 11168)  into intestine 407 cells by 55%. lactobacillus helveticus r0052 adhered to both epithelial cell types, which suggest that competitive exclusion could contribute  to protection by probiotics. taken together, these findings indicate that the ability of selected probiotics to prevent c. jejuni-mediated disease pathogenesis depends on the pathogen strain, probiotic strain and the epithelial cell type selected. the data support the concept of probiotic strain selectivity, which is  dependent on the setting in which it is being evaluated and tested.

TI  == probiotics prevent enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7-mediated inhibition of interferon-gamma-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of stat-1.
AB  == enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h7 inhibits interferon (ifn)-gamma-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat)-1 in epithelial cells. we determined the effects of probiotics on ehec-mediated disruption of ifn-gamma-stimulated stat-1  activation in epithelial cell lines. confluent intestine 407, hep-2 and caco-2 epithelial cells were pre-treated (3 h) with either probiotics or surface-layer proteins derived from lactobacillus helveticus r0052 prior to infection with ehec o157:h7 strain cl56 (m.o.i. 100:1, 6 h, 37 degrees c in 5% co2). subsequently, cells were washed and stimulated with human recombinant ifn-gamma (50 ng ml(-1),  0.5 h, 37 degrees c) followed by whole-cell protein extraction and immunoblotting for tyrosine-phosphorylated stat-1. relative to uninfected cells, stat-1-activation was reduced after ehec o157:h7 infection. pre-incubation with the probiotic l. helveticus r0052 followed by ehec infection abrogated pathogen-mediated disruption of ifn-gamma-stat-1 signalling. as determined using  transwell inserts, probiotic-mediated protection was independent of epithelial cell contact. in contrast, pre-incubation with boiled l. helveticus r0052, an equal concentration of viable lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011, or surface-layer proteins (0.14 mg ml(-1)) did not restore stat-1 signalling in ehec-infected cells. the viable probiotic agent l. helveticus r0052 prevented ehec o157:h7-mediated subversion of epithelial cell signal transduction responses.

TI  == effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of supplemented copper (cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture. methods and results: thirteen strains belonging to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus or propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various  copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and ph measurements, also by platings. among the species considered, l. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and s. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. anaerobic conditions  increased this sensitivity significantly. there was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. conclusions: copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. in addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for emmental cheese manufacture.

TI  == the role of luminal factors in the recovery of gastric function and behavioral changes after chronic helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == the role of chronic infections, such as helicobacter pylori (hp), to produce sustained changes in host physiology remains controversial. in this study, we investigate whether the antigenic or bacterial content of the gut, after hp eradication, influences the changes in gut function induced by chronic hp infection. mice were infected with hp for 4 mo and then treated with antibiotics  or placebo for 2 wk. gastric emptying was measured using videofluoroscopy, feeding behavior using a 24-h feeding system, and intestinal permeability using an isolated jejunal segment arterially perfused with an artificial oxygen carrier, hemoglobin vesicles. immune responses were assessed by cd3(+) cell counts and anti-hp antibodies using elisa. to determine the role of luminal factors in host physiology posteradication, groups of mice received the probiotics containing lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011 and l. helveticus r0052 or placebo for 2 wk or crude hp antigen weekly for 2 mo. chronic hp infection was associated with delayed gastric emptying, increased intestinal permeability, and  increased gastric cd3(+) cell counts. hp-induced altered feeding patterns did not reverse after eradication. probiotics accelerated the recovery of paracellular permeability and delayed gastric emptying, improved the cd3(+) cell counts, and normalized altered feeding patterns posteradication. hp antigen resulted in increased anti-hp antibodies and increased cd3(+) cell counts in the stomach and  delayed recovery of gastric function. our results suggest that the bacterial content of the gut, as well as the presence of relevant antigens, influences the  rate of recovery of host pathophysiology induced by chronic hp infection. these changes do not seem to occur in association with modulation of intestinal permeability.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == probiotics prevent bacterial translocation and improve intestinal barrier function in rats following chronic psychological stress.
AB  == background and aims: chronic psychological stress, including water avoidance stress (was), induces intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction and impairs mucosal  defences against luminal bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the ability of a defined probiotic regimen to prevent was induced intestinal pathophysiology. methods: male rats were subjected to either was or sham stress for one hour per day for 10 consecutive days. additional animals received seven days of lactobacillus helveticus and l rhamnosus in the drinking water prior to stress and remained on these probiotics for the duration of the study. rats were  then sacrificed, intestinal segments assessed in ussing chambers, and mesenteric  lymph nodes cultured to determine bacterial translocation. results: all animals remained healthy for the duration of the study. chronic was induced excess ion secretion (elevated baseline short circuit current) and barrier dysfunction (increased conductance) in both the ileum and colon, associated with increased bacterial adhesion and penetration into surface epithelial cells. approximately 70% of rats subjected to was had bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes while there was no bacterial translocation in controls. probiotic pretreatment alone had no effect on intestinal barrier function. however, was induced increased ileal short circuit current was reduced with probiotics whereas there was no impact on altered conductance. pretreatment of animals with probiotics also completely abrogated was induced bacterial adhesion and prevented translocation of bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes. conclusion: these findings indicate that probiotics can prevent chronic stress induced intestinal abnormalities and, thereby, exert beneficial effects in the intestinal tract.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactobacillus helveticus pepo2, an endopeptidase with post-proline specificity.
AB  == a post-proline endopeptidase (pepo2) was detected in cell extracts from a genomic library of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 by using the synthetic substrate n-acetyl-beta-casein-(f203-209)-rho-nitroanilide in a coupled reaction with aminopeptidase n. isolates with activity for this substrate contained plasmids with visually indistinguishable restriction profiles. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 1,947-bp open reading frame, designated pepo2, encoding a putative 71.4-kda protein. analysis of the predicted peptide sequence revealed that l. helveticus pepo2 contained the zinc-dependent metalloprotease motif hexxh and exhibited levels of amino acid sequence similarity of 72, 61, 59, and 53% to  l. helveticus pepo, lactococcus lactis pepo2, l. lactis pepo, and lactobacillus rhamnosus pepo, respectively. northern hybridization results indicated that the transcript containing pepo2 was monocistronic. despite the high degrees of amino  acid similarity to pepo proteins from other lactic acid bacteria, the specificity of the l. helveticus pepo2 for post-proline bonds distinguishes it from other pepo-type endopeptidases characterized to date. the specificity for post-proline  bonds also suggests that this enzyme may play a central role in the hydrolysis of casein-derived bitter peptides, such as beta-casein(f193-209).

TI  == food-grade host/vector expression system for lactobacillus casei based on complementation of plasmid-associated phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg.
AB  == a new food-grade host/vector system for lactobacillus casei based on lactose selection was constructed. the wild-type non-starter host lb. casei strain e utilizes lactose via a plasmid-encoded phosphotransferase system. for food-grade  cloning, a stable lactose-deficient mutant was constructed by deleting a 141-bp fragment from the phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg via gene replacement. the  deletion resulted in an inactive phospho-beta-galactosidase enzyme with an internal in-frame deletion of 47 amino acids. a complementation plasmid was constructed containing a replicon from lactococcus lactis, the lacg gene from lb. casei, and the constitutive promoter of pepr for lacg expression from lb. rhamnosus. the expression of the lacg gene from the resulting food-grade plasmid  pleb600 restored the ability of the lactose-negative mutant strain to grow on lactose to the wild-type level. the vector pleb600 was used for expression of the proline iminopeptidase gene pepi from lb. helveticus in lb. casei. the results show that the food-grade expression system reported in this paper can be used for expression of foreign genes in lb. casei.

TI  == x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepx) is part of the glnra operon in lactobacillus rhamnosus.

AB  == the evolution of the microflora of three comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. the same starter  was used with each type of milk. the comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. starter lactic acid  bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. other microorganisms, i.e.  homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. the characterization of strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. the  values for the genome size of 11 strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 mbp. the potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.
