TI  - Detection of bacterial contamination in cultures of eucaryotic cells by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  - The use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for early detection of bacterial  contaminations in cultures of baker's yeast, Penicillium chrysogenum, and an animal cell line was evaluated; muramic acid and characteristic cellular fatty acids were used as analytes. By analyzing branched-chain and cyclopropane-substituted fatty acids as methyl esters, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas fluorescens were detected in a 500-fold excess (w/w) of baker's yeast; the amounts injected corresponded to 300 ng (dry mass) of the bacteria. Contamination with Bacillus was detected in cultures of Penicillium chrysogenum and animal cells by analyzing muramic acid, both as its alditol acetate derivative, using electron impact ionization, and its trifluoroacetyl methyl glycoside derivative, using negative ion-chemical ionization. The trifluoroacetylated derivative was detected in injected amounts corresponding to 1 x 10(3) bacterial cells in the contaminated animal cell line, whereas amounts corresponding to 1 x 10(5) bacteria were required for detection of the alditol acetate derivative; the amounts in the original samples were 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(6), respectively. However, the alditol acetate method exhibited lower chemical interferences than the trifluoroacetyl methyl glycoside procedure. The results show the potential of using gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of cellular constituents for the detection of bacterial contaminations in eucaryotic cultures as an alternative to conventional microbiological methods.
