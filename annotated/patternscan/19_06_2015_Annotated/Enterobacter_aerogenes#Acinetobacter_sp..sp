TI  == ndm-1 encoded by a pndm-bj01-like plasmid p3sp-ndm in clinical enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == a carbapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacter aerogenes strain named 3-sp was isolated from a human case of pneumonia in a chinese teaching hospital. ndm-1 carbapenemase is produced by a pndm-bj01-like conjugative plasmid designated p3sp-ndm to account for carbapenem resistance of 3-sp. p3sp-ndm was fully sequenced and compared with all publically available pndm-bj01-like plasmids. the genetic differences between p3sp-ndm and pndm-bj01 include only 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms, a 1 bp deletion and a 706 bp deletion. p3sp-ndm and pndm-bj01 harbor an identical tn125 element organized as isaba125, bla ndm-1, ble mbl, deltatrpf, dsbc, cuta, deltagroes, groel, iscr27, and isaba125. the bla ndm-1 surrounding regions in these pndm-bj01-like plasmids have a conserved linear organization isaba14-apha6-tn125-unknown is, with considerable genetic differences identified within or immediately downstream of tn125. all reported pndm-bj01-like plasmids are exclusively found in acinetobacter, whereas this is the first report of identification of a pndm-bj01-like plasmid in enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  == in this paper, the production of humic substances (hs) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (lrc) was evaluated. the evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. the biotransformed lrc and the hs produced were quantified in vitro  in a liquid growth medium. the humic acids (ha) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (c, h, n, o), ir analyses, and the e4/e6 ratio; they were then compared with the ha extracted chemically using naoh. there was lrc biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and hs production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . l(-1). more activity was detected in the isolated strains of bacillus mycoides, microbacterium sp, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter aerogenes. the ha produced by b. mycoides had an ir spectrum and an e4/e6 ratio similar to those of the ha extracted with naoh, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the lrc resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce hs in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == isolation and identification of chromium-resistant bacteria: test application for prevention of chromium toxicity in plant.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to isolate chromium resistant bacteria and characterize in depth before being applied for bioremediation or construction of  chromium biosesnors. one of the major objectives was to identify the most useful  strains with respect to chromium removal efficiency. chromium resistant bacteria  were isolated from tannery waste samples. these were characterized through biochemical tests and antibiotic assays. cross metal reactivity, plasmid curing and cysteine quantifications were also performed. gene sequencing was done for all the isolates and accession numbers received after submission to national center for biotechnology information (ncbi). the removal capacity was also studied in broth cultures. the results were very encouraging since six new bacteria were recognised to withstand high concentrations of chromium. out of these six bacteria, three i.e. enterobacter aerogenes, aeromonas sp., acinetobacter sp. pd 12 performed very well by removing about 99% (average) from  initial 19.8 ppm of cr(vi) from a synthetic culture media. enterobacter aerogenes, being the most efficient strain, was used to remediate hexavalent chromium from soil of potted plants- very encouraging results were obtained. these bacteria may be exploited for bioremediation of cr (vi) and construction of microbial sensor in future.

TI  == bioremediation of chromium by novel strains enterobacter aerogenes t2 and acinetobacter sp. pd 12 s2.
AB  == purpose: this study had an objective to identify the most potent chromium-resistant bacteria isolated from tannery effluent and apply them for bioremediation of chromium in tannery effluents. methods: two such strains (previously characterized and identified by us)--enterobacter aerogenes (ncbi genbank usa accession no. gu265554) and acinetobacter sp. pd 12 (ncbi genbank usa accession no. gu084179)--showed powerful chromium resistivity and bioremediation  capabilities among many stains isolated from tannery waste. parameters such as ph, concentration of hexavalent chromium or cr (vi), and inoculum volume were varied to observe optimum bioconversion and bioaccumulation of cr (vi) when the said strains were grown in m9 minimal salt media. e. aerogenes was used to remediate chromium from tannery effluents in a laboratory level experiment. results: observation by scanning electron microscope and chromium peak in energy  dispersive x-ray spectroscopic microanalysis revealed that e. aerogenes helped remediate a moderate amount of cr (vi) (8-16 mg l(-1)) over a wide range of ph values at 35-37 degrees c (within 26.05 h). high inoculum percentage of acinetobacter sp. pd 12 also enabled bioremediation of 8-16 mg l(-1) of cr (vi) over a wide range of temperature (25-37 degrees c), mainly at ph 7 (within 63.28  h). the experiment with real tannery effluent gave very encouraging results. conclusion: the strain e. aerogenes can be used in bioremediation of cr (vi) since it could work in actual environmental conditions with extraordinarily high  capacity.

TI  == potential application of the nisin z preparation of lactococcus lactis w8 in preservation of milk.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

TI  == [in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpirome compared to other broad-spectrum beta-lactam drugs against 804 clinical isolates from 9 brazilian hospitals].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro activity of the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefpirome in comparison to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and imipenem in a multicenter study involving nine hospitals from six  cities (four states). material and method: a total of 804 isolates from patients  hospitalized in either intensive care units or oncology/hematology units was evaluated. the isolates were collected between june and november of 1995, i.e. before cefpirome became commercially available in brazil, and susceptibility tested by broth microdilution following the nccls procedures. all isolates resistant to cefpirome were retested by e-test. results: against enterobacteriaceae (n = 344), cefpirome demonstrated an activity 2 to 32-fold higher than that of the third-generation cephalosporins (tgcs) and similar to that of imipenem. the percentages of enterobacteriaceae susceptible were: 88%, 69% and 96% for cefpirome, tgcs and imipenem, respectively. the cefpirome spectrum was greater or equal than that of imipenem against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, morganella morganii and serratia marcescens. against acinetobacter sp. (n = 77), cefpirome was slightly more active than ceftazidime;  however, the percentages of isolates resistant to these compounds were high (84%  and 88%, respectively). the activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime and imipenem were very similar against p. aeruginosa isolates (n = 128), with mic50(mg/ml)/percent susceptible of 8/59%, 8/62% and 4/62% respectively. against  aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the cefpirome activity was 4 to 16-fold higher than that of tgcs but 2 to 8-fold lower than that of imipenem. conclusion: the results suggest that, in brazil, cefpirome has a spectrum of activity which is higher than that of the tgcs against aerobic gram-negative (enterobacteriaceae and non-enterobacteriaceae) and gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of imipenem against some enterobacteriaceae species and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (clms). the leakage of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., bacillus sp., a coryneform, staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (enterobacter cloacae nc1b 8151 and ent. aerogenes mb31) was studied. the rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm hg  than at atmospheric pressure. fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). the number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. the effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. cells from biofilms and monolayers of ac. calcoaceticus or staph. aureus attached to nylon (hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. the composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. the results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.

AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == bacterial growth rates and competition affect nodulation and root colonization by rhizobium meliloti.
AB  == the addition of streptomycin to nonsterile soil suppressed the numbers of bacterial cells in the rhizosphere of alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) for several days, resulted in the enhanced growth of a streptomycin-resistant strain of rhizobium meliloti, and increased the numbers of nodules on the alfalfa roots. a  bacterial mixture inoculated into sterile soil inhibited the colonization of alfalfa roots by r. meliloti, caused a diminution in the number of nodules, and reduced plant growth. enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas marginalis, acinetobacter sp., and klebsiella pneumoniae suppressed the colonization by r. meliloti of roots grown on agar and reduced nodulation by r. meliloti, the suppression of nodulation being statistically significant for the first three species. bradyrhizobium sp. and "sarcina lutea" did not suppress root colonization nor nodulation by r. meliloti. the doubling times in the rhizosphere for e. aerogenes, p. marginalis, acinetobacter sp., and k. pneumoniae were less and the doubling times for bradyrhizobium sp. and "s. lutea" were greater than the doubling time of r. meliloti. under the same conditions, arthrobacter citreus injured alfalfa roots. we suggest that competition by soil bacteria reduces nodulation by rhizobia in soil and that the extent of inhibition is related to the growth rates of the rhizosphere bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.
