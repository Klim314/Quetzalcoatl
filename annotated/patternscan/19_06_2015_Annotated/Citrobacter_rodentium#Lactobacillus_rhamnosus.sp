TI  == probiotics are effective for the prevention and treatment of citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis in mice.
AB  == background: probiotics prevent disease induced by citrobacter rodentium, a murine-specific enteric pathogen. whether probiotics can be used to interrupt the infectious process following initiation of infection was determined. methods: c57bl/6 adult and neonatal mice were challenged with c. rodentium, and a probiotic mixture containing lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus rhamnosus was provided 1 week before bacterial challenge, concurrently with infection, or 3 days and 6 days after infection. mice were sacrificed 10 days after infection, and disease severity was assessed by histological analysis and in vivo intestinal permeability assay. inflammatory pathways and the composition of the fecal microbiome were assessed in adult mice. results: preadministration and coadministration of probiotics ameliorated c. rodentium-induced barrier dysfunction, epithelial hyperplasia, and binding of the pathogen to host colonocytes in adults, with similar findings in neonatal mice. upregulated tumor  necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma transcripts were suppressed in the pretreated probiotic group, whereas interleukin 17 transcription was suppressed with probiotics given up to 3 days after infection. probiotics promoted transcription of interleukin 10 and foxp3, and increased follicular t-regulatory  cells in pretreatment mice. c. rodentium infection resulted in an altered fecal microbiome, which was normalized with probiotic intervention. conclusions: this study provides evidence that probiotics can prevent illness and treat disease in  an animal model of infectious colitis.

TI  == probiotics prevent death caused by citrobacter rodentium infection in neonatal mice.
AB  == background: intestinal bacterial infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in neonates. therefore, the aims of this study were to characterize citrobacter rodentium infection in neonatal mice and determine the role played by specific probiotics in ameliorating disease severity. methods: infection of c57bl/6 mice with c. rodentium was performed at postnatal day 14. a  subset of mice was pretreated orally with either a mixture of lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus helveticus or placebo, starting at 7 days. to study the effects of b and t cells, rag1(-/-) and jh(-/-) mice were used, with survival, colonic crypt depth, and barrier function evaluated as outcome measures. results: c. rodentium infection caused weight loss and death. in contrast, survival was maintained by daily treatment with lactobacilli. weight loss, colonic epithelial cell hyperplasia, mucosal barrier dysfunction, and elevated serum corticosterone levels in c. rodentium-infected wild-type mice were ameliorated by probiotics, but not in rag1(-/-) animals. beneficial effects of probiotics were observed in b cell-deficient (jh(-/-)) mice, indicating the requirement of t cells in reducing the adverse sequelae of neonatal enteric infection. conclusions: these findings demonstrate that c. rodentium infection in newborn mice causes death and that probiotics promote survival, but only in the presence of t cells.

TI  == amelioration of the effects of citrobacter rodentium infection in mice by pretreatment with probiotics.
AB  == background: citrobacter rodentium is a naturally occurring murine pathogen that causes colonic epithelial-cell hyperplasia, disrupts the colonic mucosa, and elicits a predominantly t helper 1 cellular immune response; it thereby serves as a model for the study of mechanisms of disease induced by human attaching-effacing pathogens. we sought to determine whether pretreatment of mice with a mixture of lactobacillus rhamnosus and l. acidophilus probiotics would attenuate c. rodentium-induced colonic disease in mice. methods: mice were administered sterile drinking water, probiotics (10(9) cfu/ml) in sterile drinking water, maltodextrin in sterile drinking water, orogastric c. rodentium (10(7) cfu in 0.1 ml), or maltodextrin in sterile drinking water for 1 week before c. rodentium infection, or they were pretreated with probiotics (10(9) cfu/ml) for 1 week before challenge with c. rodentium. results: mice that received viable probiotics remained healthy. c. rodentium infection elicited mucosal inflammation, epithelial-cell hyperplasia, apoptosis in the colon, and interferon (ifn)- gamma production by splenocytes. pretreatment with probiotics decreased levels of all but ifn- gamma production. conclusions: pretreatment with probiotics attenuates the effects of c. rodentium infection in mice. understanding the mechanism of these beneficial effects will aid in determining the efficacy of probiotics in preventing infection with related attaching-effacing enteric pathogens in humans.
