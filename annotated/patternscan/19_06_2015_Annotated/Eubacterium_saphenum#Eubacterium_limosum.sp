TI  == description of mogibacterium pumilum gen. nov., sp. nov. and mogibacterium vescum gen. nov., sp. nov., and reclassification of eubacterium timidum (holdeman et al. 1980) as mogibacterium timidum gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == a new genus, mogibacterium, is proposed for anaerobic, non-spore-forming, gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria which have been isolated from the periodontal  pockets of adult human patients with periodontal disease and infected root canals. the novel isolates, strains d2-18t, ba11a-f and d5-2t, were inert in most of the conventional biochemical tests and phenotypically resemble asaccharolytic  eubacterium species. the protein profiles of whole cells on sds-page gels and western immunoblotting reaction analysis distinguished these organisms from type  strains belonging to the previously described eubacterium species. the g + c content of the dna is 45-46 mol% for mogibacterium pumilum and 46 mol% for mogibacterium vescum. the levels of dna-dna relatedness of these new species to other eubacterium species, including eubacterium limosum, eubacterium brachy, eubacterium lentum, eubacterium nodatum, eubacterium saphenum, and the more recently proposed eubacterium minutum and eubacterium exiguum (reclassified as slackia exigua), are less than 2%. the dna-dna hybridization value between m. pumilum and m. vescum was 30%. eubacterium timidum exhibited dna homologies with  mogibacterium species which were low (17 and 18%) but clearly higher than with all the other eubacterium species. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences revealed that the closest phylogenetic neighbour of mogibacterium species was e. timidum, and that these three species represent a novel lineage distinct from the previously described genera of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. on the basis of phenotypic characteristics and 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons, it is also proposed that e. timidum is transferred to the genus mogibacterium gen. nov. as mogibacterium timidum gen. nov., comb. nov. (type strain atcc 33093t).

TI  == cryptobacterium curtum gen. nov., sp. nov., a new genus of gram-positive anaerobic rod isolated from human oral cavities.
AB  == novel eubacterium-like isolates, strains 12-3t and kv43-b, which were isolated from the periodontal pocket of an adult patient with periodontal disease and necrotic dental pulp, respectively, were studied taxonomically and phylogenetically. the morphological and differential biochemical characteristics  of these organisms are also described in this paper. these organisms were gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria that were inert  in most of the conventional biochemical tests and closely resembled members of asaccharolytic oral eubacterium species. on the other hand, protein profiles of whole cells in sds-page and western immunoblotting reaction analysis distinguished these isolates from strains of the previously described genus eubacterium. the g+c content of the dnas from the novel isolates was 50 and 51 mol%, respectively. the levels of dna-dna relatedness to other asaccharolytic oral eubacterium species, including eubacterium brachy, eubacterium lentum, eubacterium nodatum, eubacterium timidum, eubacterium saphenum, eubacterium minutum and eubacterium exiguum, was less than 11%. these organisms also exhibited a very low level of reassociation with the dna of eubacterium limosum,  the type species of the genus eubacterium. the results of 16s rdna sequence comparisons revealed that these organisms represent a novel lineage distinct from all previously described genera of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. on the basis of our results, it is suggested that strains 12-3t and kv43-b should be classified in a new genus and species, for which the name cryptobacterium curtum  gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of cryptobacterium curtum is 12-3t (= atcc 700683t).

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.
