TI  - Haemophilus segnis polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16S  ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.
AB  - This paper reports a case of Haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of H. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. In the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with Streptococcus intermedius and S. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. In the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with Clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. Both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress C in air with CO2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. Both strains were factor V-dependent, but not factor X-dependent. For the first isolate, the Vitek system (NHI) showed that it was 56% likely to be Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% Neisseria subflava; whereas the API system (NH) showed that it was 58% likely to be H. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% H. parainfluenzae. For the second isolate, the Vitek system (NHI) showed that it was 95% likely to be H. influenzae VIII; whereas the API system (NH) showed that it was 58% likely to be H. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% H. parainfluenzae. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and H. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and H. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of H. segnis. Only two cases of H. segnis bacteraemia were found in the English scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. Including the present two cases, the overall mortality of H. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
