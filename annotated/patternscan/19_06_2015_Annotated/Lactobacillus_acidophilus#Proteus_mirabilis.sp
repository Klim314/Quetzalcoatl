TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == [antagonistic effect of bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus acidophilus on klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and proteus mirabilis cells].
AB  == data of the ultrastructural cellular changes of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, including k. pneumoniae, c. freundii and p. mirabilis cells impacts to bacteriocin-producing l. acidophilus are presented. enterobacteria in  response to the bacteriocinogenic effect of lactobacilli are manifestated by expressive destructions of sensitive to pore formation bacteriocin cells. various morphological types of enterobacteria cells with increase of involution, lysing and resting forms are revealed. the specific ultrastructural changes of enterobacteria cells which evidencing the significant destructive processes of the cells membranes are detected. the destabilization of cellular wall in expansion periplasmic spaces and appearance of the ultrastructural reorganization of bacterial cells nucleoid also are registrated. revealing the mechanism of lactobacilli secreted bacteriocin action to conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria might provide new ways to select the effective highly antagonistic probiotic strains.
