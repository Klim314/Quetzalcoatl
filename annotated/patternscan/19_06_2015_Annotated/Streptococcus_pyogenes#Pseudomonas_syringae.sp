TI  == novel bacterial adp-ribosylating toxins: structure and function.
AB  == bacterial adp-ribosyltransferase toxins (bartts) transfer adp-ribose to eukaryotic proteins to promote bacterial pathogenesis. in this review, we use prototype bartts, such as diphtheria toxin and pertussis toxin, as references for the characterization of several new bartts from human, insect and plant pathogens, which were recently identified by bioinformatic analyses. several of these toxins, including cholix toxin (chxa) from vibrio cholerae, spya from streptococcus pyogenes, hopu1 from pseudomonas syringae and the tcc toxins from photorhabdus luminescens, adp-ribosylate novel substrates and have unique organizations, which distinguish them from the reference toxins. the characterization of these toxins increases our appreciation of the range of structural and functional properties that are possessed by bartts and their roles in bacterial pathogenesis.

TI  == robustness assessment of whole bacterial genome segmentations.
AB  == comparison of closely related bacterial genomes has revealed the presence of highly conserved sequences forming a "backbone" that is interrupted by numerous,  less conserved, dna fragments. segmentation of bacterial genomes into backbone and variable regions is particularly useful to investigate, among other things, bacterial genome evolution. several software tools have been designed to compare  complete bacterial chromosomes and a few online databases store pre-computed genome comparisons. however, very few statistical methods are available to evaluate the reliability of these software tools and to compare the results obtained with them. to fill this gap, we have developed two local scores to measure the robustness of bacterial genome segmentations. our method uses a simulation procedure based on random perturbations of the compared genomes. the two scores described in this article provide useful information and are easy to implement, and their interpretation is intuitive. we show that they are suited to discriminate between robust and non-robust segmentations when genome aligners such as mauve and mga are used.
