TI  == the heterologous expression of polysaccharidase-encoding genes with oenological relevance in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  == aims: the main objective of this study was to develop polysaccharide-degrading wine strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae, which are able to improve aspects of wine processing and clarification, as well as colour extraction and stabilization during winemaking. methods and results: two yeast expression/secretion gene cassettes were constructed, namely (i) a pectinase gene cassette (pppk) consisting of the endo-polygalacturonase gene (pele) from erwinia chrysanthemi and the pectate lyase gene (peh1) from erwinia carotovora and (ii) a glucanase/xylanase gene cassette (pexs) containing the endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene (end1) from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and the endo-beta-1,4-xylanase gene (xync) from aspergillus niger. the commercial wine yeast strain, vin13, was transformed separately with these two gene cassettes and checked for the production of pectinase, glucanase and xylanase activities. pinot noir, cinsaut and muscat d'alexandria grape juices were fermented using the vin13[pppk] pectinase- and the vin13[pexs] glucanase/xylanase-producing transformants. chemical analyses of the resultant wines indicated that (i) the pectinase-producing strain caused a decrease in the concentration of phenolic compounds in pinot noir whereas the glucanase/xylanase-producing strain caused an increase in phenolic compounds presumably because of the degradation of the grape skins; (ii) the glucanase/xylanase-producing strain caused a decrease in wine turbidity, especially in pinot noir wine, as well as a clear increase in colour intensity and (iii) in the muscat d'alexandria and cinsaut wines, the differences between the control wines (fermented with the untransformed vin3 strain) and the  wines produced by the two transformed strains were less prominent showing that the effect of these polysaccharide-degrading enzymes is cultivar-dependent. conclusions: the recombinant wine yeasts producing pectinase, glucanase and xylanase activities during the fermentation of pinot noir, cinsaut and muscat d'alexandria grape juice altered the chemical composition of the resultant wines  in a way that such yeasts could potentially be used to improve the clarity, colour intensity and stability and aroma of wine. significance and impact of the  study: aspects of commercial-scale wine processing and clarification, colour extraction and stabilization, and aroma enhancement could potentially be improved by the use of polysaccharide-degrading wine yeasts without the addition of expensive commercial enzyme preparations. this offers the potential to further improve the price:quality ratio of wine according to consumer expectations.

TI  == the effect of polysaccharide-degrading wine yeast transformants on the efficiency of wine processing and wine flavour.
AB  == commercial polysaccharase preparations are applied to winemaking to improve wine  processing and quality. expression of polysaccharase-encoding genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae allows for the recombinant strains to degrade polysaccharides that traditional commercial yeast strains cannot. in this study,  we constructed recombinant wine yeast strains that were able to degrade the problem-causing grape polysaccharides, glucan and xylan, by separately integrating the trichoderma reesei xyn2 xylanase gene construct and the butyrivibrio fibrisolvens end1 glucanase gene cassette into the genome of the commercial wine yeast strain s. cerevisiae vin13. these genes were also combined  in s. cerevisiae vin13 under the control of different promoters. the strains that were constructed were compared under winemaking conditions with each other and with a recombinant wine yeast strain expressing the endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene  cassette (end1) from b. fibrisolvens and the endo-beta-1,4-xylanase gene cassette (xyn4) from aspergillus niger, a recombinant strain expressing the pectate lyase  gene cassette (pel5) from erwinia chrysanthemi and the polygalacturonase-encoding gene cassette (peh1) from erwinia carotovora. wine was made with the recombinant  strains using different grape cultivars. fermentations with the recombinant vin13 strains resulted in significant increases in free-flow wine when ruby cabernet must was fermented. after 6 months of bottle ageing significant differences in colour intensity and colour stability could be detected in pinot noir and ruby cabernet wines fermented with different recombinant strains. after this period the volatile composition of muscat d'alexandria, ruby cabernet and pinot noir wines fermented with different recombinant strains also showed significant differences. the pinot noir wines were also sensorial evaluated and the tasting panel preferred the wines fermented with the recombinant strains.
