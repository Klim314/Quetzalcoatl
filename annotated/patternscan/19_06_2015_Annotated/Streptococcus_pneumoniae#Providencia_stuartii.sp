TI  == gemifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == gemifloxacin is a dual targeted fluoroquinolone with potent in vitro activity against gram-positive, -negative and atypical human pathogens--pathogens considered to be important causes of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. gemifloxacin demonstrates impressive minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic 90 ) values against clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae and legionella spp., with mic 90 values reported to be 0.016-0.06, < 0.0008-0.06, 0.008-0.3, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.016-0.07 microg/ml, respectively. gemifloxacin is also active in vitro against a broad range of gram-negative bacilli with mic 90 values against the enterobacteriaceae in the range of 0.016 to > 16 microg/ml ( escherichia coli and providencia stuartii, respectively), with the majority of the genus having mic 90 drug concentrations < 0.5 microg/ml. the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against anaerobic organisms is variable. the mic values  for gemifloxacin are not affected by beta-lactamase production nor by penicillin  or macrolide resistance in s. pneumoniae. gemifloxacin is approved by the fda to  be clinically efficacious against multi-drug resistant s. pneumoniae. the pharmacokinetics of gemifloxacin are such that the drug can be administered orally once-daily to yield or achieve sustainable drug concentrations exceeding the mic values of clinically important organisms. gemifloxacin has been shown to  target both dna gyrase (preferred target) and topoisomerase iv (secondary target) - enzymes critical for dna replication and organism survival - against clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. this dual targeting activity is thought to be important for reducing the likelihood for selecting for quinolone resistance. gemifloxacin has been investigated and approved for therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. in one study, more patients receiving gemifloxacin compared to clarithromycin remained free of exacerbations for longer periods of time (p < 0.016) and gemifloxacin had a shorter time to eradication of h. influenzae than did clarithromycin (p < 0.02). from efficacy studies, gemifloxacin was found to have  an adverse profile that was comparable with other compounds. the most frequent side effects were diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. gemifloxacin is a welcomed addition to currently available agents for the treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. other potential indications appear to be within the spectrum of this compound.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == isolation and identification of bacteria associated with adult laboratory mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae).
AB  == from the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, vibrionaceae, micrococcaceae, deinococcacea, bacillaceae, and the genus listeria. enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with citrobacter, streptococcus, aerococcus, and listeria found less frequently. we found bacillus cereus, enterobacter sakazakii, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. we also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, e. sakazakii, k. pneumoniae spp., providencia rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus. isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of gv129606, a new broad-spectrum trinem.
AB  == gv129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. it combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for gv129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes,  including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, gv129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. gv129606 showed an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, gv129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed mic90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family enterobacteriaceae with mic90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. against these species, gv129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with mic90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii).  haemophilus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of gv129606. gv129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. it was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). the in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ed50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. gv129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ed50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics from u.s. clinical trials over a 5-year period.
AB  == results are reported for agar dilution susceptibility testing of 3,075 isolates of aerobic bacteria collected from >200 u.s. institutions, located in 30 different states. these isolates were collected from 1987 through 1991 from patients who participated in cefepime clinical trials. cefepime susceptibility was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and imipenem. to avoid duplication of strains, only initial isolates were included. cefepime minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values for enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.5 microg/ml, except for two species, citrobacter freundii and providencia stuartii, with mic90 values of 2 and 1, respectively. the mic90 values of the other cephalosporins were higher, especially for enterobacter aerogenes and c. freundii. the mic90 values of cefepime for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 microg/ml) were similar to those of cefotaxime for s. aureus (4 microg/ml), and to ceftazidime for p. aeruginosa (8 microg/ml). streptococcus pneumoniae was similar in susceptibility to cefotaxime at 0.06 microg/ml. the activity of cefepime against a diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative (1987-1991) bacteria isolates demonstrates the excellent activity of cefepime compared to third-generation cephalosporins and imipenem, particularly among c. freundii and e. aerogenes isolates, which were often resistant to other cephalosporins.

TI  == in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone cp-99,219.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone cp-99,219 [7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl)naphthyridone] was compared with those of four other quinolones against 541 gram-negative, 283 gram-positive, and 70 anaerobic bacterial isolates. cp-99,219 inhibited 90% of many isolates in the family enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml (range, < 0.008 to 1 microgram/ml), an activity comparable to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin and two times greater than that of temafloxacin. ninety percent of the proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 micrograms of cp-99,219 per ml. cp-99,219 inhibited 90% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae  isolates at 1 and 0.015 micrograms/ml, respectively. the compound inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus at 0.06 micrograms/ml, whereas a ciprofloxacin concentration of 1 microgram/ml was required to inhibit these organisms. cp-99,219 inhibited 90% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates at a concentration of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, while ciprofloxacin and temafloxacin had mics against these isolates of > 16 micrograms/ml. streptococci were inhibited by < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml, an activity comparable to that of tosufloxacin. cp-99,219 was eight times more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae. bacteroides species were inhibited by cp-99,219 at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml, whereas inhibition of these species required 4- and 16-microgram/ml concentrations of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. the mbcs of cp-99,219 ranged from two to four times the mics, and inoculum size had a minimal effect on mic. cp-99,219 was active against p. aeruginosa at ph 5.5, with only a fourfold increase in mic compared with values obtained at ph 7.5. the addition of up to 9 mm mg(2+) increased the mic range from 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml to 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml. in view of its excellent in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, cp-99,219 merits further study to determine it's clinical pharmacologic properties and potential for therapeutic use.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ru29246, the active metabolite of hr916b.
AB  == hr 916b is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. in tests its active metabolite, ru29246, inhibited streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. it was also more active (mic 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. ru29246 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor,  but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. it did not inhibit pseudomonas  aeruginosa and other pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens or  bacteroides fragilis. ru29246 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, staphylococcus aureus  tem-2 or moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of proteus vulgaris and morganella morganii. plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by ru29246.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of bmy-28232, parent compound of an oral cephalosporin.
AB  == bmy-28232, an aminothiazolyl imino methoxy cephalosporin which is available as an orally absorbed acetoxyethyl ester, inhibited strains of methicillin-susceptible  staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and many strains of proteus and providencia stuartii at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, including isolates resistant to cephalexin and cefaclor. it had activity similar to that of cefixime, but was  more active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. bmy-28232 was a poor substrate for beta-lactamases but was destroyed by the new tem-3 enzyme, and had  less activity against enterobacter species, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris isolates. methicillin-resistant staphylococci, pseudomonas species, enterococci, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jeikeium, bacteroides fragilus and some strains of clostridium species were resistant to bmy-28232.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == clinical correlates of bacteremia in a veterans administration extended care facility.
AB  == little is known about bacteremia in long-term care facilities. we have conducted  a retrospective study during a 12-month period analyzing the clinical correlates  of bacteremia in 533 chronically institutionalized, predominantly male patients,  with an average age of 69 years. thirty-four men had forty-two bacteremic illnesses during this period. the incidence rate was 0.30 episodes per 1000 patient care days, and the mortality rate was 21%. the urinary tract was the most frequently identified tissue source (56%), followed by respiratory tract (7%) and skin (7%). providencia stuartii was the most common gram-negative organism, while staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus were the frequent gram-positive microbes. gram-negative bacteremia accounted for 63% of the episodes (15% mortality rate), and gram-positive bacteremia accounted for 27% (18% mortality rate); 10% of the bacteremias were polymicrobial (25% mortality rate). most of the isolated organisms were sensitive to available antimicrobial agents. the leading risk factor for bacteremia was an indwelling urinary catheter (odds ratio 39, 95% confidence limits 16 to 97). patients with urinary catheters  at the beginning of the study constituted only 5% of the population, but accounted for 40% of the gram-negative bacteremias during the year of observation.

TI  == the resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  == isolates of providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. all species survived the antiseptic. organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. the effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. we conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate  established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fr 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fr 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. it was less active (mic, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit  streptococcus faecalis or listeria monocytogenes. fr 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. fr 17027 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, providencia stuartii, providencia rettgeri, and citrobacter diversus at  less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. some strains of enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (mic, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). fr 17027 did not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa, other pseudomonas species, acinetobacter species, or bacteroides species. activity was  minimally affected by growth conditions. fr 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.

TI  == in vitro activity of fludalanine combined with pentizidone compared with those of other agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fludalanine ( mk641 ) combined with pentizidone ( mk642  ) so as to give a fludalanine /d-cycloserine ratio of 1:1 was compared with the activities of ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim  against 452 recent isolates and known beta-lactam- and trimethoprim-resistant strains. in addition, the in vitro activity of fludalanine - pentizidone on four  different media, including a defined medium ( dfn -2), was studied. the mic of fludalanine - pentizidone against 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., providencia stuartii, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, staphylococcus aureus, and fecal streptococci was 4 micrograms or less per ml on dfn -2, and activity was somewhat reduced on the other media. proteus spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa (90% mic, less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml) and bacteroides spp. (90% mic, 16 micrograms/ml) were less susceptible. generally, fludalanine - pentizidone was less active than ceftazidime and comparable in activity to cefuroxime. beta-lactamase-producing and trimethoprim-resistant strains tended to be susceptible to fludalanine - pentidizone . in the absence of human serum, the mbc of fludalanine - pentizidone was similar to the mic. in the presence of increasing concentrations of human serum, there tended to be a greater difference between the mic and mbc.

TI  == in-vitro activity of enoxacin (cl-919), a new quinoline derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of enoxacin (ci-919), a new synthetic quinoline derivative  was compared with that of three other quinolines ofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. in addition beta-lactams and gentamicin were also included when appropriate. the mics of enoxacin for 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., proteus spp., providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus were less than 4 mg/l, for haemophilus influenzae less than 0.25 mg/l and neisseria gonorrhoeae less than 0.03 mg/l. bacteroides fragilis and streptococci (including streptococcus pneumoniae) were less susceptible, mic90 16 mg/l. against many of the common enterobacteriaceae enoxacin displayed a similar  degree of activity as gentamicin. gentamicin-resistant strains of common bacterial pathogens were susceptible to enoxacin as were methicillin-resistant staph. aureus. the protein binding of enoxacin (concentration 5 mg/l) was 18%.

TI  == comparative activities of the oxa-beta-lactam ly127935, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, and ticarcillin against multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == a total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. these strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, ly127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (hr 756), and cefoperazone (t 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the  same hospital in 1979. susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two  nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins  and other effective antibiotics. the agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. the multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. both klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935 and cefotaxime. p. aeruginosa  (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. all three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935. the three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to  ly127935. none of the three new beta-lactams was active against s. faecalis. all  were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae.

TI  == susceptibility of recently isolated bacteria to amikacin in vitro: comparisons with four other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  == in vitro tests for susceptibility to amikacin and to four other aminoglycoside antibiotics were carried out with strains of many bacterial species by use of an  agar dilution method and an inocula replicator. in general, amikacin was as active as or more active against most of the organims than kanamycin, neomycin, and streptomycin; in particular, amikacin was active against strains resistant to one or more of these three antibiotics. amikacin was more active than gentamicin  against strains of nocardia asteroides and providencia stuartii and also against  gentamicin-resistant strains of some other gram-negative bacilli, notably serratia marcescens. however, gentamicin was more active than amikacin against most of the other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that were tested. in comparative tests of four media, minimal inhibitory concentrations mics) were greater in tests with mueller-hinton agar, and generally somewhat lower in those  with heart infusion agar, than in tests with trypticase soy agar and nutrient agar. inocula of a 1:1,000 dilution of culture generally gave mics lower than those obtained with undiluted cultures; the differences were small with enterococci, but they were greater with amikacin than with gentamicin in tests on strains of klebsiella pneumoniae. these findings generally confirm those previously reported by others.
