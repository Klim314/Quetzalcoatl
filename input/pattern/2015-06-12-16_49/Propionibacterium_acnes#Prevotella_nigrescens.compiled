TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota in adult Down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The subgingival microbiota in Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 Down syndrome, 66 non-Down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. This involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome subject groups were quantified using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than non-Down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). Most microbial species were present in Down syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-Down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of Selenomonas noxia, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of Treponema socranskii in Down syndrome subjects compared with non-Down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of Streptococcus constellatus in Down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. Down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of T. socranskii than Down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). Higher subgingival proportions of S. constellatus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, S. noxia and Prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42) and higher proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii II and Actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in Down syndrome adults. CONCLUSION: Individuals with Down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. These findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in Down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in Down syndrome.
TI  - Effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
AB  - With the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use Er:YAG lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. We examined their effects against biofilms made of Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Propionibacterium acnes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Prevotella nigrescens in vitro. After Er:YAG laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 J/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. The Er:YAG laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by L. casei. After irradiation, the numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. Er: YAG lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.
TI  - Relationship between periodontal pocket sulfide levels and subgingival species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many species implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). This investigation examined the relationship between levels of sulfide and subgingival bacterial species in the same periodontal pockets. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty chronic periodontitis subjects were measured clinically at six sites per tooth for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. Subgingival plaque samples, taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth, were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Sulfide levels were measured at the same sites using a Diamond Probe/Perio 2000 system. Clinical and microbiological data were averaged for sulfide-positive and -negative sites separately in each subject and then averaged across subjects. Significance differences in clinical and microbial parameters between sulfide-positive and -negative sites were sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts (x10(5), +/-SEM) at sulfide-negative and -positive sites were 44.0 +/- 9.9 and 65.0 +/- 13.3, respectively (p < 0.01). Seventeen species were found at significantly higher levels in sulfide-positive than -negative sites. These included abundant producers of VSC such as members of the genera Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Prevotella, Treponema and Eubacterium, and Bacteriodes forsythus, Selenomonas noxia and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella intermedia, Bacteriodes forsythus, Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and Treponema denticola exhibited the greatest difference in mean counts between sulfide-negative and -positive sites. Orange and red complex species were at higher counts at shallow (< 4 mm) sulfide-positive than shallow sulfide-negative sites. Although not statistically significant, mean clinical parameters were somewhat higher at sulfide-positive than sulfide-negative sites. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-pocket sulfide levels reflect the levels of sulfide-producing species and may provide useful diagnostic information.
TI  - Ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  - DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. Eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. Purified DNA was digested with BglI,EcoRI, and HindIII. Hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe obtained by reverse transcription of Escherichia coli 16S + 23S rRNA. Ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. The results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (S(AB)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the Dendron computer-assisted system. These results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. Phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. The present experiment using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. Soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the root canal and blood. These included Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia. Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis. The electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. Furthermore, with this typing method the species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated. These species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. Also, differences between subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with SDS-PAGE, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. The electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola.
AB  - Bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. In the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. The activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. Proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin III, antiplasmin and cystatin C) was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The 80 kDa trypsin-like protease of P. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kDa chymotrypsin-like protease of T. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin C. When whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with P. gingivalis, T. denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Capnocytophaga spp. Peptostreptococcus micros and Propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus and Fusobacterium nucleatum, had no effect on the protease inhibitors. The 80 kDa protease of P. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kDa protease of T. denticola. This study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. This may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.
