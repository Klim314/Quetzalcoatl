TI  == etiology of diarrhea in pediatric outpatient settings.
AB  == background: the frequency with which bacteria cause diarrhea evaluated in ambulatory settings is often unknown. we attempted to determine the microbiologic etiology of diarrhea in a private pediatric practice (site a) and a clinic serving largely immigrant children (site b) and to establish guidelines for bacterial culture. methods: children with diarrhea were prospectively enrolled, and their stools were examined for diarrheagenic bacteria, viruses and parasites. results: a total of 123 and 103 children were enrolled at sites a and b, respectively. stools from all (100%), 126 (55.8%), 104 (46.0%) and 75 (33.2%) were tested for bacterial enteric pathogens, parasites, clostridium difficile toxin and viruses, respectively. of the 75 patients whose stool underwent complete testing, 36 (48%) contained at least 1 definitive or plausible pathogen. twelve stools (5.3%) tested positive for bacteria [campylobacter jejuni (n = 7),  yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, shigella sonnei, salmonella serogroup d and salmonella braenderup (n = 1 each)]. one contained blastocystis hominis, 8  contained c. difficile toxin and 16 contained viruses (9 rotavirus, 5 adenovirus  and 2 astrovirus). visible fecal blood (p = 0.029), increased stool frequency (p  = 0.035), abdominal tenderness (p = 0.011) and fecal white (p < 0.001) or red blood cells (p = 0.002) were associated with bacterial infection. all children with stool yielding diarrheagenic bacteria or c. difficile toxin had at least 1 of these factors, but so did 75% of children without these agents (positive predictive value, 11%; negative predictive value, 100%; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 25%). conclusions: the bacterial diarrhea prevalence is similar to that in other ambulatory studies, although the spectrum differs. exclusion criteria for stool testing in diarrhea remain elusive. studies to determine the etiology of unexplained diarrhea and cost-effective algorithms for diarrhea diagnosis, are needed.

TI  == enteropathogens associated with cases of gastroenteritis in a rural population in jordan.
AB  == stool specimens were collected from 180 patients belonging to a population of recently settled bedouins in jordan who presented with acute or persistent diarrhoea and other symptoms, and from 100 non-diarrhoeal controls. all samples were examined for parasites and bacterial pathogens by culture and pcr. bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to common antimicrobial agents. pathogens and potential enteropathogens were identified from 140 (77.8%) of the patients, with more than one pathogen being recovered from 67 (37.2%) patients. potentially pathogenic parasites were observed in 90 (50%) patients; those that were associated significantly with diarrhoea were giardia lamblia, blastocystis hominis, cryptosporidium spp., entamoeba histolytica and cyclospora cayetanensis. pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 72 (40%) patients, and, of these, 62.5% were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and 30.6% of these were multiresistant. diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli strains were found in 14.3% of the patients and 2.9% of the control subjects (not statistically significant). the most common enteropathogenic bacteria found were shigella spp., campylobacter jejuni and yersinia enterocolitica. unusual bacterial species were the predominant organisms recovered in a few cases and could represent a possible cause of diarrhoea. overall, there was a high endemicity of diarrhoeal disease in the area studied. risk factors that correlated significantly with contracting diarrhoea were socio-economic status, education, use of unchlorinated well or tank water, and a low level of personal hygiene.
