TI  == standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, pvp-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  == background: this study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics pvp-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and  polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. methods: mics and mbcs were determined in accordance with din 58940-7 and 58940-8 using staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus), streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, haemophilus influenzae and candida albicans. the microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with din en 1040 and 1275 using s. aureus,  p. aeruginosa and c. albicans. results: for chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, mic(48) and mbc(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/l. maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/l, with an efficacy gap against p. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of pvp-iodine were 1024 mg/l, with a gap against s. pneumoniae. comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. after 1 min, only octenidine and pvp-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. conclusions: tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. when a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine >  chlorhexidine > triclosan > pvp-iodine. this is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. if an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = pvp-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.

TI  == bsac standardized disc susceptibility testing method (version 8).
AB  == there have been considerable changes to the format of the recommendations since the previous version (version 7). the majority of the footnotes to the tables have been removed and the notations added to the end column; it is hoped that this change will avoid confusion in interpretation. antibiotics have been separated into groups, e.g. beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, etc. recommendations for urinary tract infections (utis) have been removed for most agents except for  those that are administered solely for the treatment of uncomplicated utis or where there are limited recommendations for specific organisms, e.g. trimethoprim. for agents that previously had dual recommendations, systemic recommendations remain and the intermediate category can be used for interpretation for utis because intermediate susceptibility infers that the infection may respond as the agent is concentrated at the site of infection. this change will also avoid errors in interpretation when an organism is isolated from multiple sites, e.g. blood and urine. the changes that have been made to version  7 are as follows: mic and zone diameter breakpoints (bps) for trimethoprim, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin for utis (table 7); mic and zone diameter breakpoints (bps) for doripenem (tables 7-9); colistin mic bps for pseudomonas spp. (table 9), co-trimoxazole mic bps for stenotrophomonas maltophilia (table 10); staphylococci mic and zone diameter bps for clarithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, trimethoprim uti, nitrofurantoin uti and rifampicin (table 11); streptococcus pneumoniae mic and zone diameter bps for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, linezolid, rifampicin and telithromycin (table 12); addition of streptomycin recommendations for enterococci (table 13); enterococcal mic and zone diameter bps for quinupristin/dalfopristin, nitrofurantoin uti and trimethoprim uti (table 13); beta-haemolytic streptococci mic and zone diameter bps for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and telithromycin (table 15); clarithromycin and erythromycin mic and zone diameter bps for moraxella catarrhalis (table 16); azithromycin mic bps for neisseria gonorrhoeae (table 17); chloramphenicol and rifampicin mic bps for neisseria meningitidis (table 18); azithromycin mic bps for haemophilus influenzae (table 19); mic bps for metronidazole for bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and clostridium perfringens (tables 23-25, respectively); susceptibility testing of listeria spp. (appendix 3); the acceptable range for atcc 25923 to a 10 microg tobramycin disc (table 26).

TI  == comparative evaluation of bact/alert 3d and bactec systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  == objective: to compare bact/alert (bta) and bactec 9240 (bac), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. materials and methods:  blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented bta and bac standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. the time to growth detection (td) was recorded for each bottle that became positive.  a quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess td of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. results: a total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both bta and bac bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by bta bottles and 13 (56.5%) by bac. proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the bta system. the average tds were 19.0 and 24.6 h for bta and bac, respectively. analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same  for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa but slightly different for haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. the anaerobic  bottle ofthe bta did not support the growth of h. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) cfu/ml whereas the bac did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml. td for  s. pneumoniae in the bta was about half of that in the bac. conclusions: the bta  system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the bac system to detect the same organism.

TI  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae-binding gangliosides of human respiratory (hep-2) cells have a requisite lacto/neolacto core structure.
AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) are a major cause of human infections.  we previously demonstrated high affinity and high specificity binding of nthi to  minor gangliosides of human respiratory (hep-2) cells and macrophages, but not to brain gangliosides. we further identified the nthi-binding ganglioside of human macrophages as alpha2,3-sialylosylparagloboside (iv3neuac-nlcose4cer, nlm1), which possesses a neolacto core structure that is absent in brain gangliosides. this supported a hypothesis that lacto/neolacto core carbohydrates are critical for nthi-ganglioside binding. to investigate, we determined the core carbohydrate structure of nthi-binding gangliosides of hep-2 cells, through multiple approaches, including specific enzymatic degradation, mass spectral analysis and  gas-liquid chromatography. our analyses denote the following critical structural  attributes of nthi-binding gangliosides: (1) a conserved lacto/neolacto core structure; (2) requisite sialylation, which may be either internal or external, with alpha2,3 (human macrophages) or alpha2,6 (hep-2 cells) anomeric linkages; (3) internalized galactose residues. mass spectral and gas chromatographic analyses confirm that nthi-binding gangliosides of hep-2 cells possess lacto/neolacto carbohydrate cores and identify the structure of the major peak as neuacalpha2-6galbeta1-4glcnacbeta1-3galbeta1-4glcbeta1-1cer (alpha2,6-sialosylparagloboside, nlm1). collectively, our studies denote nthi-binding gangliosides as lacto/neolacto series structures.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == infections in patients with immunodeficiency with thymoma (good syndrome). report of 5 cases and review of the literature.
AB  == immunodeficiency with thymoma (good syndrome, gs) is a rare, adult-onset condition that is characterized by thymoma, hypogammaglobulinemia, and low numbers of peripheral b cells. cd4+ t lymphopenia and an inverted cd4:cd8+ t-cell ratio may be present. here we report 5 patients with gs and infectious complications who were seen at 3 institutions between 1983 and 1999. three patients had recurrent sinopulmonary infections, 3 had severe cytomegalovirus (cmv) disease, and 1 had pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. review of the literature identified 46 other reports of infections in gs patients. the infections reported in all 51 patients included recurrent sinopulmonary infection (19 cases with documented respiratory pathogens), generally with encapsulated bacteria, most often haemophilus influenzae (11 cases); cmv disease (5 cases); bacteremia (7 cases); oral or esophageal candidiasis (6 cases); persistent mucocutaneous candidiasis (5 cases); chronic diarrhea (5 cases with documented stool pathogens); urinary tract infections (4 cases); p. carinii pneumonia (3 cases); tuberculosis (2 cases); kaposi sarcoma (1 case); disseminated varicella (1 case); candidemia (1 case); wound infection with clostridium perfringens (1 case); mycoplasma arthritis (1 case); and other infections. patients with gs present with a spectrum of sinopulmonary infections and pathogens similar to common variable immunodeficiency (cvid). compared with patients with cvid, opportunistic infections, including severe cmv disease, p. carinii pneumonia, and mucocutaneous candidiasis, appear to be more common in patients with gs, and patients with gs may have a worse prognosis. gs should be ruled out in patients with thymoma or cvid who develop severe, especially opportunistic, infections. treatment with intravenous immune globulin is recommended for all patients with gs.

TI  == the terminal enzymes of sialic acid metabolism: acylneuraminate pyruvate-lyases.
AB  == the acylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase gene from clostridium perfringens was sequenced and found to be most similar to the lyase gene from haemophilus influenzae. both the recombinant clostridial enzyme and the native enzyme from pig kidney were purified in larger amounts and characterized. the properties of the porcine lyase are similar to the microbial ones. however, the much higher degree of similarity in comparison to the microbial enzymes that was found between porcine lyase peptides and two putative mammalian lyase sequences show that the latter form an own group apart from the microbial lyases. actual models  of the acylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase reaction are discussed.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. mics of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. the activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (mic50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/l) than previously reported for ofloxacin. as seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and  pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (mic 1-8 mg/l). mics for pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/l. levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; mic 0.06-0.25 mg/l), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; mic 1-32 mg/l). haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (mics 0.016-0.03 mg/l, 0.03-0.12 mg/l) and 0.03-0.12 mg/l, respectively). clostridium perfringens (n = 23; mic 0.25-1 mg/l) was more susceptible than bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; mic 0.5-4 mg/l). levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci (n = 107; mic 0.03-0.5 mg/l); the resistant strains (mics 2-32 mg/l) were usually also resistant to methicillin. levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; mic 1-32 mg/l), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (mics 0.5-2 mg/l). according to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for mics of 1, 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. in conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin  compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and expression of the acylneuraminate lyase gene from clostridium perfringens a99.
AB  == the acylneuraminate lyase gene from clostridium perfringens a99 was cloned on a 3.3 kb hindiii dna fragment identified by screening the chromosomal dna of this species by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe that had been deduced from the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein, and another probe directed against a region that is conserved in the acylneuraminate lyase gene of  escherichia coli and in the putative gene of clostridium tertium. after cloning,  three of the recombinant clones expressed lyase activity above the background of  the endogenous enzyme of the e. coli host. the sequenced part of the cloned fragment contains the complete acylneuraminate lyase gene (orf2) of 864 bp that encodes 288 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 32.3 kda. the lyase structural gene follows a noncoding region with an inverted repeat and a ribosome binding site. upstream from this regulatory region another open reading frame (orf1) was detected. the 3'-terminus of the lyase structural gene is followed by  a further orf (orf3). a high homology was found between the amino acid sequences  of the sialate lyases from clostridium perfringens and haemophilus influenzae (75% identical amino acids) or trichomonas vaginalis (69% identical amino acids), respectively, whereas the similarity to the gene from e. coli is low (38% identical amino acids). based on our new sequence data, the 'large' sialidase gene and the lyase gene of c. perfringens are not arranged next to each other on  the chromosome of this species.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. this compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite r-95867. the antibacterial activity of r-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. r-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of  activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the  bacterial species tested. r-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, clostridium perfringens, neisseria spp., moraxella  catarrhalis, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae (mic at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). r-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteroides fragilis. r-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and escherichia coli. penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of s. aureus and 1bs, 2, 3, and 4 of e. coli had high affinities for r-95867. the in vivo efficacy of cs-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. the efficacy of cs-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, e. coli, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris. among the drugs tested, cs-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == the helicobacter pylori urec gene codes for a phosphoglucosamine mutase.
AB  == the function of urec, the product of a 1,335-bp-long open reading frame upstream  from the urease structural genes (ureab) of helicobacter pylori, was investigated. we present data showing that the urec gene product is a phosphoglucosamine mutase. d. mengin-lecreulx and j. van heijenoort (j. biol. chem. 271:32-39, 1996) observed that urec is similar (43% identity) to the glmm protein of escherichia coli. those authors showed that glmm is a phosphoglucosamine mutase catalyzing interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is subsequently transformed into udp-n-acetylglucosamine. the latter product is one of the main cytoplasmic precursors of cell wall peptidoglycan and outer membrane lipopolysaccharides. the present paper reports that, like its e. coli homolog glmm, the h. pylori urec gene is essential for cell growth. it was known that growth of a lethal conditional glmm mutant of e. coli at a nonpermissive temperature can be restored in the presence of the urec gene. we showed that complete complementation of the  glmm mutant can be obtained with a plasmid overproducing urec. the peptidoglycan  content and the specific phosphoglucosamine mutase activity of such a complemented strain were measured; these results demonstrated that the urec gene  product functions as a phosphoglucosamine mutase. homologs of the urec and glmm proteins were identified in haemophilus influenzae, mycobacterium leprae, clostridium perfringens, synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, and methanococcus jannaschii. significant conservation of the amino acid sequence of these proteins in such diverse organisms suggests a very ancient common ancestor for the genes and defines a consensus motif for the phosphoglucosamine mutase active site. we propose renaming the h. pylori urec gene the glmm gene.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mics <  or = 4 mg/l), with reduced activity against serratia spp. (mic90 = 32 mg/l). in common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic > 128 mg/l). faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for mrsa mics were raised (mic90 = 2 mg/l) compared with those for mssa (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l). faropenem was also found to be  active against streptococci, neisseria spp., enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis. of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and clostridium perfringens (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l). an increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem mics for morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l and for mrsa from 0.25-2 mg/l to 8 mg/l (a similar increase was not observed for mssa). the mics of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. mics for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. in hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases,  including tem-1, shv-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, tem-3 and tem-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus (nctc 11561).

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

TI  == new drugs--reports of new drugs recently approved by the fda. dirithromycin.
AB  == dirithromycin is a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin, a 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotic. the drug is converted during absorption and distribution, to an active metabolite 9-(s)-erythromycylamine, which is the predominant compound found in plasma and extravascular tissues. high tissue concentration of  erythromycylamine is achieved after oral doses of dirithromycin, with slow release back into the circulation. the mechanism of action of dirithromycin is like that of erythromycin and other macrolides. these compounds inhibit rna-dependent protein synthesis. it has recently been suggested that all macrolides stimulate dissociation of peptidyl-trna from ribosomes during the elongation phase, leading to inhibited protein synthesis. the antimicrobial spectrum of dirithromycin is similar to that of erythromycin, although the drug offers no significant advantage with regard to mic values. in vitro against gram-positive isolates, dirithromycin exhibits similar potency to that of clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, and clindamycin. in vivo, dirithromycin is active against penicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae. dirithromycin is as effective as penicillin vk against streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsilitis, and  as effective as erythromycin against acute superimposed chronic bronchitis and skin and soft-tissue infections. in comparison with other newer macrolides, dirithromycin has shown similar or lesser in vitro activity. in particular, haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides spp., peptococcus-peptostreprococcus spp., clostridium perfringens, legionella spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, and chlamydia trachomatis were all less sensitive to dirithromycin than azithromycin or clarithromycin. once-daily oral administration of dirithromycin (500 mg) has been demonstrated to be similar in efficacy to erythromycin (250 mg, 4 times daily), each for approximately 7 days, in the treatment of acute bronchitis or acute-exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in controlled studies. proven or presumed pathogen eradication rates were 83 and 86% for acute bronchitis patients treated with dirithromycin and erythromycin, respectively. corresponding bacteriological response rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were  75 to 84% with dirithromycin and 75 to 82% with erythromycin. both agents achieved clinical cure or improvement in over 85% of the patients with either condition. the main advantage of dirithromycin over erythromycin appears to be once-daily administration. lilly launched dirithromycin in september 1993, in spain, received approval from fda in august 1995, and launched it during october  1995.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  == rp 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of rp 57669 and rp 54476. the activity of rp 59500 and its two components against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. rp 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal  to 1 mg/l (range 0.06-2 mg/l). both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of s. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and  ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group c and g streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/l. the mic90 was 4 mg/l for haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/l for moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59500 did not inhibit enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of rp 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were bacteroides spp. rp 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. mbcs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and s. aureus, compared with mbcs in broth, but rp 59500  was as active at ph 6 as at ph 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. rp 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bay y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  == bay y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as bacteriodes fragilis and clostridium perfringens. mic90s for s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and s. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant s. aureus, mic50 levels of bay y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. the potency of bay y3118 against all members of the enterobacteriaceae generally  was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. bay y3118 was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on mic determinations. the drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference mbcs and time-kill curves. from the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. the spanish group for the study of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. according to the criteria of mccabe and jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. the clinical condition  of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or  good in 28. sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. the causative micro-organisms were: escherichia coli (18 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

TI  == the comparative in-vitro activity of ofloxacin.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared with that of nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, enoxacin, pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). ofloxacin was very active against nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates of the enterobacteriaceae (mic less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) and was also active against strains resistant to nalidixic acid (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l). the activity was similar to norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin but some four-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin. all of the fluoroquinolones were highly active against vibrio cholerae (mic less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), v. parahaemolyticus (mic less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) aeromonas hydrophila (mic less than or equal to 0.03  mg/l), plesiomonas shigelloides (mic less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), campylobacter jejuni (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l), neisseria spp., haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi, bordetella pertussis and legionella pneumophila (mic less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l for all species). ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin (mic less than or equal to 1, 2 and 2 mg/l, respectively) showed similar activity against staphylococcus spp. and were somewhat more active than enoxacin (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l) and norfloxacin (mic less than or equal to 8 mg/l). ofloxacin was moderately active against beta-haemolytic streptococcus spp. (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l), corynebacterium diphtheriae (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and cory. jeikeium (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l) and somewhat less active against alpha- and non-haemolytic streptococcus spp., str. pneumoniae and listeria monocytogenes (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l for all species) and str. faecalis (mic less than or equal to 8 mg/l). the activity of ofloxacin, against these species, was similar to ciprofloxacin and four to eight times greater than norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin. ofloxacin, and all of the fluoroquinolones, were less active against anaerobic than aerobic bacteria. clostridium perfringens (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) was more susceptible to ofloxacin than were other anaerobic species and cl. difficile (mic less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was more  resistant. ofloxacin was the most active compound tested against chlamydia trachomatis sa2f (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l) with only ciprofloxacin (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) approaching similar activity.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == comparative activity of the 4-quinolones.
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the 4-quinolones ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, difloxacin, a-56620, and ci-934 are consistent world-wide, with allowances for differences in acquired resistance. mics of these drugs for enterobacteriaceae correlate with those of nalidixic acid, but resistance to the quinolones is rare if a breakpoint of greater than 2  mg/l is accepted. most intestinal pathogens are sensitive. acinetobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other pseudomonas species except pseudomonas maltophilia are usually sensitive. ciprofloxacin is generally the most active of  the 4-quinolones against these organisms. all of the new agents have antistaphylococcal activity, but that of norfloxacin and ofloxacin is borderline. against streptococci, including enterococci and pneumococci, the drugs' activity  is moderate or poor. haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis are very  sensitive. gonococci and meningococci are also highly sensitive to the new agents, but activity against chlamydia trachomatis and the mycoplasmas is borderline. the organisms associated with nonspecific vaginal infection are not very sensitive. anaerobes except bacteroides ureolyticus and clostridium perfringens are mostly resistant.

AB  == forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. there were five types of infections. infections commonly associated with a t-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with salmonella species, listeria monocytogenes, cryptococcus neoformans, and histoplasma capsulatum. infections commonly associated with a b-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis. other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, staphylococcus aureus, and mixed s. aureus and group g streptococcus. other infections occurring out of  the hospital included those with s. aureus, clostridium perfringens, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group b streptococcus. because two thirds of  the septicemias were caused by organisms other than t-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.
