TI  == conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  == background: in captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the  eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. results: samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. all samples showed bacterial growth. thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. most frequently isolated bacterial species were bacillus spp. (13 isolates), staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), staphylococcus sciuri and aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). only one isolate of kocuria varians/rosea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida,  pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, proteus spp., pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. the presence in 8 animals of mycoplasma spp. and  in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of chlamydia spp. was detected by pcr. candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. conclusions: a clear predominance of gram positive isolates in tortoises and gram negative isolates in turtles was found. however, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. that chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard  to salmonella spp. therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. worthy of note is the finding of chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.

TI  == emerging issues in antimicrobial resistance of bacteria from food-producing animals.
AB  == during the last decade, antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food-producing  animals has become a major research topic. in this review, different emerging resistance properties related to bacteria of food-producing animals are highlighted. these include: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae; carbapenemase-producing bacteria; bovine respiratory tract pathogens, such as pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica, which harbor the multiresistance mediating integrative and conjugative element icepmu1; gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that carry the multiresistance gene cfr; and the occurrence of numerous novel antimicrobial resistance genes in livestock-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the emergence of the aforementioned resistance properties is mainly based on the exchange of mobile genetic elements that carry the respective resistance genes.

TI  == potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  == a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli o8, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, streptococcus suis, listeria monocytogenes and pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. in adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of b. subtilis jt143 and l. acidophilus ly24 respectively isolated from bioplus((r))2b and florafit((r)) probiotics (p < 0.05). the adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2,  48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. the survival rate of b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. the strain was fully resistant to ph 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. the safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. these results implied that that the new strain of b. coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI  == ceftaroline versus isolates from animal bite wounds: comparative in vitro activities against 243 isolates, including 156 pasteurella species isolates.
AB  == more than 5 million americans are bitten by animals, usually dogs, annually. bite patients comprise approximately 1% of all patients who visit emergency departments (300,000/year), and approximately 10,000 require hospitalization and  intravenous antibiotics. ceftaroline is the bioactive component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, which is fda approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis), including those containing methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). there are no in vitro data about the activity of ceftaroline against pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida  and pasteurella multocida subsp. septica, other pasteurella spp., or other bite wound isolates. we therefore studied the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against 243 animal bite isolates. mics were determined using the broth microdilution method according to clsi guidelines. comparator drugs included cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, ampicillin-sulbactam, azithromycin, doxycycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (smx-tmp). ceftaroline was the most active agent against all 5 pasteurella species, including p. multocida subsp. multocida and p. multocida subsp. septica, with a maximum mic of </=0.008 mug/ml; more active than ceftriaxone and ertapenem (mic(90)s, </=0.015 mug/ml); and more active than cefazolin (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) doxycycline (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml), azithromycin (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), ampicillin-sulbactam (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml), and smx-tmp  (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml). ceftaroline was also very active against all s. aureus isolates (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml) and other staphylococcus and streptococcus species, with a maximum mic of 0.125 mug/ml against all bite isolates tested. ceftaroline has potential clinical utility against infections involving p. multocida, other pasteurella species, and aerobic gram-positive isolates, including s. aureus.

TI  == susceptibility of canine and feline bacterial pathogens to pradofloxacin and comparison with other fluoroquinolones approved for companion animals.
AB  == in this study, 908 bacterial pathogens from defined infections of dogs and cats were tested for their susceptibility to the novel fluoroquinolone pradofloxacin,  which was approved in 2011 for use in cats and dogs. most of the bacteria tested  (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus pseudintermedius, escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci, pasteurella multocida and bordetella bronchiseptica) exhibited low pradofloxacin mic(90) values of </= 0.25 mug/ml. solely proteus spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa had higher mic(90) values of >/= 4 mug/ml. only six (3.4%) of 177 s. pseudintermedius and 12 (5.3%) of 227 e. coli isolates showed pradofloxacin mics of >/= 2 mug/ml. analysis of the quinolone resistance determining regions of the target genes identified double mutations in gyra that resulted in amino acid exchanges s83l+d87n or s83l+d87y and single or double mutations in parc that resulted in amino acid exchanges s80i or s80i+e84g  in all 12 e. coli isolates. the six s. pseudintermedius isolates exhibited amino  acid exchanges s84l or e88k in gyra and s80i in grla. comparative analysis of the mics of pradofloxacin and the mics determined for enrofloxacin and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin, but also marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, difloxacin and ibafloxacin was conducted for the target pathogens s. pseudintermedius, e. coli and p. multocida. this comparison confirmed that pradofloxacin mics were significantly lower than those of the other tested fluoroquinolones.

TI  == an atypical presentation of a pasteurella multocida infection following a cat bite: a case report.
AB  == pasteurella multocida is a bacterial organism that commonly causes cellulitis after animal bites, especially cat bites. we report an unusual vesiculopustular infection of the hand following a domestic cat bite. pasteurella multocida and staphylococcus aureus were cultured from the wound and the patient was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium. further history revealed that the patient's cat had nibbled on her hand. pasteurella usually is resistant to many of the typical empiric antibiotics used to treat skin infections. amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium (500 mg 3 times daily) is the treatment of choice for patients who have an infected cat or dog bite with no known bacterial  cause. a thorough patient history is needed to promptly arrive at a proper diagnosis for an atypical presentation of a common disease.

TI  == functional analysis and induction of four novel goose (anser cygnoides) avian beta-defensins in response to salmonella enteritidis infection.
AB  == in the current study, four novel avian beta-defensins (avbds) (avbd2, 5, 9, and 10) were identified in tissues from the chinese goose (anser cygnoides). the antibacterial activity of the avbds showed that all of these avbds exhibited antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria investigated (p<0.01). in addition, antibacterial activity of all of the avbds against staphylococcus aureus and pasteurella multocida decreased significantly or was completely abolished at 150mm nacl (p<0.01). none of the avbds showed hemolytic activity. avbd2 and avbd10 were expressed widely, whereas avbd5 and avbd9 mrnas were expressed in a limited number of geese tissues. avbd9 was significantly induced in some immune tissues from geese after salmonella enteritidis infection. the others were significantly upregulated in small intestine and some immune tissues  of the geese (p<0.01). the present results suggest that the avbds are part of the host defense mechanism of the goose.

TI  == bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  == pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined  against clinical isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species. a subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. for 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin mbc was within two doubling dilutions of the mic. for the remaining strains, the mic and mbc were within three to four doubling dilutions. pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the mbc was equal to the mic for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. as pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal  effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/ml. the bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as  low as 0.125 mug/ml. in conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of mbc and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. it is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. these data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.

TI  == psoas abscess due to pasteurella multocida.
AB  == psoas abscess is a pus collection within the muscle compartment. it is a very uncommon entity. it can be primary as a result of haematogenous spread or secondary as a consequence of a direct extension of an infectious focus. diagnosis is usually delayed because nonspecific clinical presentation. staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism cultured in this type of abscess. we describe a secondary psoas abscess in an elderly female patient. the  patient presented with fever, right groin pain and malaise. following laboratory, radiological and microbiological analyses the patient was diagnosed as having a psoas abscess due to pasteurella multocida, which is a gram negative bacteria, part of the normal oral flora of many animals and can causes human infections after animal scratches or bites. more rarely is to find this organism causing psoas abscesses. because of insidious clinical presentation, the diagnosis of psoas abscess is a challenge and a high index of suspicion is required. we emphasize the importance of bacteriological confirmation of microorganism involved to choose the correct antibiotics. percutaneous drainage is the treatment of choice. open surgical drainage should be reserved if percutaneous drainage fails.

TI  == survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in europe.
AB  == a monitoring programme conducted in europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (brd) cases between 2002 and 2008. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. for respiratory pathogens, pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (mic</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of m haemolytica strains were resistant (mic>/=4  microg/ml). histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). mycoplasma bovis mic (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. for mastitis pathogens, the majority of escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568  and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with mic centred on 0.25 microg/ml.  streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with mic centred on 1 microg/ml. marbofloxacin mic for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published mic results.

TI  == expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -12 in porcine lung infections.
AB  == matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) play a variety of roles during organogenesis, in the immune response and during acute and chronic diseases as well as in tissue remodelling. during the last decade, the pig has become used increasingly as a model for human diseases; however, studies on the expression of porcine mmps are  limited. in the present study species-specific antibodies were produced to investigate the expression of mmp-9 and mmp-12 immunohistochemically in lungs from pigs infected with actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida and staphylococcus aureus. the immunolabelling of lung tissues (one infected and  one control pig representing each infection) was evaluated for cellular distribution and intensity, which was scored semiquantitatively. when compared with healthy, non-infected controls, the expression of both mmp-9 and mmp-12 was  higher in infected lungs. the highest expressions were seen in the alveolar epithelium (mmp-9) and alveolar macrophages (mmp-12). these results are in accordance with studies of human lungs.

TI  == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

TI  == plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  == florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in  pigs caused by strains of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to  be marginal for diseases caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/ml. an experiment was conducted during september and october 2009. one hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (landrace-yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. they  were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by hplc. considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. however, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with mic breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/ml. decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with mic >0.25 mug/ml, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of streptococcus  suis or e. coli to this drug.

TI  == microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == the tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. the goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. aerobic cultivation identified pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. for culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16s rrna sequences using the ribosomal database project pipeline programs developed at michigan state university. dominant genera identified by 16s rrna analysis in pigs from both herds included actinobacillus,  haemophilus, pasteurella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and prevotella. these genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. in contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. in addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. this is the first analysis using 16s rrna sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in  the porcine upper respiratory tract.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.

TI  == acute infection of a total knee arthroplasty caused by pasteurella multocida: a case report and a comprehensive review of the literature in the last 10 years.
AB  == total knee arthroplasty (tka) infection are most commonly due staphylococcus aureus followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci, and streptococci, while gram-negative rods are seldom isolated.(1,3,4) in the last 20 years, cases of pasteurella multocida tka and total hip arthroplasty (tha) infection resulting from cat and dog bites, scratches, or licks have been published reporting varying presentations and treatment options. most commonly, p. multocida infected arthroplasties result in local tenderness, cellulitis, and purulent discharge followed by regional adenopathy, and in immunocompromised patients it may progress to septicemia, meningitis, and septic arthritis.(5) treatment antibiotics include penicillins or 2nd and 3rd generation cephalosporins, and surgical options involve one-stage, or two-stage revision arthroplasties.(6,9,17,19) we report a case of p. multocida tka infection in a patient who was treated successfully with a 3rd generation cephalosporin, synovectomy and tibial interspacer exchange, along with a review of the literature published in the last 10 years. our findings show that there is usually a history of exposure to the animal, early appearance of cat bite related infections, and multifactorial decision making for the treatment of p. multocida  joint infections.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel antibacterial peptide, avian beta-defensin 2 from ducks.
AB  == in this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (avbd) was isolated from duck pancreas. the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained an 195 bp open reading frame encoding 64 amino acids. homology, characterization and comparison  of the gene with avbd from other avian species confirmed that it was duck avbd2.  the mrna expression of the gene was analyzed in 17 tissues from 21-day-old ducks. avbd2 was highly expressed in the trachea, crop, heart, bone marrow, and pancreas; moderately expressed in the muscular stomach, small intestine, kidney,  spleen, thymus, and bursa of fabricius; and weakly expressed in skin. we produced and purified recombinant avbd2 by expressing the gene in escherichia coli. as expected, the recombinant peptide exhibited strong bactericidal properties against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and pasteurella multocida, and weak bactericidal properties against e. coli and salmonella choleraesuis. in addition, the recombinant protein retained antimicrobial activity against s. aureus under different temperatures (range, -20 degrees c to 100 degrees c) and ph values (range, 3 to 12).

TI  == bite-related and septic syndromes caused by cats and dogs.
AB  == bite infections can contain a mix of anaerobes and aerobes from the patient's skin and the animal's oral cavity, including species of pasteurella, streptococcus, fusobacterium, and capnocytophaga. domestic cat and dog bite wounds can produce substantial morbidity and often require specialised care techniques and specific antibiotic therapy. bite wounds can be complicated by sepsis. disseminated infections, particularly those caused by capnocytophaga canimorsus and pasteurella multocida, can lead to septic shock, meningitis, endocarditis, and other severe sequelae. an emerging syndrome in veterinary and human medicine is meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections shared between pets and human handlers, particularly community-acquired mrsa disease involving the usa300 clone. skin, soft-tissue, and surgical infections are the most common. mrsa-associated infections in pets are typically acquired from their owners and can potentially cycle between pets and their human acquaintances.

TI  == alternative method for genetic transformation of pasteurella multocida x73 using  a hyaluronidase-producing staphylococcus aureus strain.
AB  == the hyaluronic acid-rich capsules make affected bacteria relatively retractile to transformation. in this work, native hyaluronidase produced in situ by staphylococcus aureus, was investigated to replace the pure enzyme in bacterial capsule depolymerization and its subsequent genetic transformation. the encapsulated pasteurella multocida x73 was cultivated as a mixed culture with a hyaluronidase-producing strain of s. aureus. then different concentrations (50 ng and 200 ng) of the pasteurella-escherichia coli shuttle vector ppba1100 were electro-transformed into 40 microl of the mentioned culture. recombinants were selected on nutrient agar supplemented with 50 microg/ml of kanamycine (kan). the effects of a capsule-weakening agent on electroporation rates were also evaluated. the use of this technique has allowed us to attain transformation frequencies 10(5) times higher than a previously available protocol using pure enzyme. a control experiment involving a non-hyaluronidase-producing strain s. aureus substantiated the effect of the staphylococcal enzyme. the proposed alternative method could be also used for genetic transformation for other capsulated bacteria, which is not possible without pure hyaluronidase.

TI  == antibiograms of pathogenic bacteria isolated from laboratory rabbits in ibadan, nigeria.
AB  == antibiotic sensitivity patterns of 21 bacterial isolates from some clinically ill new zealand rabbits were evaluated against 12 commonly used antibiotics by the kirby-bauer disk-diffusion sensitivity testing method. the 21 isolates consisted  of six bordetella bronchiseptica, eight pasteurella multocida, four staphylococcus aureus and three pseudomonas alcaligenes that were associated with snuffles, pneumonia, otitis media, genital infections and conjunctivitis in these groups of caged rabbits. the four bacteria species were all sensitive to kanamycin, gentamycin and enrofloxacin, with variable sensitivity to the other antibiotics tested. the results of this antibiogram could serve as a field guide  in the treatment of very acute bacterial diseases of rabbit prior to the availability of the results of local sensitivity tests. such sensitivity tests should be reviewed yearly to update this antibiogram.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle in different european countries: 2002-2004.
AB  == background: the project "antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - ii" (arbao-ii) was funded by the european union (fair5-qlk2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-2005, with the aim to establish a continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among veterinary laboratories in european countries  based on validated and harmonised methodologies. available summary data of the susceptibility testing of the bacterial pathogens from the different laboratories were collected. method: antimicrobial susceptibility data for several bovine pathogens were obtained over a three year period (2002-2004). each year the participating laboratories were requested to fill in excel-file templates with national summary data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance from different bacterial species.a proficiency test (eqas - external quality assurance system) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted each year to test  the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the participating laboratories. the data from this testing demonstrated that for the species included in the eqas the results are comparable between countries. results: data  from 25,241 isolates were collected from 13 european countries. for staphylococcus aureus from bovine mastitis major differences were apparent in the occurrence of resistance between countries and between the different antimicrobial agents tested. the highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin. for mannheimia haemolytica resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide were observed in france, the netherlands and portugal.  all isolates of pasteurella multocida isolated in finland and most of those from  denmark, england (and wales), italy and sweden were susceptible to the majority of the antimicrobials. streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis isolates from sweden were fully susceptible. for the other countries some resistance was observed to tetracycline, gentamicin and erythromycin. more resistance and variation of the resistance levels between countries were observed for escherichia coli compared to the other bacterial species investigated. conclusion: in general, isolates from denmark, england (and wales), the netherlands, norway, sweden and switzerland showed low frequencies of resistance, whereas many isolates from belgium, france, italy, latvia and spain were resistant to most antimicrobials tested. in the future, data on the prevalence of resistance should be used to develop guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine.

TI  == terpenoid compositions, and antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the rhizome essential oils of different hedychium species.
AB  == a phytochemical study of the rhizome essential oils of four different hedychium species was performed by means of gc and gc/ms analyses. h. ellipticum mainly contained 1,8-cineole, sabinene, and terpin-4-ol, while h. aurantiacum possessed  terpin-4-ol, para-cymene, and bornyl acetate as the major entities. similarly, trans-meta-mentha-2,8-diene and linalool were noticed in h. coronarium. three different collections (i-iii) of h. spicatum showed amazing differences in the relative contents of their essential oils, 1,8-cineole and 10-epi-gamma-eudesmol  being identified as markers for samples i and ii, terpin-4-ol and sabinene being  the major compounds in sample iii. the rhizome essential oils of the above species were studied for their antioxidant activities by different methods, including their effect on the chelating properties of fe(2+), dpph radical-scavenging activity, and reducing power. antimicrobial screenings of the  oils by the paper-disc method were performed against staphylococcus aureus, shigella flexneri, pasteurella multocida, escherichia coli, and salmonella enterica enterica, and the respective minimum-inhibitory-concentration (mic) values were determined. the rhizome essential oils from all hedychium species exhibited moderate-to-good fe(2+) chelating activity. h. spicatum from collection site iii showed a completely different dpph radical-scavenging profile than the samples from the other collection sites.

TI  == quantitative resistance level (mic) of bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., staphylococcus aureus) isolated from chickens and turkeys: national resistance monitoring by the bvl 2004/2005.
AB  == in the study 2004/2005, the current quantitative resistance level of escherichia  coli, pasteurella multocida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp. and staphylococcus aureus from chickens and turkeys was determined for the first time within the framework of the national resistance monitoring of the federal office  of consumer protection and food safety (bvl). the objective was to implement a valid database on the basis of which the development and spread of resistance can be evaluated and monitored. during the investigation period from january 2004 to  february 2005,927 strains were collected and 857 (92%) bacteria strains which corresponded to the specifications of the study protocol were tested with the broth microdilution method to determine the in vitro susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration) to 22 to 28 antimicrobial agents or antibiotic combinations. the results document a prevalence of resistance that exceeds that of bacterial pathogens of other animal species, especially in the case of tetracycline. apart for s. aureus, clinical resistance to fluoroquinolones can still be considered low in poultry pathogens (e. coli approx. 2%). by applying the micg of 4 mg/l for enrofloxacin, a susceptibility of approximately 78 % was calculated for s. aureus. a comparison of the prevalence of resistance between chickens and turkeys, showed that a slightly higher prevalence of resistance can  be expected in turkeys. differences between the susceptibility data of chicks and adult animals could only be found in turkeys. in the case of e. coli, the prevalence of resistance of strains isolated from adult turkeys was up to 10% higher than those isolated from chicks for the corresponding antimicrobial agents. it must be pointed out that the number of e. coli strains from adult turkeys was much higher (n = 194) than the number from turkey chicks (n = 21). the results indicate clearly that in a resistance monitoring system it is necessary to categorise poultry by animal species (chicken, turkey) as well as by production stage and type (broiler, laying hen), so that the epidemiology of resistance can be correctly represented and evaluated. this information is the basis for the development of long-term management options for minimizing antibiotic resistance. furthermore, the knowledge of prevailing resistance levels in germany is a valuable tool for veterinary practitioners when determining an empirical therapy. the data collected by the bvl make an important contribution to the optimisation of the safety of food from animals, and thus to improving consumer protection.

TI  == prevalence of zoonotic agents in dogs visiting hospitalized people in ontario: implications for infection control.
AB  == visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. this cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents  in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across ontario. between may and july 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. one specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. all dogs were judged to be in good health. zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. the primary pathogen was clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase e. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the  genus salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. pasteurella multocida or pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while toxocara canis and ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, campylobacter spp., microsporum canis, group a streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.

AB  == animal bite wounds and their subsequent infection are relatively common. incidence rates for dog bites are significantly higher among children aged 0-9 years, especially among boys. although bite wounds may initially look innocuous,  they frequently lead to serious infection with a potential for life-threatening complications. the microbiology of dog bite wounds is usually polymicrobial, typically including anaerobes, staphylococcus aureus and pasteurella species. a case is described of a 22-month-old boy who, subsequent to a dog bite over the left maxilla, suffered infection of the dental follicle of the primary maxillary  canine with pasteurella multocida. the infection proved difficult to treat, requiring several attempts at incision and drainage of the abscess together with  systemic antibiotics, and resulted in the eventual loss of the tooth.

TI  == facial bite wounds: management update.
AB  == bite wounds are frequently located on the face; injuries inflicted by dogs are most common, especially in children. bacteriology of infected dog and cat bite wounds includes pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, capnocytophaga canimorsus, and oral anaerobes. infected human bites yield a similar spectrum of bacteria except for pasteurellae and c. canimorsus; instead human bites are frequently complicated by eikenella corrodens. antibiotic therapy against these bacteria is indicated both for infected bite wounds and fresh wounds considered at risk for infection. amoxicillin-clavulanate (and other combinations of extended-spectrum penicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors) and moxifloxacin offer the best in vitro coverage of the pathogenic flora. initial wound management consisting in irrigation and debridement is at least equally important with antibiotics for prevention of infection. the need for prophylaxis  against systemic infectious complications, particularly tetanus, should also be evaluated. primary surgical repair is the treatment of choice for most clinically uninfected facial bite wounds, whereas delayed closure should be reserved for certain high risk or already infected wounds. avulsive injuries with significant  tissue loss represent the most difficult cases for definitive management and are  also those most likely to require hospitalization.

TI  == [surgical therapy for hand infections. part i].
AB  == due to its function, anatomy, and exposition to multiple pathogens, the hand is highly susceptible to infection. most of these infections are post-traumatic. isolates of pathogens from infected hands contain mainly staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic group a streptococci. we find pasteurella canis and p. multocida from cat and dog bite wounds and eikenella corrodens from human bite wounds. the "fight-bite clenched fist" wound, with penetration of the metacarpophalangeal joint and its high risk of septic arthritis, has always to be suspected when patients present with human bites. the therapy of hand infection is based on three principles: surgical treatment, adequate antimicrobial therapy, and early physiotherapy. early infectious conditions of the hand, e.g. cellulitis and early paronychia, may be treated without surgery. antimicrobial treatment must be specific for the pathogen and its resistance to antimicrobial agents. bite wounds should be treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors. staphylococci and streptococci can be covered by first and second generation cephalosporins. the increasing resistance of staphylococci to antibiotics has to be taken into account. infections with anaerobic and gas-producing bacteria are rare but occur predominantly in diabetics and immune-compromised individuals.

TI  == [bite wound infections].
AB  == background: the lifetime risk of experiencing a bite wound, human or animal, is approximately 50%, and bite wounds account for approximately 1% of all visits to  emergency departments. the majority of bite wounds are inflicted by dogs and cats. material and methods: a review of the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of bite wound infections is presented. results: the most common pathogens associated with bite wounds are streptococcus species, staphylococcus species, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus and anaerobic bacteria. sporadically other pathogens are isolated from bite wounds. human bites differ from animal bites by higher prevalence of staphylococcus aureus and eikenella corrodens. interpretation: it is important to be aware of the possibility of complicating infections following bite wounds, particularly after cat bites. phenoxymethyl penicillin should be the drug of choice in treatment of infections  associated with cat and dog bites. however, in case of slow recovery or no improvement, simultaneous lymphadenopathy or pneumonia, s. aureus or francisella  tularensis should be suspected; ciprofloxacin is recommended. for human bite infections the recommend treatment is phenoxymethyl penicillin in combination with penicillinase-stable penicillin.

TI  == seven years survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of bovine pathogenic strains from eight european countries.
AB  == this study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). strains originated in bovine diseases from eight european countries. they were isolated from gut infections (escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus somnus). there was no change in the mic distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. in e. coli, a resistant population was present before the  use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. over this period the only a significant change seen  was an increase in mic(90) of e. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995  to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). all the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a mic(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. the use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.

AB  == the authors studied the bacterial flora of the dog oral cavity and of bite wounds, aerobic bacteria were isolated from mouth swabs of 16 normal and 5 rabid  dogs as well as from infected dog-bite wounds from 18 patients. a total of 20 different microbial species were recovered from mouth swab cultures. the most frequently isolated organisms were klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pasteurella species. there were no differences in the aerobic bacterial flora between rabid and nonrabid dogs. from  the cultures of the bite wound swabs, the authors found that almost all of the organisms identified were part of the normal oral flora of the dog. one or more aerobic bacteria were isolated from the infected dog-bite wounds. two patients had four, 3 had three, 4 had two, and 6 had one of the nine organisms in their wounds. the predominant species of bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds  were, as follows: staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, moraxella species, pasteurella canis, and enterobacter cloacae. however, three wound cultures had no aerobic bacterial growth. the results of this study show that the infected bite wounds may contain a mixed bacterial flora that colonize human skin and the oral cavity of dogs.

TI  == [experimental empyema in rats through intrapleural injection of bacteria]
AB  == objective: to evaluate empyema formation in rats through the injection of two bacteria (pasteurella multocida and staphylococcus aureus), using a simple, easy-to-use surgical technique. methods: twenty four anesthetized wistar white rats, 250-300g in weight, submitted to right anterior thoracotomy, muscular retraction and injection of a 0.2ml solution into pleural space according the following scheme: group i (n=12): injection of 10(10) pasteurella multocida cultured in brain heart infusion broth. group ii (n=8): injection of 10(10) staphylococcus aureus cultured in brain heart infusion broth. group iii (n=4): injection of bacterium-free brain heart infusion (control). the rats were sacrificed after seven days, and pleural reaction was assessed by macroscopy. mortality, and intrathoracic liquid volume were evaluated, and bacteriological tests were also performed. results: seven rats died within the first 48 hours in  group i (pasteurella multocida); five completed the experiment, but none of them  presented empyema. only one animal died within the first 24 hours in group ii (staphylococcus aureus); seven (88%) presented empyema at the time of sacrifice.  all animals survived in group iii (control), without empyema or thoracic abnormalities. pleural inoculation of staphylococcus aureus (group ii) was significantly associated with empyema formation (p<0.001). in this group, the amount of pleural liquid ranged from 0.9 to 3.9ml. conclusion: it is possible to  induce empyema in rats through staphylococcus aureus pleural injection by a simple surgical technique. differently from other experiments, the pleural injection of pasteurella multocida did not provoke empyema in rats.

TI  == variability of neutrophil and pulmonary alveolar macrophage function in swine.
AB  == neutrophils and alveolar macrophages are essential defence mechanisms against bacterial infection of the lung. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the variability of a panel of neutrophil and alveolar macrophage function assays in swine, and to determine if the function of these leukocytes differed at various stages of production. measured neutrophil functions included chemotaxis, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and degranulation. phagocytosis and oxidative burst were measured in alveolar macrophages isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage  fluid (balf). both neutrophil and alveolar macrophage functions were highly variable from day-to-day and between pigs. individual pigs did not have consistently high or low neutrophil and macrophage responses over time when compared to their cohorts. older grower-finisher pigs had significantly greater neutrophil oxidative burst responses than younger suckling and weaner pigs (p < 0.001). similarly, alveolar macrophages from suckling and early weaner pigs less  than 40 days of age had significantly lower oxidative burst responses than those  from older pigs (p = 0.02). age-related variation in phagocytosis, chemotaxis, or granule secretion were not detected. these results establish baseline data for individual and age-related variation in swine leukocyte function, and form a basis for further evaluation of the contribution of non-infectious factors to development of the porcine respiratory disease complex.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  == the skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. resident gram-positive  bacteria include staphylococcus, micrococcus, and corynebacterium sp. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. in order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. epidermal infections caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. the pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. moreover, s. aureus and s. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus, bartonella sp., klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.

TI  == [the current antimicrobial resistance situation in swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight swiss laboratories from may 1999 to february 2000. using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial  species: escherichia coli, salmonella, haemophilus parasuis, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, bordetella bronchiseptica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, streptococci, and enterococci. differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in e. coli and salmonella. some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. a significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. this includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in e. coli. a similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic  acid. staphylococci from dogs (s. intermedius and s. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in switzerland is relatively favorable.

TI  == recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  == macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia, campylobacter spp, branhamella spp, pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and s.  pyogenes are found in france and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. ru 004, hmr 3647, and te  802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. research at abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-o-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. bacterial resistance ( such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. the new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. this presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.

TI  == effects of enrofloxacin on porcine phagocytic function.
AB  == the interaction between enrofloxacin and porcine phagocytes was studied with clinically relevant concentrations of enrofloxacin. enrofloxacin accumulated in phagocytes, with cellular concentration/extracellular concentration ratios of 9 for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) and 5 for alveolar macrophages (ams). cells with accumulated enrofloxacin brought into enrofloxacin-free medium released approximately 80% (ams) to 90% (pmns) of their enrofloxacin within the first 10 min, after which no further release was seen. enrofloxacin affected neither the viability of pmns and ams nor the chemotaxis of pmns at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 microg/ml. enrofloxacin (0.5 microg/ml) did not alter the capability of pmns and ams to phagocytize fluorescent microparticles or actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, and staphylococcus aureus. significant differences in intracellular killing were seen with enrofloxacin at 5x the mic compared with that for controls not treated with  enrofloxacin. pmns killed all s. aureus isolates in 3 h with or without enrofloxacin. intracellular s. aureus isolates in ams were less susceptible than  extracellular s. aureus isolates to the bactericidal effect of enrofloxacin. p. multocida was not phagocytosed by pmns. ams did not kill p. multocida, and similar intra- and extracellular reductions of p. multocida isolates by enrofloxacin were found. intraphagocytic killing of a. pleuropneumoniae was significantly enhanced by enrofloxacin at 5x the mic in both pmns and ams. ams are very susceptible to the a. pleuropneumoniae cytotoxin. this suggests that in  serologically naive pigs the enhancing effect of enrofloxacin on the bactericidal action of pmns may have clinical relevance.

TI  == targeting lurking pathogens in acute traumatic and chronic wounds.
AB  == the appropriate antimicrobial treatment for skin and soft tissue following acute  trauma is determined by the mechanism of injury, time from injury to treatment, environmental wound contamination, pathogenicity of colonizing bacteria, and patient-specific issues. these factors can be used to predict the risk of secondary infection of wounds. although common skin pathogens (such as staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococcus) cause most secondary wound infections, antibiotic therapy sometimes must be directed against unusual pathogens that are associated with atypical wounds, such as animal bites (amoxicillin with clavulanate for pasteurella multocida) and plantar puncture wounds (ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa). this customized treatment approach is also appropriate for chronic wounds, such as pressure and diabetic foot ulcers. in addition to antibiotic therapy, wound management may include surgical debridement. active areas of investigation in wound management include the use of growth factors and hyperbaric oxygen.

AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  == siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of  the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter  inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the  intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or  lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated  to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.

AB  == a novel antimicrobial agent from staphylococcus aureus ksi1829, designated bac1829, was purified by sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation, sephadex g-50 gel filtration chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. purified bac1829 has a molecular mass of 6,418 +/- 2 da. the peptide in heat stable, since full biological activity is retained after heating  at 95 degrees c for 15 min, and it is destroyed by digestion with proteases. amino acid sequence analysis revealed a high concentration of ala and gly residues, which respectively comprised 24 and 19% of the total amino acid content. additionally, high levels of hydrophobic amino acids were present, accounting for the hydrophobic nature of bac1829. purified bac1829 killed exponentially growing corynebacterium renale in a dose-dependent manner by a bactericidal mode of action. a partial inhibitory spectrum analysis revealed that the following organisms were sensitive to the inhibitory activity of bac1829: s.  aureus rn4220, streptococcus suis, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, c. renale, corynebacterium diptheriae, haemophilus parasuis, bordetella pertussis, bordetella bronchoseptica, moraxella bovis, and pasteurella multocida.

TI  == [are nasal swabs for swine appropriate for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia agents?].
AB  == nasal swabs and lungs of 150 pigs with pneumonia were tested by culture at post mortem examination. the isolated agents were pasteurella multocida (p.m.), p. haemolytica, bordetella bronchiseptica, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp. and escherichia coli. p.m. was most frequently found, and this agent only showed a significant correlation between lungs and nasal swabs. in 80.6% of pigs with p.m. in the lung the agent was detected in the nose, too. drug resistance patterns of p.m. isolates from lungs and noses of the single animals were identical or similar, also in case of different capsular types. the examination of porcine nasal swabs for bacteria capable of causing pneumonia should be limited to p. multocida. demonstration of  agents in lung material is generally more certain.

TI  == antibacterial activity of marbofloxacin. a new fluoroquinolone for veterinary use against canine and feline isolates.
AB  == marbofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone developed exclusively for veterinary use.  minimum inhibitory concentrations of marbofloxacin were assessed for 816 recent isolates associated with canine or feline diseases. marbofloxacin showed a broad  spectrum of activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. in vitro rates of killing of marbofloxacin and enrofloxacin were compared against strains  of staphylococcus intermedius and pasteurella multocida, and the results showed no marked difference between the two antibiotics. the duration of bactericidal activity was evaluated ex vivo in the urine of dogs and cats treated with marbofloxacin and lasted from 2 to 5 days after a single administration according to the dosages. post-antibiotic effect durations were determined with escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus intermedius and were found almost equal to those of enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. these results predict a great potential for marbofloxacin in the treatment of a wide range of diseases in dogs and cats.

TI  == capsular hyaluronic acid in pasteurella multocida type a and its counterpart in type d.
AB  == hyaluronic acid was demonstrated in the capsule extract of 39/39 pasteurella multocida type a strains by sodium chloride gradient chromatography followed by alcian blue staining, and by a turbidometric method using acidified horse serum.  treatment with hyaluronidase from various sources eliminated these reactions. an  alcian blue staining substance of closely similar chromatographic properties occurred in capsule extracts of 14/16 type d strains but it resisted hyaluronidase and was thought to be an acidic polysaccharide differing from the hyaluronic acid of type a. turbidometric values were lower than with type a strains, but were unaltered by hyaluronidase treatment. the type d substance could be precipitated from capsule extract by acriflavin. both type a and d strains were mucoid and displayed large capsule zones in stained preparations. photomicrographic measurements showed that hyaluronidase treatment of cell suspensions markedly reduced capsule dimensions of type a but not type d strains. when type a strains were cross streaked against a hyaluronidase + staphylococcus  aureus, their growth became non-mucoid at the intersection: mucoid type d strains were unaffected. neither hyaluronic acid nor the hyaluronidase resistant type d substance could be detected in type b or e strains.

TI  == leishmania major: bacterial contamination of cutaneous lesions in experimental animals.
AB  == no bacterial contamination has been demonstrated in cutaneous leishmaniasis (cl)  nodule and in lesions caused by leishmania major in balb/c mice up to 20 days after infection. however, although many phagocytic cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages) were present in the cl lesion, 80% of the lesions showed bacterial contamination that developed within the first 70 days of infection. topical treatment of the lesion with an ointment containing 15% paromomycin and 12% methylbenzethonium chloride in soft white paraffin for 20 days eliminated all the leishmania parasites and several of the associated bacteria including: proteus vulgaris, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus albus and staphylococcus aureus. this treatment did not affect escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. total elimination of these bacteria was achieved only during the healing process, and within 20 days following termination of treatment. the rate of disappearance of bacteria inoculated alone  into the base of the tail of normal uninfected balb/c mice was much faster than that of bacteria inoculated into either the cl nodule or the cl lesion. this study suggests the development of local immunosuppression in the cl lesion that may be mediated by the leishmania parasites and their metabolites.

TI  == bite wounds and infection.
AB  == one of every two americans will be bitten by an animal or by another person at some point. bites account for approximately 1% of all visits to emergency rooms;  injuries inflicted by dogs are most common. the bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds include pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  intermedius, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, capnocytophaga canimorsus, and other members of the oral flora. anaerobic bacteria are present in approximately one-third of bite wounds and are associated with the formation of abscesses and with relatively serious infections. p. multocida is found in infections of cat bites more than 50% of the time. the bacteriology of bite wounds inflicted by exotic animals reflects the animals' oral flora. bites inflicted by humans are often more serious than those inflicted by animals. infections of human bites are associated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci, s. aureus, eikenella corrodens, haemophilus species, and (in more than 50% of cases) anaerobic bacteria. the principles of management of bite wounds are discussed.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  == the etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., pasteurella multocida. while anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. in a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. several species of anaerobes usually were present in the  wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. the anaerobes most commonly isolated included bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, bacteroides ruminicola, bacteroides pneumosintes, bacteroides ureolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium russii, peptococcus species,  peptostreptococcus species, and veillonella species. initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.

TI  == effect of type a pasteurella multocida fractions on bovine polymorphonuclear leukocyte functions.
AB  == the effect of various pasteurella multocida fractions on bovine polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) functions was examined in vitro by using two encapsulated strains, p-2383 and p-1062 (both are carter capsular type a and of bovine origin). the ability of pmns to ingest staphylococcus aureus and iodinate protein was significantly inhibited in the presence of live cells, heat-killed whole cells, or saline-extracted capsules but not in the presence of the decapsulated heat-killed cells. none of the fractions of the two strains inhibited nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by pmns. the saline extract did not inhibit the binding of  iodine to protein by a reaction involving xanthine, xanthine oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase. the pmn inhibitory factor was further characterized as a  heat-stable capsular material of greater than 300,000 molecular weight.

TI  == evaluation of a selective medium for isolation of haemophilus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  == crystal violet, lincomycin, spectinomycin and bacitracin were evaluated as selective agents in media for isolation of haemophilus pleuropneumoniae. no single antimicrobial agent or combination of two or more inhibited all non-haemophilus strains (escherichia coli, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus equisimilis and staphylococcus aureus) without marked suppression of 16 h. pleuropneumoniae strains. a medium containing 1 micrograms/ml of crystal violet, 1 microgram/ml of lincomycin, 8 micrograms/ml of spectinomycin and 128 micrograms/ml of bacitracin inhibited one  e. coli strain and the gram-positive strains while h. pleuropneumoniae strains were suppressed to a minor degree only. haemophilus pleuropneumoniae was isolated on the selective medium on three occasions from the nose or pharynx of two out of eight experimentally inoculated pigs. haemophilus pleuropneumoniae was recovered  from the nose of only two pigs at necropsy and from tonsil of one, whereas the lower airways in most pigs and the lung lesions in all pigs were positive. there  was no advantage to using the selective medium for the recovery of h. pleuropneumoniae at necropsy from these eight experimentally infected pigs, probably because other bacteria were absent or present in very low numbers in the tissues with h. pleuropneumoniae. the isolation rate on selective medium was higher than the rate on non-selective medium (p less than or equal to 0.1; chi 2  test) when the airways of slaughtered pigs were cultured. this was likely due to  a high degree of contamination. dry swabs placed in tryptone yeast extract with nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide gave a significantly higher recovery rate than  commercial culturette swabs in modified stuart's transport medium.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == leishmania braziliensis: effects of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and pasteurella multocida) on the developing cutaneous leishmaniasis lesion in the golden hamster.
AB  == experimentally induced lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis and the effect of concurrent bacterial infection on the development of these lesions were studied in the golden hamster. male outbred golden hamsters received intradermal injections at the base of the tail with approximately 10(7) promastigotes of leishmania braziliensis panamensis, or promastigotes combined with staphylococcus aureus or pasteurella multocida or both, bacteria only, or sterile eagle's minimal essential medium (meme). the size of the resulting lesions was measured at least twice each week. hamsters were killed at postinoculation days 6, 13, 20, 27, 41, or 48, and each lesion was measured, aseptically excised, and bisected; half was used for bacteriologic culture and the other half was prepared for light microscopic examination. lesions resulting from l. b. panamensis alone progressed from initial erythema to a granulomatous nodule and finally to a necrotic granuloma, often capped by a crateriform ulcer. lesions resulting from a suspension of l. b. panamensis with added s. aureus or s. aureus and p. multocida, were initially larger, more erythemic and contained a greater proportion of neutrophils up to postinoculation days 14-21 than did lesions resulting from l. b. panamensis alone. concurrent infections with bacteria such as s. aureus and p. multocida had little effect on the development of ulcerating  characteristics of lesions, but when s. aureus was present it appeared to enhance the severity of the early lesions. between postinoculation days 14-28, lesions produced by l. b. panamensis, with or without added bacteria had similar developmental progression of sufficient size for optimal testing of antileishmanial compounds.

TI  == cross-reactivity of haemophilus somnus antibody in agglutination and complement fixation tests and in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  == the specificity and sensitivity of agglutination, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) procedures in the detection of antibodies to haemophilus somnus was investigated. h. somnus rabbit immune sera were found to agglutinate pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus agni and, in some instances, also pasteurella haemolytica, salmonella dublin, streptococcus agalactiae, and corynebacterium pyogenes. in complement fixation tests with saline extracts as antigens, only h. agni reacted with h. somnus antisera to any significant degree. in elisa tests with sonicated or heat-extracted antigens, cross-reactions were seen with the two pasteurella spp.  and with h. agni. when whole cells and saline extracts were used as antigens in elisas, only h. agni showed any cross-reactivity. the greatest specificity in distinguishing homologous from heterologous reactions was achieved by elisa with  saline extracts as antigens. escherichia coli and brucella abortus antigens failed to react with h. somnus antibody in any of the tests. a rabbit serum containing antibody to bovine type isolates of p. multocida, p. haemolytica, s. aureus, s. agalactiae, s. dublin, c. pyogenes, and e. coli gave no positive reaction in elisa tests with saline extract of h. somnus as antigen. it is concluded that such saline extract, which appears to consist largely of h. somnus common antigen, has the potential of being a useful diagnostic reagent in the study by elisa of antibody response to h. somnus.

TI  == [intrauterine bacterial and mycotic infections in cows].
AB  == bacteriologic, mycologic, and serologic investigations of cows and calves and three experiments with rabbits were carried out to shed light on the bacteriology and mycology of the intrauterine infections in cows. the following organisms were isolated from the investigated cows that exhibited disturbances in their reproduction, and had abortions, or gave birth to calves that were affected with  diseases or died: escherichia coli (17.84%), association of bacteria (7.64%); vibrio genitalis (3.86%); streptococcus sp. (2.78%); moulds (2.54%); staphylococcus aureus (2.20%); proteus sp. (1.62%); staphylococcus epidermidis (1.39%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.39%); pasteurella multocida (0.11%). the serologic investigation of a total of 231 blood samples from cows that miscarried, gave birth to dead calves, or failed to conceive revealed that in 15.58 per cent there was vibriosis, and in 6.06 per cent--leptospirosis. demonstrated was the etiologic link between cows with reproductive disturbances and diseased calves with regard to vibriosis and leptospirosis. the tests with rabbits were indicative of bacterial carriers (with special reference to the genitalia) up to the 60th day following infection. there were abortions, sterility, and death cases and the birth of unviable bunnies in the case of reproduced coital infections with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == preliminary clinical pharmacological investigations of tylosin and tiamulin in chickens.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of tiamulin and tylosin for mycoplasma, gram-positive, and gram-negative micro-organisms isolated from chickens were determinated by the agar dilution method. median mic values for tiamulin against mycoplasma gallisepticum (0.05 microgram/ml) and mycoplasma synoviae (0.10 microgram/ml) were 2 to 4 times lower than the corresponding values for tylosin. tiamulin was also slightly more effective in vitro in inhibiting escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, and beta-haemolytic streptococci than was tylosin. groups of chicken were offered tiamulin medicated  drinking water at rates of 125 and 250 mg/litre for 48 hours. average serum tiamulin concentrations were 0.38 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. when tylosin tartrate was added to the drinking water at 500 and 700 mg/litre, average serum drug levels were 0.12 and 0.17 microgram/ml, respectively. tiamulin was 45% bound in chicken serum, as against 30% serum protein binding for tylosin. correlations were made between free (non protein bound) serum drug levels and the mic values of the two drugs. such comparisons suggest that when tiamulin is given in the drinking water at rates of 125 to 250 mg/litre, better antimycoplasmal activity is to be expected in vivo than by giving tylosin tartrate in the drinking water at 500 to 700 mg/litre. based on these data, no clinical efficacy  of these dose rates can be expected in flocks infected by gram-negative micro-organisms such as e. coli or p. multocida. the tylosin tartrate rate of 500 to 700 mg/litre, may be clinical ineffective the treatment of staphylococcus aureus infections.

TI  == dog bite wounds and infection: a prospective clinical study.
AB  == we prospectively studied 26 patients with 27 dog bite wounds who sought medical attention in the emergency department. two distinct populations were found (fishers exact test, p less than or equal to 0.001): 1) those who presented 8 hr  to 12 hr post-injury were concerned about rabies or tetanus or surgical wound repair; and 2) those who presented more than 12 hr post-injury were concerned with infection. there was no difference (p > 0.05) in the bacteriology of the two groups. of all wounds, 74% had aerobic pathogens isolated, including streptococcus viridans (12 strains), staphylococcus aureus (five strains), and pasteurella multocida (eight strains); 41% had anaerobic pathogens isolated, including bacteriodes species (five strains) and fusobacterium species (five strains). gram stains made from wound swabs were specific but insensitive predictor for bacterial growth. empiric outpatient therapy with oral penicillin (17 patients) and/or dicloxacillin (four patients) was effective.

TI  == mammalian bite wounds.
AB  == clinical data were collected prospectively from a series of 160 patients presenting with mammalian bite wounds. anaerobic and aerobic cultures were prepared from sterile swabs placed in 65 bite wounds prior to cleansing. infection was noted in 11 of 22 cat bites, six of 37 human bites, three of 80 dog bites, and in none of the 21 bites caused by other mammals. pasteurella multocida was recovered from six infected cat and dog bites, all of which developed infection within 24 hours of injury. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans were the principal pathogens isolated from the remaining infected cat, dog, and human bites. infection most commonly followed puncture wounds caused by  cats (10/19) and lacerations into subcutaneous tissue of the hand caused by humans (4/17). none of the 10 sutured wounds became infected. all infected bite wounds responded to antibiotic therapy. no conclusions regarding the value of prophylactic antibiotics could be made.

TI  == diverse effects of bursectomy on humoral immune responses in the chicken.
AB  == chickens bursectomized hormonally or surgically at various ages in embryonic to postembryonic lives were immunized with a mixture of antigens, and the antibodies produced titrated. immune responses to salmonella pullorum (sp), brucella abortus (ba). staphylococcus aureus (staph) and ovalbumin (oa) were more markedly suppressed by the bursal deprivation than those to heterogenous erythrocytes, viruses and such bacteria as pasteurella multocida (pm) and escherichia coli b. the immune response to bovine serum albumin (bsa) was on a level between the two  groups. hormonal bursectomy in embryonic life permitted chickens immunized with sheep red blood cells (srbc) to produce antibody of the igm type but not of the igg type. in surgically bursectomized chickens igg but not igm production was inhibited. chickens hormonally bursectomized on the third day of egg incubation produced igm to a level higher than the normal chickens in contrast with the suppressed igg production. such diversity in the bursal influences on antibody responses was discussed in relation to ontogeny of the humoral immune system.

TI  == carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin.
AB  == carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin, is active against a broad spectrum of bacterial species. although the ester has in vitro antimicrobial activity per se when evaluated in brain heart infusion broth, the in vivo antibacterial activity seen in mice and rats reflects primarily the efficient hydrolysis of the ester to carbenicillin. with an acute systemic infection in mice as a test system, orally administered carbenicillin indanyl sodium protected mice against lethal infections produced by escherichia coli, salmonella choleraesuis, pasteurella multocida, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus  aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the dose that protected 50% of the animals against each of these infections was comparable to that of parenteral carbenicillin. against experimental urinary-tract disease in rats produced by e.  coli, p. vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was again observed that carbenicillin indanyl sodium provided activity comparable to that of parenterally administered carbenicillin.

AB  == sixteen cows were used in a series of experiments to test dose, route and frequency responses in the production of milk and serum agglutinins to a spectrum of 9 proven bovine pathogens. the bacterial species were: pasteurella multocida (2 isolates), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus albus, streptococcus sp., corynebacterium sp., salmonella enteriditis, and aerobacter aerogenes. primary immunizations were made either through the teat canal or intramuscularly. "booster" injections were made through the teat canal. agglutinins in the blood appeared only after a week or more. in the milk, titers  were recorded in 1 or 2 days following primary immunization. variation of titer in the blood and milk was somewhat independent. in all but 1 cow, antibody was produced against each organism in milk and blood serum. udder inflammation was observed in the experiments when a 15-day interval separated immunizations. inflammation was minimal in the experiments employing the 7-day interval of immunization. a positive whiteside test was observed following most injections, even where no other clinical signs of reaction were seen. the findings are discussed in relation to the previous literature.
