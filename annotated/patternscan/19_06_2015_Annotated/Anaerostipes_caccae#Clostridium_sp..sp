TI  == anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov., an anaerobic, butyrate-producing bacterium from clostridium cluster xiva isolated from broiler chicken caecal content, and emended description of the genus anaerostipes.
AB  == four butyrate-producing isolates were obtained from the caecal content of a 4-week-old broiler chicken. the 16s rrna gene sequences were determined and confirmed the close relatedness of the four isolates, which suggested that they were derived from a single bacterial clone. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences showed that its closest relatives were members of cluster xiva of the clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria and that the closest  related type strain was anaerostipes caccae l1-92(t) (94.5 % similarity). similarity levels of 96-98 % with sequences from uncultured bacteria from human stool samples were observed. on the basis of morphological, biochemical and phylogenetic characteristics, this strain is assigned to a novel species in the genus anaerostipes, for which the name anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is 35-7(t) (=lmg 24724(t) =dsm 22094(t)). an emended description of the genus anaerostipes is also provided.

TI  == anaerostipes caccae gen. nov., sp. nov., a new saccharolytic, acetate-utilising,  butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  == two strains of a previously undescribed eubacterium-like bacterium were isolated  from human faeces. the strains are gram-variable, obligately anaerobic, catalase  negative, asporogenous rod-shaped cells which produced acetate, butyrate and lactate as the end products of glucose metabolism. the two isolates displayed 99.9% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to each other and treeing analysis demonstrated the faecal isolates are far removed from eubacterium sensu stricto and that they represent a new subline within the clostridium coccoides group of organisms. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic criteria, it is proposed that the two strains from faeces be classified as a new genus and species, anaerostipes caccae. the type strain of anaerostipes caccae is ncimb 13811t (= dsm 14662t).
