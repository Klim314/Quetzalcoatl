TI  == could beta-hemolytic, group b enterococcus faecalis be mistaken for streptococcus agalactiae?
AB  == a beta-hemolytic enterococcus faecalis strain agglutinating lancefield group a, b, c, d, f, and g antisera was observed from a rectovaginal swab, in the context  of antenatal screening for streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]). this is the first multi-lancefield antisera-agglutinating isolate of this species, and it raised particular concern, as it may mimic gbs, leading to false  reporting and useless receipt of intrapartum antibiotics.

TI  == [analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  == objective: to study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. method: a retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of yuying children's hospital of wenzhou medical university seen from january 1, 2004 to december 31, 2013. the clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. result: among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). in 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were gram-negative bacteria. the five most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%),  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns, 20 cases, 17.9%), streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%),  staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. escherichia coli was the most common  bacterium, followed by streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, p < 0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, p < 0.05). streptococcus (most were streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset  meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, p < 0.05). drug sensitivity tests showed that all the gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. staphylococci were  resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of cns isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. no streptococcus and enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. none of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. among the gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. there were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by streptococcus died. conclusion:  escherichia coli, cns and streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. there were increasing numbers of cases with streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.

TI  == the effect of indomethacin and betamethasone on the cytokine response of human neonatal mononuclear cells to gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == intrauterine infections with gram-positive bacteria pose a serious threat to neonates since they can result in neonatal sepsis, induce a fetal inflammatory response and also cause preterm birth. despite intensive care, prematurity remains a leading cause of neonatal death, and is often accompanied by a number of morbidities. in order to prevent premature birth, tocolytic agents like indomethacin are administered. betamethasone is used to promote lung maturation and prevent respiratory distress syndrome. a combination of both drugs is assumed to prevent premature delivery while simultaneously facilitating lung maturation.  this study investigates the effect of betamethasone, indomethacin and a combination of both on the cytokine production of neonatal cord blood mononuclear cells (cbmc) after stimulation with lysates of the gram-positive pathogens streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis. the aim of the study is to determine the impact of these drugs on the function of the neonatal immune system which should aid clinicians in choosing the optimal therapy in case of preterm birth associated with intrauterine infection. betamethasone reduced the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6, il-12p40, mip-1alpha and tnf and increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10, depending on the pathogen used for stimulation. in contrast to betamethasone, indomethacin  almost exclusively increased il-10 production. the combination of both drugs decreased the expression of il-6, il-12p40, mip-1alpha and tnf while increasing il-10 production, depending on the concentration of indomethacin and the pathogen used for stimulation. based on our results, the combination therapy with indomethacin and betamethasone has a similar effect on cytokine production as betamethasone alone, which is generally administered in case of impending preterm birth. however, the combination therapy has the advantage of promoting lung maturation while simultaneously blocking preterm labor effectively.

TI  == update of the telavancin activity in vitro tested against a worldwide collection  of gram-positive clinical isolates (2013), when applying the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  == a revised broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for telavancin was approved by the food and drug administration (fda). telavancin activity was assessed against gram-positive pathogens collected worldwide (2013) using the revised method. a total of 12,346 isolates from 90 sites were included as part of the telavancin international surveillance program for the americas, europe, and asia-pacific. telavancin had mic50 and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml, respectively, against staphylococci, regardless of methicillin susceptibility, and inhibited all staphylococcus aureus at </=0.12 mug/ml (revised fda breakpoint). telavancin was 8-fold more active than daptomycin (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and 16- to 32-fold more active than vancomycin (mic50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) and linezolid (mic50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. all 692 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml) at </=0.25 mug/ml (fda breakpoint), except for 1 strain (mic, 0.5 mug/ml). all enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis with telavancin mic values of >/=0.5 and >/=1 mug/ml, respectively, had a vana phenotype. a comparison data analysis based on the mic90 demonstrated that telavancin was at least 8-fold more potent than comparators against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. streptococci showed telavancin mic50 values of </=0.015 mug/ml, except for streptococcus agalactiae (mic50, 0.03 mug/ml). these in vitro results obtained by the recently approved susceptibility testing method establish a new benchmark of telavancin activity worldwide.

TI  == antibacterial compounds from salvia adenophora fernald (lamiaceae).
AB  == from the aerial parts of salvia adenophora fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. the structures were established by extensive 1d, 2d nmr and hresi-tofms spectroscopic methods. finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ecd spectra. despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against s. epidermidis. interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. no action was reported on gram-negative strains nor on candida albicans. these results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.

TI  == activity of oritavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in european and us hospitals (2010-13).
AB  == objectives: to assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) in european and us hospitals. methods: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for sstis were included. isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in europe (israel included) and the usa, respectively, between 2010  and 2013. results: oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal mic, mic50 and mic90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus. cons from the usa (mic50, 0.015 mg/l) demonstrated an mic50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from europe (mic50, 0.03 mg/l). overall, vancomycin-resistant (vana-phenotype) enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin mics  (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (mic50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/l; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all vana e. faecalis at </=0.5  mg/l. equivalent oritavancin mics (mic50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/l) were noted for all vanb and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, while higher mics (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l) were obtained for vana strains. oritavancin had low mics against the overall populations of streptococcus pyogenes (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the streptococcus anginosus group (mic50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher mics for streptococcus dysgalactiae (mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/l; >/=98.3% susceptible). conclusions: oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of european and us isolates causing sstis. these results describe oritavancin activity against gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the usa.

TI  == plasma components and platelet activation are essential for the antimicrobial properties of autologous platelet-rich plasma: an in vitro study.
AB  == autologous platelet concentrates are successfully adopted in a variety of medical fields to stimulate bone and soft tissue regeneration. the rationale for their use consists in the delivery of a wide range of platelet-derived bioactive molecules that promotes wound healing. in addition, antimicrobial properties of platelet concentrates have been pointed out. in this study, the effect of the platelet concentration, of the activation step and of the presence of plasmatic components on the antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma was investigated against gram positive bacteria isolated from oral cavity. the antibacterial activity, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration, was determined through the microdilution two-fold serial method. results seem to suggest that the antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus aureus is sustained by a co-operation between plasma components and platelet-derived factors and that the activation of coagulation is a fundamental step. the findings of this study may have practical implications in the modality of application of platelet concentrates.

TI  == construction of a chimeric lysin ply187n-v12c with extended lytic activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  == developing chimeric lysins with a wide lytic spectrum would be important for treating some infections caused by multiple pathogenic bacteria. in the present work, a novel chimeric lysin (ply187n-v12c) was constructed by fusing the catalytic domain (ply187n) of the bacteriophage lysin ply187 with the cell binding domain (146-314aa, v12c) of the lysin plyv12. the results showed that the chimeric lysin ply187n-v12c had not only lytic activity similar to ply187n against staphylococcal strains but also extended its lytic activity to streptococci and enterococci, such as streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, which ply187n could not lyse. our work demonstrated that generating novel chimeric lysins with an extended lytic spectrum was feasible through fusing a catalytic domain with a cell-binding domain from lysins with lytic spectra across multiple genera.

TI  == development of a multiplex real-time pcr assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  == the diagnosis of late onset sepsis (los), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by pcr would provide a much more timely result. unfortunately, pcr-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. therefore we developed a real-time multiplex pcr assay tailored to los diagnosis  which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. species-specific pcr assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp. and serratia marcescens. the pcr assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (lod) of </=10cfueq./reaction. these lod values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial dna was isolated from blood. clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex pcr and blood culture. in conclusion, we developed a multiplex pcr that allows the direct detection of the most important  bacterial pathogens causing los in preterm infants.

TI  == vang element insertions within a conserved chromosomal site conferring vancomycin resistance to streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == three vancomycin-resistant streptococcal strains carrying vang elements (two invasive streptococcus agalactiae isolates [gbs-ny and gbs-nm, both serotype ii and multilocus sequence type 22] and one streptococcus anginosus [sa]) were examined. the 45,585-bp elements found within sa and gbs-ny were nearly identical (together designated vang-1) and shared near-identity over an ~15-kb overlap with a previously described vang element from enterococcus faecalis. unexpectedly, vang-1 shared much less homology with the 49,321-bp vang-2 element from gbs-nm, with widely different levels (50% to 99%) of sequence identity shared among 44 related open reading frames. immediately adjacent to both vang-1 and vang-2 were  44,670-bp and 44,680-bp integrative conjugative element (ice)-like sequences, designated ice-r, that were nearly identical in the two group b streptococcal (gbs) strains. the dual vang and ice-r elements from both gbs strains were inserted at the same position, between bases 1328 and 1329, within the identical  rna methyltransferase (ruma) genes. a genbank search revealed that although most  gbs strains contained insertions within this specific site, only sequence type 22 (st22) gbs strains contained highly related ice-r derivatives. the vang-1 element in sa was also inserted within this position corresponding to its ruma homolog adjacent to an ice-r derivative. vang-1 insertions were previously reported within the same relative position in the e. faecalis ruma homolog. an ice-r sequence perfectly conserved with respect to its counterpart in gbs-ny was apparent within the same site of the ruma homolog of a streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain. additionally, homologous vang-like elements within the conserved ruma target site were evident in roseburia intestinalis. importance: these three streptococcal strains represent the first known vancomycin-resistant  strains of their species. the collective observations made from these strains reveal a specific hot spot for insertional elements that is conserved between streptococci and different gram-positive species. the two gbs strains potentially represent a gbs lineage that is predisposed to insertion of vang elements.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility among gram-positive organisms collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) was designed to monitor  global longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents, including tigecycline. in this study, we examine susceptibility among gram-positive isolates collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011. a total of 9,422 gram-positive isolates were contributed by 1,255 centers, predominantly from europe and north america. one-third of staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, peaking in prevalence in 2007. all s. aureus isolates (n = 3,614) were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin; minocycline, imipenem, and meropenem were also highly active (>92% susceptibility). ampicillin and penicillin susceptibility increased significantly during the study period (p < 0.0001 for both). streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 3,373) were highly susceptible to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (>99%), and levofloxacin and tigecycline (both >96%); imipenem susceptibility was low (32%) in africa while minocycline susceptibility was low in asia-pacific rim (38%). penicillin resistance occurred  in one-fifth of all s. pneumoniae isolates, with penicillin susceptibility ranging from 14% in africa to 65% in europe. streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 1,056) were highly susceptible to most antimicrobials, although only 16% were susceptible to minocycline. enterococcus faecalis isolates (n = 1,112) were highly susceptible (>97%) to ampicillin, linezolid, penicillin, tigecycline, and  vancomycin globally, but only 34% were minocycline susceptible; minocycline susceptibility decreased significantly from 2004 to 2011 (p < 0.001). tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against enterococcus faecium (n = 267) globally  (100% and 98% susceptible, respectively). tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against gram-positive pathogens from pediatric patients in test 2004 to 2011, with vancomycin and the carbapenems performing well against most pathogens.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma against microorganisms isolated from oral cavity.
AB  == background: autologous platelet concentrates (pcs) have been extensively used in  a variety of medical fields to promote soft and hard tissue regeneration. the significance behind their use lies in the abundance of growth factors in platelets alpha-granules that promotes wound healing. in addition, antibacterial  properties of pcs against various bacteria have been recently pointed out. in this study, the antimicrobial effect of pure platelet-rich plasma (p-prp) was evaluated against oral cavity microorganisms such as enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. blood samples were obtained from 17 patients who underwent oral surgery procedures involving the use of p-prp. the antibacterial activity of p-prp, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), was determined through the microdilution twofold serial method. results: p-prp inhibited the growth of enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus oralis, but not of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. conclusions: p-prp is a potentially useful substance in the fight against postoperative infections. this might represent a valuable property in adjunct to the enhancement of tissue regeneration.

TI  == assessment of a semi-automated protocol for multiplex analysis of sepsis-causing  bacteria with spiked whole blood samples.
AB  == sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. rapid and reliable diagnostic methods are needed for efficient and evidence-based treatment of septic patients. recently, new molecular tools have emerged to complement the  conventional culture-based diagnostic methods. in this study, we used spiked whole blood samples to evaluate together two ready-to-use molecular solutions for the detection of sepsis-causing bacteria. we spiked whole blood with bacterial species relevant in sepsis and extracted bacterial dna with the nordiag arrow device, using the selectna blood pathogen dna isolation kit. dna extracts were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr)- and microarray-based prove-it bone and joint assay, resulting in correctly identified bacterial species with detection limits of 11-600 colony-forming unit/ml (cfu/ml). to understand the recovery losses of bacterial dna during the sample preparation step and the capability of the pcr- and microarray-based platform to respond to the sensitivity requirements, we also determined the analytical sensitivity of the pcr and microarray platform to be 1-21 genome equivalents for the tested bacterial species. in addition, the inclusivity of the prove-it bone and joint assay was demonstrated with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) clones carrying sccmec types i, ii, iv, or v and a nontypable sccmec type. the proof-of-concept for accurate multiplex pathogen and antibacterial resistance marker detection from spiked whole blood samples was demonstrated by the selective bacterial dna extraction method combined with the high-throughput pcr-  and microarray-based platform. further investigations are needed to study the promising potential of the concept for sensitive, semi-automated identification of sepsis-causing pathogens directly from whole blood.

TI  == update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the usa: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2011).
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. dal potency was assessed in the 2011 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9  us census regions. monitored gram-positive cocci included staphylococcus aureus (sa; 1,036/50.4% mrsa), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 115), enterococcus faecalis (25), e. faecium (31), streptococcus pyogenes (155), streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (vgs; 40). all susceptibility (s) testing used clinical and laboratory standards institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. dal (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/ml) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (dap) and vancomycin (van), respectively against sa, with mssa and mrsa having the same mic(90) results. cons was slightly more dal-s (mic(50), </=0.03mug/ml). the highest staphylococcal dal mic was only 0.25 mug/ml. beta-haemolytic streptococci (betahs) and vgs had dal mic results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/ml (mic(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/ml), and only enterococci showed elevated dal mic results. vana phenotype-resistant e. faecalis or e. faecium had dal mic values at >/=1 mug/ml; vanb strains were dal-s (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). all cited dal quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of mic creep. in conclusion, year 2011 sentry program data for dal documents sustained potent activity against sa, cons, betahs, vgs, and van-s  enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than van, dap, or linezolid.

TI  == comparing effects of freezing at -196 degrees c and -20 degrees c on the viability of mastitis pathogens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the effects of cryopreservation at approximately -196 degrees c in liquid nitrogen (n) and freezing at approximately -20 degrees c in a freezer, on the viability and survival of eight different mastitogenic bacteria inoculated in milk. bacteria were frozen at approximately -20 degrees c in a freezer and cryopreserved at approximately -196 degrees c in liquid nitrogen. an effective preservation method was needed for follow-up samples from cows identified in the south african national milk recording scheme  (nmrs) with somatic cell counts above 250 000 cells/ml milk. the organisation responsible for sample collection of the nmrs milk samples also provides producers with liquid nitrogen for their semen flasks at the collection sites. this existing mode of storage and transport could therefore be utilised.ten samples of each organism were thawed and cultured bi-weekly until week 18 for both temperature treatments. an additional sampling was performed at week 30 for  samples frozen at approximately -20 degrees c. freezing and cryopreservation did  not impair subsequent isolation of streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus (sth) (phage type lytic group iii) or sta. aureus (sta) (phage typed, other than lytic group iii). survival was indicated by the isolation of bacteria from samples, and viability by the strength of growth of the bacteria isolated. the survival of streptococcus agalactiae decreased after week 12 and escherichia coli after week 16 of freezing, but both organisms survived under cryogenic preservation until week 18. coagulase-negative staphylococci survived until week 18 for both freezing and cryogenic preservation.both storage methods could thus contribute to the improvement of a pro-active approach towards udder health management in south african dairy herds.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  == we investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it  is now a clinical problem in japan. six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). major causative bacteria detected were escherichia coli (65.0 %), enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). from 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were e. coli (61.5 %), e. faecalis (13.7 %), k. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and s. agalactiae (4.0 %). the sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and cephems of e. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. in regard to infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [lvfx] >/=4 mug/ml), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of fq administration within 1 month. although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. the major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli were a history of fq administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. it was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of fq administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.

TI  == protection against staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == type 1 lipoteichoic acid (lta) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against lta have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated enterococcus faecalis strains. in the present study, we show that antibodies against e. faecalis lta also bind to type 1 lta from other gram-positive species  and opsonized staphylocccus epidermidis and staphylcoccus aureus strains as well  as group b streptococci. inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against e. faecalis lta promoted the clearance of bacteremia by e. faecalis and s. epidermidis in mice. furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine s. aureus peritonitis model. the effectiveness of rabbit antibody against lta suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB  == purpose: collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. in order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to  investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents  present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. methods: in a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from january 2009 to october 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the department of obstetrics and gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. all the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. cultures for common bacteria, neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. results: the most  frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. in particular, streptococci were  found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (enterococcus faecalis  and escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. u. urealyticum was detected  in 10% and mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). no cases of n. gonorrhoeae were found. conclusions: cervical culture has a low concordance with  endometrial culture. in fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in  the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. these results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == cross-resistance to lincosamides, streptogramins a, and pleuromutilins due to the lsa(c) gene in streptococcus agalactiae ucn70.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae ucn70, isolated from a vaginal swab obtained in new zealand, is resistant to lincosamides and streptogramins a (ls(a) phenotype) and  also to tiamulin (a pleuromutilin). by whole-genome sequencing, we identified a 5,224-bp chromosomal extra-element that comprised a 1,479-bp open reading frame coding for an abc protein (492 amino acids) 45% identical to lsa(a), a protein related to intrinsic ls(a) resistance in enterococcus faecalis. expression of this novel gene, named lsa(c), in s. agalactiae bm132 after cloning led to an increase in mics of lincomycin (0.06 to 4 mug/ml), clindamycin (0.03 to 2 mug/ml), dalfopristin (2 to >32 mug/ml), and tiamulin (0.12 to 32 mug/ml), whereas no change in mics of erythromycin (0.06 mug/ml), azithromycin (0.03 mug/ml), spiramycin (0.25 mug/ml), telithromycin (0.03 mug/ml), and quinupristin  (8 mug/ml) was observed. the phenotype was renamed the ls(a)p phenotype on the basis of cross-resistance to lincosamides, streptogramins a, and pleuromutilins.  this gene was also identified in similar genetic environments in 17 other s. agalactiae clinical isolates from new zealand exhibiting the same ls(a)p phenotype, whereas it was absent in susceptible s. agalactiae strains. interestingly, this extra-element was bracketed by a 7-bp duplication of a target site (attagaa), suggesting that this structure was likely a mobile genetic element. in conclusion, we identified a novel gene, lsa(c), responsible for the acquired ls(a)p resistance phenotype in s. agalactiae. dissection of the biochemical basis of resistance, as well as demonstration of in vitro mobilization of lsa(c), remains to be performed.

TI  == nationwide survey of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections in japan (2008).
AB  == in this study, the causative bacteria and their sensitivity to various antimicrobial agents as well as risk factors for quinolone-resistant escherichia  coli were investigated in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis or complicated cystitis by isolation and culture of bacteria from urine samples. in  total, 1312 strains were isolated from 1009 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis, including e. coli (63.3%), enterococcus faecalis (12.8%) and streptococcus agalactiae (4.6%). in addition, 994 strains were isolated from 725  patients with complicated cystitis, including e. coli (36.4%), e. faecalis (19.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5.0%), s. agalactiae (4.7%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%). at least 90% of e. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis showed sensitivity to fluoroquinolones and cephems, whilst 70.4-88.4% of e. coli isolates from complicated cystitis were sensitive to fluoroquinolones and 85.4-89.5% were sensitive to cephems. factors associated with quinolone-resistant e. coli included two or more episodes of cystitis within 1 year, failure of quinolone therapy, underlying urinary tract disease, prior quinolone treatment within 1 month and age >/= 75 years. it is important to confirm the sensitivity of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empirical antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of e-101 solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == objectives: e-101 solution (e-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. it is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pmpo), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. e-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent  surgical site infections (ssis). the in vitro activity of e-101 was investigated. methods: mic, mbc, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to clsi guidelines with modifications. resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. results: e-101 showed mic(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pmpo/l for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. mic(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pmpo/l for enterobacteriaceae (n =  148) and gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. there was no antimicrobial tolerance to e-101 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae or streptococcus pyogenes. time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. there was no evidence of stable resistance to e-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli or p. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of e-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. conclusions e-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of ssis, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of ssis.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == novel plasmid-based genetic tools for the study of promoters and terminators in streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == promoter-probe and terminator-probe plasmid vectors make possible to rapidly examine whether particular sequences function as promoter or terminator signals in various genetic backgrounds and under diverse environmental stimuli. at present, such plasmid-based genetic tools are very scarce in the gram-positive pathogenic bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. hence, we developed novel promoter-probe and terminator-probe vectors based on the streptococcus agalactiae pmv158 plasmid, which replicates autonomously in numerous gram-positive bacteria. as reporter gene, a gfp allele encoding a variant of the green fluorescent protein was used. these genetic tools were shown to be suitable to assess the activity of promoters and terminators (both homologous and heterologous) in s. pneumoniae and e. faecalis. in addition, the promoter-probe vector was shown to be a valuable tool for the analysis of regulated promoters in vivo, such as the promoter of the pneumococcal fuculose kinase gene. these new plasmid vectors will be very useful for the experimental verification of predicted promoter and terminator sequences, as well as for the construction of new inducible-expression vectors. given the promiscuity exhibited by the pmv158 replicon, these vectors could be used in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == phenotyping and genotyping of streptococci in bovine milk in argentinean dairy herds.
AB  == most veterinary and milk hygiene laboratories identify streptococci and enterococci based on serological and biochemical tests. the analysis of 16s rdna  was suggested to be used for more exact identification; however, its use has not  been considered so far in monitoring studies. the objective of the present study  was to compare a conventional phenotypic method with restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis of 16s rdna (16s rdna rflp) for identification of streptococci isolated from composite milk samples collected in connection with intramammary infection (imi) in six argentinean dairy farms. composite milk samples (n = 1223) from cows belonging to six herds were collected for bacteriological analysis. twelve reference strains and fifty streptococci or streptococcuslike isolates were identified to species level by the api 20 strep system, conventional biochemical tests and 16s rdna rflp in a blind assay. the remaining streptococci or streptococcus-like isolates (n = 40) were identified to the species level both by 16s rdna rflp and conventional biochemical tests. as indicated by kappa values, agreement between the 16s rdna rflp and the conventional scheme for identification of streptococcus agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis, s. equinus and enterococcus faecalis was 0.91, 0.73, 0.92, 0.81 and 0.85, respectively. together with the less frequently isolated streptococcal species, the conventional scheme correctly identified 77 out of 90  isolates (85.5%). thus, the use of 16s rdna rflp is considered valuable for monitoring studies due to its affordable cost for standard laboratories.

TI  == biological activity of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata (schisandraceae) and its major components.
AB  == objectives: the aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. methods: the essential oil from stem bark of kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (glc/fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (glc/ms). the ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (dpph(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity.  inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin e(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. the in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (hepg2, mia paca-2, hela, hl-60, mda-mb-231 and sw-480) was examined using the mtt assay. key findings: fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. the oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested,  including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. streptococcus pyogenes and s. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 60 microg/ml  oil. the essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but  it did not show any activity against gram-negative bacteria. the essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in trypanosoma b. brucei with an ic50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. radical scavenging activity had an ic50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-lipoxygenase inhibition (ic50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin e(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. the oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against mia paca-2, hepg-2 and sw-480 cell lines with ic50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. the oil increased caspase 3/7  activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in mia paca-2 cells. camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. however, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity.  conclusions: this investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, k. longipedunculata, a traditionally used chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.

AB  == purpose: in vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of l. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated.  method: in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and mic determination. the in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the california mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. results: the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the  antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus and candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. in the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the california mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. the microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. the effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis conclusion: the results suggest possible therapeutic potential of l. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.

AB  == the tn916-like genetic element tn5251 is part of the composite conjugative transposon (ctn) tn5253 of streptococcus pneumoniae, a 64.5-kb chromosomal element originally called omega(cat-tet) bm6001. dna sequence analysis showed that tn5251 is 18 033-bp long and contains 22 orfs, 20 of which have the same direction of transcription. annotation was possible for 11 out of 22 orfs, including the tet(m) tetracycline resistance gene and int and xis involved in the integration/excision process. autonomous copies of tn5251 were generated during matings of tn5253-containing donors with s. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. tn5251 was shown to integrate at different sites in the bacterial chromosome. it  behaves as a fully functional ctn capable of independent conjugal transfer to a variety of bacterial species including s. pneumoniae, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, e. faecalis and bacillus subtilis. the excision of tn5251 produces a circular intermediate and a deletion  in tn5253 at a level of 1.2 copies per 10(5) chromosomes.

TI  == requirement of the lactobacillus casei maekr two-component system for l-malic acid utilization via a malic enzyme pathway.
AB  == lactobacillus casei can metabolize l-malic acid via malolactic enzyme (malolactic fermentation [mlf]) or malic enzyme (me). whereas utilization of l-malic acid via mlf does not support growth, the me pathway enables l. casei to grow on l-malic acid. in this work, we have identified in the genomes of l. casei strains bl23 and atcc 334 a cluster consisting of two diverging operons, maepe and maekr, encoding a putative malate transporter (maep), an me (maee), and a two-component  (tc) system belonging to the citrate family (maek and maer). homologous clusters  were identified in enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus uberis. our results show that me is essential for l-malic acid utilization in l. casei. furthermore, deletion of either the gene encoding the histidine kinase or the response regulator of the tc system resulted in the loss of the ability to grow on l-malic acid, thus indicating that the cognate tc system regulates and is essential for the expression of me. transcriptional analyses showed that expression of maee is induced in the presence of l-malic acid and repressed by glucose, whereas tc system expression was induced by l-malic acid and was not repressed by glucose. dnase i footprinting analysis showed that maer binds specifically to a set of direct repeats [5'-ttatt(a/t)aa-3'] in the mae promoter region. the location of the repeats strongly suggests that maer activates the expression of the diverging operons maepe and maekr where the first one is also subjected to carbon catabolite repression.

TI  == trends in udder health and emerging mastitogenic pathogens in south african dairy herds.
AB  == the aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse the results of milk samples  obtained from south african dairy herds during the period 1996 to april 2007 in order to identify possible trends in isolates of microorganisms and their pathogenicity under field conditions. milk samples were obtained from 7 of the 9  provinces in south africa where there are low numbers of dairy cows. although there is scientific limitation to a country wide survey, such as the variation in herd size, management skills, parity, milk yield, milking frequency and other parameters, the size of this database helps to give a fair indication of general  udder health in south africa. cytology and routine bacteriology were performed on 379,000 milk samples of lactating cows and bacteriology on 11,946 samples from non-lactating cows. according to the results obtained, mastitis did not decrease  in south africa over the test period. the prevalence of mastitis and teat canal infection was lowest in 2002. mastitis and teat canal infection increased from 2002 to 2006 from 8.1% and 24.1% to 15.4 and 30.0% respectively. the percentage of mastitogenic pathogens isolated from cows over these years also varied. previously unknown or almost eradicated mastitogenic pathogens such as alphabeta  haemolytic staphylococcus aureus which is thought to be of human origin, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus canis were responsible for numerous mastitis outbreaks seen in the test samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria in milk samples from both lactating and dry cows, followed by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae. although staphylococcus aureus remained the principal mastitogenic pathogen in south africa, owing to its chronic nature and resultant economic losses, most cases of mastitis were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. this finding increases the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (formerly described  as a minor pathogen) significantly. isolations of streptococcus agalactiae peaked between 2000 and 2005 and decreased again by 2007. coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates increased from 2002 and were still on the increase in 2007. streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus canis were  isolated more frequently from milk samples of lactating cows compared with dry cows, while enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from dry cow samples.

TI  == monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  == the objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (btm), as well as to clarify the  relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc). the purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for btscc at the population level. samples of btm were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. counts of specific mammary pathogens in btm samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. significant differences were documented in btscc between btm samples containing str. agalactiae, staph. aureus, and str. dysgalactiae and btm samples that were pathogen-free. geometric means of btscc associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall btscc (str. agalactiae 243 628; staph. aureus  205 610; str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). it follows that the somatic cell count (scc) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall btscc. environmental pathogens predominated in samples of btm with scc <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in btm samples with scc >300x103/ml. no correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and btscc. this study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of btm in relation to btscc is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.

TI  == [comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: sentry surveillance program, spain (2002-2006)].
AB  == introduction and objective: daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. in this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered  in 3 spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international sentry antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. the possible  therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of spanish susceptibility data. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed  by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. results: all the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. the highest mic values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. all staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. in addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against enterococcus faecalis. daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. viridans group isolates. the distribution of daptomycin mic values in s. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. conclusion: the sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in greece.
AB  == a total of 10420 gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to  daptomycin. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the broth microdilution method. daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (mic50) =  1mg/l and mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90) = 1.36 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic50 = 1.36 mg/l and mic90 = 1.90 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 = 0.12 mg/l and mic90 = 0.50mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50 = 0.09 mg/l and mic90 = 0.12 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.5 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50 = 0.50 mg/l and mic90 = 0.89 mg/l). resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. on the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic50 = 0.44 mg/l and mic90 = 0.78 mg/l) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.44 mg/l); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an mic > 1mg/l, which is the clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. for all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.

TI  == surfactants as microbicides and contraceptive agents: a systematic in vitro study.
AB  == background: the urgent need for cheap and easy-to-use protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases has stimulated considerable interest in the use of surfactants as microbicides, anti-viral, and  contraceptive agents in recent years. in the present study we report a systematic in vitro evaluation of the microbicidal, anti-viral and contraceptive potential of cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic surfactants. methodology/principal findings: toxicity was evaluated in mammalian columnar epithelial (mdck) cells, human sperm cells, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis. the inhibition of adenovirus and lentivirus infection of mdck cells was also tested. a homologous series of cationic surfactants, alkyl-n,n,n-trimethylammonium bromides (c(n)tab), with varying alkyl chains were  shown to be bactericidal and fungicidal at doses that were related to the surfactant critical micelle concentrations (cmc), all of them at concentrations significantly below the cmc. in general, bacteria were more susceptible to this surfactant group than c. albicans and this organism, in turn, was more susceptible than mdck cells. this suggests that the c(n)tab may be useful as vaginal disinfectants only in so far as bacterial and fungal infections are concerned. none of the surfactants examined, including those that have been used  in pre-clinical studies, showed inhibition of adenovirus or lentivirus infection  of mdck cells or spermicidal activity at doses that were sub-toxic to mdck cells. conclusions/significance: the results of this study lead us to propose that systematic analysis of surfactant toxicity, such as we report in the present work, be made a mandatory pre-condition for the use of these substances in pre-clinical animal and/or human studies.

TI  == the establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == [antibiotics susceptibility of streptococcus and enterococcus: data of onerba network].
AB  == this work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae), or in  animals (streptococcus suis and streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. data were recorded since 1996 through the onerba networks. s. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. however, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in s. pyogenes. in 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. a similar trend was observed for s. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals s. suis and s. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. in enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in e. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of e. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. from 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in french hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. however, the  recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in french hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. such trend in macrolide resistance among s. pyogenes or s. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.

TI  == placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in latvia.
AB  == background: to investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (rti) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. methods: in a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae  (gbs), staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis (gds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). at delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta  was studied. results: some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had rti or endogenous vaginal flora. placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract  colonisation with g. vaginalis (p =0.013), bv (p =0.031), s. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). bv and bv-related g. vaginalis correlated with the  presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. genital tract colonisation with gds and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other rtis (p =0.023). conclusion: histological  placental inflammation is associated with both bv and genital tract colonisation  with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == c-terminal wxl domain mediates cell wall binding in enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == analysis of the genome sequence of enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate v583 revealed novel genes encoding surface proteins. twenty-seven of these proteins, annotated as having unknown functions, possess a putative n-terminal signal peptide and a conserved c-terminal region characterized by a novel conserved domain designated wxl. proteins having similar characteristics were also detected in other low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesized that the wxl region might be a determinant of bacterial cell location. this hypothesis was tested by generating protein fusions between the c-terminal regions of two wxl proteins in e. faecalis and a nuclease reporter protein. we demonstrated that the c-terminal regions of both proteins conferred a cell surface localization to the  reporter fusions in e. faecalis. this localization was eliminated by introducing  specific deletions into the domains. interestingly, exogenously added protein fusions displayed binding to whole cells of various gram-positive bacteria. we also showed that the peptidoglycan was a binding ligand for wxl domain attachment to the cell surface and that neither proteins nor carbohydrates were necessary for binding. based on our findings, we propose that the wxl region is a novel cell wall binding domain in e. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
AB  == in most organisms, glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and gsh synthetase (gs). in streptococcus agalactiae, gsh synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-gcs-gs). the n-terminal sequence of gamma-gcs-gs is similar to escherichia coli gamma-gcs, but the c-terminal sequence is an atp-grasp domain more similar to d-ala, d-ala ligase than to any known gs. in the present studies, c-terminally and n-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-gcs and gs domains, respectively. although wt gamma-gcs-gs is nearly uninhibited by gsh (k(i) approximately 140 mm), shorter gamma-gcs domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (k(i) approximately 15 mm), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-gcs enzymes. because studies with e. coli gamma-gcs implicate a flexible loop region in gsh binding, chimeras of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs were made containing gamma-gcs domain flexible loop sequences from enterococcus faecalis and pasteurella multocida gamma-gcs-gs, isoforms that are inhibited by gsh. inhibition remained s. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). c-terminal constructs of gamma-gcs-gs have gs activity (0.01-0.04% of wt), but proper folding and significant gs activity required a covalently linked gamma-gcs domain. in addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-gcs-gs sequence established that gs activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-gcs domain. our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-gcs-gs and suggest gamma-gcs-gs evolved from a monomeric gamma-gcs that became c-terminally fused to a multimeric atp-grasp protein.

TI  == modified gc medium for identification of group b streptococci.
AB  == the modified gc medium (mgc) was developed for identification of beta-hemolytic group b streptococci. this medium was developed on the basis of enhancing-pigment production of group b streptococci. three hundred and thirty isolates were tested including 180 isolates of beta-hemolytic group b streptococci, 102 isolates of beta-hemolytic non-group b streptococci, and 48 isolates of enterococcus faecalis. all isolates of group b streptococci gave carotenoid pigment by this medium. on the other hand, all of non-group b streptococci and e. faecalis did not show pigment after 72 h incubation. the specificity and sensitivity of mgc was 100%. there were no false positive and false negative in this medium. the mgc may be the alternative of choice for the presumptive identification of group b streptococci.

TI  == capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the ph range 2-5 in a dynamically modified fs capillary with uv detection.
AB  == the isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the ph range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. in this work, we suggest a cief method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the ph range of 2-5. it includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). this polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of  acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient cief. in order to trace of ph gradients, low-molecular-mass pi markers were used. the mixed cultures of microorganisms, escherichia coli ccm 3954, candida albicans ccm 8180, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, ccm 8223, proteus vulgaris, klebsiela pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus ccm 3953, streptococcus agalactiae ccm 6187, enterococcus faecalis ccm 4224 and staphylococcus epidermidis ccm 4418, were focused and separated by the cief method suggested here. this cief method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).

TI  == the traa relaxase autoregulates the putative type iv secretion-like system encoded by the broad-host-range streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pip501.
AB  == the conjugative multiple antibiotic resistance plasmid pip501 can be transferred  and stably maintained in a variety of gram-positive genera, including multicellular streptomyces lividans, as well as in gram-negative escherichia coli. the 15 putative pip501 transfer (tra) genes are organized in an operon-like structure terminating in a strong transcriptional terminator. this paper reports  co-transcription of the pip501 tra genes in exponentially growing enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 cells, as shown by rt-pcr. the tra genes are expressed throughout  the life cycle of ent. faecalis, and the expression level is independent of the growth phase. electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the traa relaxase, the first gene of the tra operon, binds to the tra promoter p(tra), which partially overlaps with the origin of transfer (orit). dnase i footprinting experiments further delimited the traa binding region and defined the nucleotides bound by traa. beta-galactosidase assays with p(tra)-lacz fusions proved p(tra) promoter activity, which was strongly repressed when traa was supplied in trans.  thus, it is concluded that the pip501 tra operon is negatively autoregulated at the transcriptional level by the conjugative dna relaxase traa.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

AB  == the in vitro activity of abt773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens  and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. abt773 was active (mic-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were also inhibited (mic-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to abt773 with the exception of vana mutants. e. faecium showed poor susceptibility  to abt773. the activity of the new ketolide against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. abt773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == the world health organization's external quality assurance system proficiency testing program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using nccls methods.
AB  == a total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the nccls testing procedures participated in the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eqas-ast) from january 1998 through march 2001. laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) in atlanta, ga. the results were compared to the results generated at the cdc with the nccls broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. although there were few testing errors with salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136  (91%) of 150 laboratories. in addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for staphylococcus  saprophyticus. for a vanb-containing enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference mic or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. of the laboratories that tested streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. while 110 laboratories (73%) tested the s. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no nccls interpretive criteria. ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an mic method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. the positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the eqas program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. the 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

AB  == the complete 50,237-bp dna sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis re25 was determined. the plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23s rna methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pip501 from streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pip501. genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin  acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in tn5405 from staphylococcus  aureus and in pjh1 from e. faecalis. one interrupted and five complete is elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pre25 was transferred by conjugation to e. faecalis, listeria innocua, and lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pip501. it is concluded that pre25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == identification of enterococcus, streptococcus, and staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  == a new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)h  mrs) with multivariate statistical analysis. this resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and the streptococcus milleri group. duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)h mrs. a total of 312 cultures were examined. an optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability  classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.

TI  == production, purification and some properties of bac201, a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance produced by staphylococcus aureus ab201.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus ab201, a clinical isolate from wound pus, produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance termed as bac201, that was inhibitory to streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, neisseria meningitidis and a number of staphylococcal species. it was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration (biosil-sec-125), and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (vydac c4). the native  bac201 was sized at approximately 170-kda as determined by gf hplc. fraction-i (native bac201), having antibacterial activity was also examined by transmission  electron microscopy and appeared as globular structure showing resemblance with phage-like objects. the purification of bac201 resulted in 466-fold increase in specific activity and recovery of 0.94% of total antibacterial activity. the purified bac201 migrated as single band on sds-page with an estimated molecular mass of about 41-kda. bac201 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat and organic solvents, and active over a wide range of ph (2.5-10). the amino acid composition revealed a general resemblance with other reported high molecular mass bacteriocins and predominance of glycine (39%), proline (13%) and  alanine (8%) residues. further results showed that bac201 has a bactericidal effect on sensitive cells which is not produced by either cell lysis or apparent  loss of membrane permeability.

AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == group b streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. to identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from a549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. these plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled gbs as a probe. gbs adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kda (p50) and 57 kda (p57). we concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (ck8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of ck8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with ck8 after separation by two-dimensional page; (iii) ck8 in solution bound to gbs, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from a549 lysates that bound to gbs in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled gbs bound to a549 lysate-derived ck8 that had been captured in anti-ck8-coated microtiter wells. ck8 bound to coh1-13, an acapsular mutant of coh1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. trypsin-treated gbs did not bind to ck8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of gbs. soluble ck8 bound to six of six gbs strains  tested. soluble ck8 also bound to staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. we hypothesize that adherence  of gbs to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.

TI  == an escherichia coli-enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector as a tool for the construction of a group b streptococcus heterologous mutant expressing the beta antigen (bac) of the c protein complex.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) represent a very important group of human pathogens. so far little is known about the mechanisms by which these bacteria can cause disease and the bacterial factors involved. one putative virulence factor is the  beta antigen of the c protein complex (bac), which can bind to the fc region of human iga. its binding function might represent an important virulence mechanism. however, the genetic manipulation of this group of bacteria, necessary to prove involvement of bacterial factors in pathogenesis, is still in its infancy. we therefore tested the pam401 vector system for its suitability in the construction of a heterologous expression mutant using the bac protein as a model antigen. the bac gene, including its own promoter, was cloned into the escherichia coli-enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector pam401 and was stably maintained extrachromosomally in the bac-deficient gbs strain 335. expression of bac was assessed by extracting the protein from transformed 335(ppjtu1) cells, negative controls (335 wild-type, 335(pam401)) and other bac-expressing gbs strains (a909, la239). blots of the extracted proteins probed with iga, polyclonal sera and a monoclonal antibody raised against bac clearly revealed expression of the 130-kda protein in the transformed gbs 335(ppjtu1) cells. the correct processing and surface anchoring of the expressed bac was demonstrated by binding of (125)i-labelled iga to whole cells. strain 335(ppjtu1) bound 12 times as much iga compared to the parental strain la239 and the gbs 335 negative controls, and a total of 25% compared to the high-level-expressing strain a909. our studies show  that the pam401 shuttle vector can be used for stable heterologous expression of  surface proteins in gbs. our strategy is also of major importance for the complementation of deletion mutants in gbs and other gram-positive human pathogens to fulfill koch's postulates. the bac mutant constructed in this study, 335(ppjtu1), can be used in animal models to assess the importance of bac in gbs  pathogenesis.

TI  == characterization of enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase and use in identifying streptococcus agalactiae secreted proteins.
AB  == we have identified and characterized an enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase (ap, encoded by phoz). the predicted gene product shows homology with alkaline phosphatases from a variety of species; it has especially high similarity with two alkaline phosphatases from bacillus subtilis. expression of phoz in escherichia coli, e. faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), or streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) produces a blue-colony phenotype on plates containing a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (xp or bcip). two tests were made to determine if the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the enzyme's subcellular location. first, elimination of the signal sequence reduced ap activity to 3% of the wild-type activity (or less) in three species of gram-positive bacteria. restoration of export, using the signal sequence from c5a peptidase, restored ap activity to at least 50% of that of the wild type. second, we engineered two chimeric proteins in which ap was fused to either a periplasmic domain or a cytoplasmic domain of lactose permease (a membrane protein). in e. coli, the periplasmic fusion had 17-fold-higher ap activity than the cytoplasmic  fusion. we concluded that ap activity is export dependent. the signal sequence deletion mutant, phozdeltass, was used to identify random genomic fragments from  gbs that encode exported proteins or integral membrane proteins. included in this set of fragments were genes that exhibited homology with the rib protein (a cell  wall protein from gbs) or with dppb (an integral membrane protein from gas). ap acts as a reporter enzyme in gbs, gas, and e. faecalis and is expected to be useful in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == we report the identification of a new cell wall-associated protein of enterococcus faecalis. studies on the distribution of the gene encoding this novel surface protein, esp, reveal a significant (p < 0.001) enrichment in infection-derived e. faecalis isolates. interestingly, the esp gene was not identified in any of 34 clinical e. faecium isolates or in 4 other less pathogenic enterococcal species tested. analysis of the structural gene among various e. faecalis isolates reveals the existence of alternate forms of expression of the esp protein. the deduced primary structure of the esp protein from strain mmh594, inferred to be 1,873 amino acids (aa) with a predicted mass of approximately 202 kda, reveals a core region consisting of repeat units that make up 50% of the protein. esp bears global organizational similarity to the rib and c alpha proteins of group b streptococci. identity among esp, rib, and c alpha proteins is strikingly localized to a stretch of 13 aa within repeats of similar length. the high degree of conservation of this 13-residue sequence suggests that it plays an important role in the natural selection for this trait  among infection-derived e. faecalis and group b streptococcal isolates.

TI  == blue/white screening of recombinant plasmids in gram-positive bacteria by interruption of alkaline phosphatase gene (phoz) expression.
AB  == the process of screening bacterial transformants for recombinant plasmids is made more rapid and simple by the use of vectors with visually detectable reporter genes. in such systems, an alteration in colony phenotype occurs when a vector-borne indicator gene is interrupted with exogenous dna. although the lacz  system has been used extensively for this purpose in e. coli, analogous systems for use in gram-positive bacteria remain uncommon. we have developed a gram-positive cloning vector that utilizes the interruption of an alkaline phosphatase gene, phoz, to identify recombinant plasmids. to facilitate introduction of foreign dna, a multiple cloning site (mcs) was inserted distal to the region coding for the putative signal peptide of phoz. alkaline phosphatase expressed from the derivative phoz gene (phozmcs) retained activity similar to that of the native protein. the phozmcs was transferred to pjs3, a well-characterized, high-copy number, and broad-host-range plasmid, to produce pdc123. in pdc123, phozmcs was transcriptionally linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene under the control of the constitutively expressed tetm and cat promoters that drive cat expression in pjs3. s. agalactiae (group b  streptococci, gbs), e. faecalis, s. pyogenes, s. gordonii, and e. coli containing pdc123 displayed a blue colonial phenotype on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (x-p), which was readily distinguished from  that of colonies containing the parent plasmid pjs3. introduction of foreign dna  into the mcs of phozmcs produced a white colonial phenotype in e. coli and gbs on agar containing x-p and allowed discrimination between transformants containing recombinant plasmids versus those maintaining self-annealed or uncut vector. we have used pdc123 to subclone the cpse gene from the plasmid pcer111, which carries a 9.0-kb fragment of the gbs capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. the plasmid pdc123 containing cpse was isolated by direct electroporation into gbs strain a909 with selection of transformants containing recombinant plasmids achieved by 'blue/white' screening, without the use of an intermediate host. this new cloning vector should improve the efficiency of performing recombinant dna experiments in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == use of the lactococcal nisa promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  == we characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisa promoter in strains of the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis. nisa promoter activity was dependent on the proteins nisr and nisk, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the  extracellular inducer nisin. the nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. significant induction of the nisa promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is  inhibited. the efficiency of the nisa promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the spac, xyla, and laca promoters in b. subtilis and in s. pyogenes. because  nisa promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.

TI  == comparison of nna agar culture and selective broth culture for detection of group b streptococcal colonization in women.
AB  == in 1996, the centers for disease control and prevention recommended the use of a  selective broth culture for the improved detection of genital tract or anorectal  carriage of group b streptococci (gbs) in pregnant women. in order to verify this recommendation in our laboratory, we compared the sensitivity of todd-hewitt medium with gentamicin and nalidixic acid (sbm) with our current method of direct plating on blood agar medium containing neomycin and nalidixic acid (nna). five hundred consecutive cervicovaginal and anorectal specimens submitted for gbs culture were included in the study. swabs were plated onto nna and the swabs were immersed in sbm, followed by overnight incubation at 35 degrees c. on the following day, the nna plates were examined for colonies typical of gbs and the organisms were identified by the camp test or by latex agglutination. sbm cultures were subcultured onto blood agar and cna agar plates, and the plates were reincubated for 24 h. negative specimens from either medium were incubated for an additional 24 h and were examined again before finalization of the results. gbs were recovered from 78 specimens by both methods; from sbm only for  17 specimens (sensitivity, 86%) and from nna only for 16 specimens (sensitivity,  85%). a moderate to heavy growth of enterococcus faecalis was observed on plates  containing nna-positive, sbm-negative specimens. competitive growth studies suggested that e. faecalis suppressed the growth potential of gbs in sbm. our study suggests that direct plating on nna, as a single method, is equivalent in sensitivity to sbm for the recovery of gbs, and the results are often available 24 h sooner. however, it appears that both direct plating and selective broth amplification techniques are required for the maximum level of identification of  colonization with gbs in pregnant women.

TI  == a new ketolide, hmr 3004, active against streptococci inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  == hmr 3004 is a new hydrazono ketolide characterized by a 3-keto function instead of the cladinose moiety. the effect of this antimicrobial agent on inducible and  constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mlsb) resistance was tested in a lacz reporter system under control of several ermam-like attenuator variants. for one constitutively resistant streptococcus agalactiae strain, three inducibly resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, and one inducibly resistant enterococcus faecalis strain, the attenuators fused with lacz were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pjim2246 and the plasmid was introduced into staphylococcus aureus rn4220. for the wild-type attenuators, hmr 3004 was a very weak inducer, unlike its cladinose counterpart ru 6652 and erythromycin. as expected, for the fusion originating from the constitutively resistant s. agalactiae strain, the level of uninduced beta-galactosidase synthesis was high. for one s. pneumoniae attenuator, mutations in the 3' end of the attenuator that weakened the stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon for ermam methylase could explain the high level of uninduced beta-galactosidase produced.  for streptococci, the activity of hmr 3004 correlated with the basal level of beta-galactosidase synthesized. the weak inducer activity of hmr 3004 explained its activity against inducibly mlsb-resistant s. pneumoniae but did not correlate with the moderate activity of the antibiotic against inducibly resistant e. faecalis.

TI  == attachment of group b streptococci to macrophages is mediated by a 21-kda protein.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is able to bind to human macrophages in vitro in the  absence of exogenous opsonins. the exact mechanisms that mediate this attachment  are unclear. this study was undertaken to determine what protein adhesins are present on the surface of gbs that mediate attachment to macrophages. we have identified a 21-kda protein from the envelope of gbs type iii that directly binds to macrophages as determined by western blot analysis. antiserum against this protein was able to inhibit binding of gbs to macrophages by greater than 80% as  measured by flow cytometry. antiserum against the 21-kda protein cross-reacted with 21-kda proteins from gbs type ib, type ii, type iii (coh31 and mr732) and type iv, as well as staphyloccus epidermidis, but not gbs type ia, listeria monocytogenes or enterococcus faecalis. this protein may be important in mediating the attachment of gbs to macrophages in an opsonin-poor environment.

TI  == import and metabolism of glutathione by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == glutathione (gamma-glucysgly, gsh) is not found in most gram-positive bacteria, but some appear to synthesize it and others, including streptococcus mutans atcc  33402, import it from their growth medium. import of oxidized glutathione (gssg)  by s. mutans 33402 in 7h9 medium was shown to require glucose and to occur with an apparent km of 18+/-5 microm. gssg, gsh, s-methylglutathione, and homocysteine-glutathione mixed disulfide (hcyssg) were imported at comparable rates (measured by depletion of substrate in the medium), as was the disulfide of gamma-glucys. in contrast, the disulfide of cysgly was not taken up at a measurable rate, indicating that the gamma-glu residue is important for efficient transport. during incubation with gssg, little gssg was detected in cells but gsh and gamma-glucys accumulated during the first 30 min and then declined. no significant intracellular accumulation of cys or sulfide was found. transient intracellular accumulation of d/l-homocysteine, as well as gsh and gamma-glucys,  was observed during import of hcyssg. although substantial levels of gsh were found in cells when s. mutans was grown on media containing glutathione, such gsh accumulation had no effect on the growth rate. however, the presence of cellular  gsh did protect against growth inhibition by the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide. import of glutathione by s. mutans atcc 25175, which like strain 33402 does not synthesize glutathione, occurred at a rate comparable to that of strain 33402, but three species which appear to synthesize glutathione (s. agalactiae atcc 12927, s. pyogenes atcc 8668, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) imported glutathione at negligible or markedly lower rates.

TI  == a broad-host-range mobilizable shuttle vector for the construction of transcriptional fusions to beta-galactosidase in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a low-copy-number vector designated ptcv-lac has been constructed to provide a convenient system to analyze regulatory elements in gram-positive bacteria. the main components of this vector are: (i) the origins of replication of pacyc184 and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pam beta 1, (ii) erythromycin- and kanamycin-resistance-encoding genes for selection in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, (iii) the transfer origin of the incp plasmid rk2, and (iv) a promoterless beta-galactosidase-encoding lacz gene with a gram-positive ribosome binding site. this 12 kb plasmid is present in gram-positive hosts in three to five copies per chromosome equivalent and contains three unique cloning  sites (ecori, smai, bamhi) for cloning of dna inserts upstream of the lacz gene.  plasmid ptcv-lac and derivatives carrying different promoter fragments have been  transferred by conjugation from an escherichia coli incp mobilizing donor strain  to bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae. these plasmids were structurally stable in these hosts  and the corresponding promoter activities, quantitated by the determination of the beta-galactosidase specific activities, were found to cover at least a 100-fold range in beta-galactosidase values. these results indicate that ptcv-lac should be useful for analysis of gene regulation in a wide range of gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

AB  == streptococcus agalactiae b128 is the only highly gentamicin-resistant group b streptococcal (gbs) strain described so far. this strain carries a chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon, designated tn3706, which is similar, if not identical, to the tn4001 and tn5281 transpons detected in staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. transposition of tn3706 occurred onto the gbs plasmid pip501 in two different loci of its 7.5-kb avaii fragment carrying the genes for chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance. molecular analysis of pip501 derivatives showed that tn3706 is composed of a central fragment containing the aac6'-aph2" gene; this fragment is flanked by two tandemly repeated copies of is256 at the 5' extremity of the resistance gene and  a single inverted copy of is256 at its 3' extremity. the two tandemly repeated copies of is256 were separated by a 6-bp segment identical to that found, in the  same orientation, in the is256-aac6'-aph2" junction. the hybrid replicons pip501::tn3706 were found to be structurally unstable following conjugative transfer between gbs strains. numerous individual copies of is256 were detected in b128, but this insertion sequence was not found in the 11 wild-type, gentamicin-susceptible gbs strains studied.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == the closely related ermb-ermam genes from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis (pam beta 1), and streptococcus agalactiae (pip501) are flanked by variants of a directly repeated sequence.
AB  == the clostridium perfringens macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance gene, ermbp, was sequenced and shown to be identical to the ermb-ermam gene from  the promiscuous enterococcus faecalis plasmid pam beta 1 and to have at least 98% nucleotide sequence identity to other ermb-ermam genes. flanking the ermbp structural gene were almost identical directly repeated 1,341-bp sequences (dr1 and dr2). these repeats potentially encoded a 298 (or 284)-amino-acid protein that had sequence similarity to chromosomal and plasmid partitioning proteins. the pam beta 1 and streptococcus agalactiae (pip501) erm determinants appeared to have dr2 but had similar internal 973- or 956-bp deletions in dr1, respectively.  some of the other ermb-ermam class determinants had small portions of dr1, but none had complete copies. it is postulated that the c. perfringens ermbp determinant was derived from an enterococcal or streptococcal determinant that had complete copies of both dr1 and dr2.

TI  == characterization and heterologous expression of the tetl gene and identification  of iso-iss1 elements from enterococcus faecalis plasmid pjh1.
AB  == the tetracycline-resistance (tcr) determinant of the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pjh1 has been identified and located on a 2.2-kb rsai-ecori fragment. the fragment was cloned in escherichia coli, and specified tcr in this host. the nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame (orf) of 1374 bp, designated tetl. the nt sequence of tetl from pjh1 was identical to that of the tetl present on pls1 from streptococcus agalactiae. upstream of the pjh1 tetl, part of another orf was found that, except for two single-nt substitutions, was identical to an iso-iss1 element from lactococcus lactis. hybridization studies indicated the presence of several iss1-like elements in plasmid pjh1, but not on the en. faecalis chromosome. to study its usefulness as a marker in gram+ organisms, the pjh1 tetl was cloned on  the broad-host-range plasmid pnz124, resulting in pnz280, that was found to give  resistance to 40 micrograms tc/ml in lc. lactis and bacillus subtilis.

TI  == development of a direct viable count procedure for some gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the direct viable count (dvc) is a procedure for enumerating viable-nonculturable cells. it should be noted, however, that bacteria demonstrating the viable but nonculturable phase have to date included only gram-negative species, mainly because the dvc procedure does not lend itself to the analysis of gram-positive bacteria since the dvc procedure is dependent on the bacterium being sensitive to nalidixic acid. the authors report here concerning studies on an analogous procedure for the direct enumeration of viable-nonculturable gram-positive bacteria. to facilitate a differential dvc for gram-positive bacteria, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin or isopropyl cinodine were substituted for nalidixic acid. these antibiotics were chosen because, like nalidixic acid, they  are dna gyrase inhibitors. the concentrations used for each antibiotic were 1000  micrograms ml-1, 100 micrograms ml-1. pure cultures of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and bacillus subtilis were obtained from the culture collection at the university of  wyoming and a faecal streptococcus was isolated from the laramie wastewater treatment plant. an antibiotic and optimal concentration thereof was found which  gave enlarged cells for all the organisms except the faecal streptococcus isolated from the wastewater plant for which no enlarged cells were ever seen. the antibiotic and concentration thereof which gave the optimal percent enlarged  cells in the dvc procedure varied between organisms.

TI  == heterogeneric conjugal transfer of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pip964 (inchlyi) of enterococcus faecalis in the apparent absence of pheromone induction.
AB  == erythromycin-resistant derivatives of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pip964 from enterococcus faecalis were constructed to study its host range. this was done by inserting the integrative vector pat112 and the related replicon ptcr1 harboring orir of the broad host range plasmid pam beta 1 into the hemolysin-bacteriocin operon of pip964, to give ptcr2 and ptcr3, respectively. plasmid ptcr2 was transferred by filter matings from e. faecalis to enterococcus  faecium and listeria monocytogenes at frequencies of 2 x 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-7) per donor, respectively, in the apparent absence of pheromone induction and cellular aggregation. in these hosts, ptcr2 remained intact as a self-replicating element and maintained its transfer capabilities. plasmid ptcr3, but not ptcr2, was transferred at similar frequencies from e. faecalis to lactococcus lactis and streptococcus agalactiae. thus, the transfer system of pip964 possesses a broader host-range than its replication system.

TI  == the promiscuous plasmids pip501 and pam beta 1 from gram-positive bacteria encode complementary resolution functions.
AB  == pip501 and pam beta 1 are promiscuous plasmids from gram-positive bacteria which  carry structurally and genetically related replication functions (l. janniere, a. gruss and s.d. ehrlich, 1993, in "bacillus subtilis and other gram-positive bacteria: biochemistry, physiology, and molecular genetics (a.l. sonenshein, j.a. hoch, and r. losick, eds.), pp. 625-644). we report here the sequence of a approximately 1 kb region located downstream of the pip501 minimal replicon. this region is 82% homologous to the corresponding region of pam beta 1 and encodes a  resolution system which complements that of pam beta 1. additionally, we present  evidence that the structural similarity between the two plasmids extends for further approximately 2 kb, through a region which may encode a topoisomerase protein in pam beta 1.

TI  == streptococcal update. a microbiology perspective.
AB  == the streptococci remain important human pathogens despite it being nearly 60 years since sulphonamides were introduced. rheumatic fever and post glomerulonephritis are common diseases in the aboriginal community, and a new invasive disease, toxic shock-like syndrome, is also caused by group a streptococcus. group b, first described over 50 years ago in obstetric wards remains the primary neonatal pathogen despite attempts to eliminate this organism from the genital tract of the carrier mother. a major concern in paediatrics is the relatively poor response to the current pneumococcal vaccines. australian researchers are playing a major role in developing a new vaccine with high antigenicity against all of the 100 odd serotypes of s pneumoniae. the oral streptococci are now recognised as important opportunistic pathogens and the pathogenesis is well defined. disturbing reports from different geographical regions alert us to the antibiotic resistance in some of the streptococci once thought of as sensitive bacteria, for example, group a has shown resistance to erythromycin, the pneumococcus to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics and the  aminoglycosides have been ineffective against the enterococci due to plasmid-borne genes.

TI  == the microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  == basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of streptococcaceae are given. identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, lancefield group c and g streptococci, s. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (lancefield grouping). rapid antigen tests for the detection of group a and b streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. the reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. the elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group a and b streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and  molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. recently employed examples include the  m protein gene typing of group a streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of pcr assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial dna in association with dna fragment separation by conventional or pfge have been applied successfully to several species of streptococcaceae (e.g., s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae). enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe  underlying disease. molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. e. faecalis and e. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal  species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. the definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. the increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. all enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in e. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == use of modified rambach agar to differentiate streptococcus uberis from other mastitis streptococci.
AB  == the medium of rambach was modified to permit differentiation of mastitis streptococci. a total of 377 streptococci isolated from bovine imi was used in the study. of the 159 strains identified as streptococcus uberis, 151 strains (94.9%) were beta-galactosidase-positive and yielded blue colonies on modified rambach agar. in comparison, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, enterococcus saccharolyticus, or enterococcus faecalis strains were negative for propylene glycol utilization (red colonies) or beta-galactosidase production; all strains yielded colorless colonies on modified rambach agar. however, 5 of 35 (14.3%) streptococcus equinus strains were also positive for beta-galactosidase. results indicate that modified rambach agar is a convenient medium for the differentiation of the strep. uberis from the other mastitis streptococci. furthermore, modified rambach agar could be easily incorporated as  a screening medium for strep. uberis in mastitis bacteriology laboratories.

TI  == biochemical and genetic analysis of the unidirectional theta replication of the s. agalactiae plasmid pip501.
AB  == pip501 is a broad-host-range plasmid originating from streptococcus agalactiae. in this report we show that (i) it replicates by a theta mechanism initiating at  the 3' end of the gene encoding the replication protein repr and progressing in the direction of transcription of this gene; (ii) its replication origin lies within or a few nucleotides downstream from orf r and not upstream from it as suggested in the literature (brantl et al. (1990) nucleic acids res. 18, 4783-4789); (iii) the repr protein positively regulates pip501 copy number; and (vi) the main function ensured by the sequences located upstream from orf r is to express this orf. since the replication properties of pip501 are indistinguishable from those of the highly related enterococcus faecalis plasmid  pam beta 1, we conclude that these elements form the first family of theta replicating plasmids in gram-positive bacteria. based on sequence similarities, we extend this family to the s. pyogenes plasmid psm19035 and to 12 other plasmids isolated from streptococci or enterococci.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16s ribosomal dna of streptococcus and enterococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  == twelve bacterial species including streptococcus uberis, s. parauberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, s. bovis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. saccharolyticus, enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. avium, and aerococcus viridans were examined for their 16s ribosomal dna fingerprint patterns. oligonucleotide primers complementary to 16s rrna genes were used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction 16s ribosomal gene fragments from genomic dnas. the molecular sizes of the amplified 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) fragments from the 12 species examined ranged from 1,400 to 1,500 bp. restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16s rdna was performed with 11 different restriction endonucleases. all 12 species examined could be differentiated on the basis of characteristic 16s rdna fingerprint patterns by using the restriction endonucleases hhai, rsai, and mspi. a scheme for the differentiation of the 12 species is presented. eleven isolates representing 11 species were obtained from  cows with intramammary infections and were examined by 16s rdna fingerprinting. all 11 species isolated from cows were differentiated by using hhai, rsai, and mspi restriction endonucleases. the results of this study demonstrate the potential application of 16s rdna fingerprinting for the identification and differentiation of bacterial species.

TI  == preferential activation of peripheral blood v gamma 9+ gamma/delta t cells by group a, b and c but not group d or f streptococci.
AB  == previous studies have established that inactivated mycobacteria are potent and selective activators of v gamma 9+/v delta 2+ human gamma/delta t cells. here we  have analysed the proliferative response of human gamma/delta t cells to five serologically distinct groups of streptococci. while heat-inactivated streptococci of all five serogroups tested (a, b, c, d and f) induced a strong proliferative response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), only groups  a, b and c elicited a selective activation of v gamma 9+ gamma/delta t cells in 10 (serogroup b) or 11 (serogroups a and c) of 11 tested healthy individuals. in  striking contrast, groups d and f streptococci failed to activate gamma/delta t cells in nine of 11 donors and induced only a weak gamma/delta t cell response in two additional individuals. depletion of v gamma 9+ t cells before culture completely eliminated all gamma/delta t cell responses to streptococci. these data indicate that groups a, b and c (but not d or f) streptococci can be included in the growing list of selective ligands for v gamma 9+/v delta 2+ human gamma/delta t cells.

TI  == in-vitro activity of rp 59500, a semisynthetic streptogramin, against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of rp 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. the two compounds displayed similar activities. the mic90s of rp 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/l in 114 strains of staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. rp 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with mic90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes  (n = 20), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (mic90, 8 mg/l). in view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, rp  59500 merits further investigation.

TI  == nosocomial bacterial infections in very low birth weight infants.
AB  == the occurrence of congenital and nosocomial bacterial septicaemia has been documented by identifying the number of positive blood cultures by reviewing the  laboratory and clinical records of 394 very low birth weight infants who were consecutively admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit over a 40-month period.  the incidence of congenital septicaemia was 6% and of nosocomial septicaemia 17%. the commonest causes of congenital infection were streptococcus agalactiae staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis (each in 18% of cases). the  commonest cause of nosocomial infection was s. epidermidis (51% of cases), except in infants of birth weight less than 750 g. risk factors for nosocomial infection were extremely low birth weight, very preterm birth and prolonged ventilation. nosocomial infection was associated with significantly lengthened hospital admission.

TI  == identical genes confer high-level resistance to gentamicin upon enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == the structural gene coding for the bifunctional aminoglycoside-modifying 6'-acetyltransferase-2''-phosphotransferase (6'aac-2''aph) enzyme was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using template dna of clinical isolates of enterococci (both enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) and the single high-level gentamicin-resistant streptococcus agalactiae  strain identified thus far. the results of the present study demonstrated that the genes encoding this antibiotic resistance trait are highly homologous in these species. in dot blot hybridization assays using nonradioactively labeled oligonucleotide probes, strains with and without high-level gentamicin resistance could be discerned unequivocally. the gene segment encoding 6'-acetylating activity and the gene segment encoding 2''-phosphorylating activity were simultaneously present in all isolates exhibiting high-level gentamicin resistance.

TI  == in vitro activity of the new glycopeptide decaplanin.
AB  == the activity of decaplanin, a new glycopeptide, was compared to that of vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin. decaplanin was two- to four-fold less active than vancomycin, telcoplanin and daptomycin against staphylococcus aureus  and staphylococcus epidermidis, with an mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml for methicillin-susceptible and 4 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant isolates. decaplanin had activity similar to that of vancomycin against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, group c and g streptococci, with an mic90 of  0.12 micrograms/ml. it was less active than the other agents against the viridans group streptococci (mic90 4 micrograms/ml). the activity of decaplanin against enterococci (mic90 4 micrograms/ml) was similar to that of vancomycin. clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, peptostreptococci and peptococci by 0.25 microgram/ml. decaplanin was active from ph 5.5 to 7.5. inoculum size had a minimal effect on mics, and increased concentrations of ca2+  and mg2+ and 50% serum did not alter mics or mbcs.

TI  == bacteriological nasal flora in newborns indicating health and/or development of infection.
AB  == during delivery, a fetus otherwise sterile during the intrauterine life, comes in contact with bacterial flora of the mother's birth canal, and then also with the  ward personnel's skin and respiratory system flora. due to the absence of competitive bacteriological flora, the nasal cavity is gradually colonized by microorganisms, especially those with a capacity of adhesion to epithelial cells  of respiratory nasal mucosa. bacteriological flora of the newborn's nasal flora was observed on days 1 and 3 postpartum, in an attempt to determine whether a finding of pathogenic bacterial flora in newborn's nasal mucosa indicates a localized infection only or points to the possible development of generalized infection. bacteriological nasal flora was monitored in infants born by spontaneous delivery and in those born by cesarean section. in mothers of infants born by spontaneous delivery, bacteriological flora from the cervix uteri was investigated. results of the study performed by usual methods revealed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus to prevail in the pathogenic flora. gram-negative microorganisms were found to be good indicators of local infection  of newborn's nasal mucosa, regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms.

TI  == in vitro activity of sparfloxacin (ci-978, at-4140, and pd 131501). a quinolone with high activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == sparfloxacin (ci-978, at-4140 and pd 131501) is a new antimicrobial agent of the  piperazinyl quinolone class. relative to other quinolones, it is a potent antistaphylococcal and antistreptococcal drug in vitro: the microbroth 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) (in microgram/ml) was 0.25 vs 26 methicillin-resistant and -sensitive coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci and 20 streptococcus pneumoniae; 0.5 vs 20 strains each of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and enterococcus faecalis. the data indicate sparfloxacin to be generally superior to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, cefazolin, doxycycline, amikacin, and vancomycin against these gram-positive bacterial groups. additional mic90s were determined for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae (less than or equal to 0.03); enterobacteriaceae (0.5); and listeria monocytogenes (1). activity was generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic-anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium cholate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or  decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing ph (ph less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine. naturally occurring resistant mutants occurred at frequencies of 10(-8) or lower.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from belgium.
AB  == to study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in belgium. against enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. ceftibuten mic50s were less  than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). this level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to  8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. none of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. the mic90s of ceftibuten for strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml,  respectively. strains of streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. strains of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.

TI  == application of the polymerase chain reaction to study the m protein(-like) gene family in beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  == evaluation of homologous regions of published m protein (emm) gene sequences from group a streptococci (gas; streptococcus pyogenes) was used to design three primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and three oligonucleotide probe  sequences internal to the amplified products. one set of primers and corresponding probe should detect and lead to amplification of emm(-like) genes of virtually every type ("all m"), another ("sor-m") should only amplify emm(-like) genes from gas negative for serum opacity reaction (sor) and the third ("sor+ m") should expand only emm(-like) genes from sor+ gas. using the "allm" primer pair for pcr on the genomic dna from gas of 29 different m types as well as from a group c and a group g streptococcal isolate, dna fragments within the expected size range were amplified in every assay. all pcr products reacted with  the "allm" probe. related sequences were not detected in genomic dna of an s. agalactiae and an enterococcus faecalis isolate. applying the "sor-m" and "sor+m" primers to identical assays led to mutually exclusive amplification products. the "sor-m" and "sor+m" probes hybridized only to their corresponding products. exceptions to this exclusivity were the sor- gas of m types 3, 8, 27, 34, 42, 67, and 69, which consistently reacted only with the "sor+m" primer/probe set. analysis of sequence data from the amplified emm(-like) 2, 3, 18, and 19 genes revealed interesting specific features such as conserved gaps in the c-terminal sequence regions from sor+ and the exceptional sor- gas strains. these data indicate the existence of a subgroup of strains among sor- gas and may advance our understanding of phylogenetic relationship between different serotypes of gas.

AB  == thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (uti) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower uti) or a 14 day (upper uti) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper uti. overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. the infecting organisms were: escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), citrobacter freundii (three), klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter agglomerans, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis (one of each). all of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. the effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. the cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively.  there were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. in the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. one of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. in this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic uti.

TI  == transferable plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance in listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == a strain of listeria monocytogenes, isolated from a patient with meningoencephalitis, was resistant to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. the genes conferring resistance to these antibiotics were carried by a 37-kb plasmid, pip811, that was self-transferable to other l monocytogenes cells, to enterococci-streptococci, and to staphylococcus aureus. the efficacy of transfer and the stability of pip811 were  higher in enterococci-streptococci than in the other gram-positive bacteria. as indicated by nucleic acid hybridisation, the genes in pip811 conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and streptomycin were closely related to plasmid-borne determinants that are common in enterococci-streptococci. plasmid pip811 shared extensive sequence homology with  pam beta 1, the prototype broad host range resistance plasmid in these two groups of gram-positive cocci. these results suggest that emergence of multiple antibiotic resistance in listeria spp is due to acquisition of a replicon originating in enterococci-streptococci. the dissemination of resistance to other strains of l monocytogenes is likely.

TI  == high-level chromosomal gentamicin resistance in streptococcus agalactiae (group b).
AB  == this is the first report of high-level gentamicin resistance in a group b streptococcus. strain b128 of serotype ii was isolated from an infected leg wound in 1987. b128 was resistant to high levels of gentamicin as well as of all other  available aminoglycosides and was also resistant to tetracyclines. no bactericidal synergism was found between ampicillin or vancomycin and any of these aminoglycosides. gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline resistance determinants transferred by conjugation into a plasmid-free group b streptococcus recipient at a frequency of 10(-8) to 10(-9) transconjugants per donor cell. no transconjugants were detected when streptococci of groups a, c, and g, streptococcus sanguis, or enterococcus faecalis was used as a recipient. no plasmids were detected in b128 or in any of the four transconjugants tested. by dna-dna hybridization, homology was detected between gene aac6/aph2, of e. faecalis origin, and a 2.4-kilobase hindiii chromosomal fragment of b128; homology to the genes aph3 and aade, of e. faecalis origin, was found with hindiii chromosomal fragments of the same size (3.0 kilobases). strains like b128, which potentially can be responsible for severe neonatal infections, are of great clinical concern, since there are to date no antibiotic combinations exhibiting bactericidal synergism against them.

AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension during three types of gram-positive bacteremia in piglets.
AB  == thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in animals during intravenous infusion of group b streptococcus (gbs), a gram-positive neonatal pathogen. we postulated that other gram-positive neonatal pathogens, such as streptococcus fecalis (ent) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi) would also induce increased thromboxane synthesis and pulmonary hypertension when infused into piglets. we observed similar hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities during stepwise increases in the dose of gbs, ent, and s. epi (n = 3, 4, and 4 piglets receiving each bacteria, respectively). pulmonary vascular resistance increased significantly in the absence of acidosis or reduced arterial or mixed venous po2 at a dose of 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for ent and s. epi. in 14 additional piglets, pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly after 60 min of intravenous infusion of 4 +/- 1 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for each organism (p less than 0.05, gbs: 11.7 +/- 1.8 to 75.6 +/- 18.4 mm hg/liter/min, ent: 12.7 +/- 1.7 to 64.9 +/- 10.6 mm hg/liter/min, s. epi: 10.5 +/- 0.8 to 56.9 +/- 6.0 mm hg/liter/min), and blood thromboxane b2 levels increased (p less than 0.05, gbs:  30 +/- 10 to 1830 +/- 330 pg/ml, ent: 20 +/- 7 to 1110 +/- 300 pg/ml, s. epi: 31  +/- 9 to 1260 +/- 350 pg/ml). this dose of each bacteria caused a similar degree  of mild arterial hypoxemia (57-66 mm hg). the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazmegrel, completely reversed pulmonary hypertension, reduced txb2 levels to near baseline values, and partially reversed arterial hypoxemia despite ongoing bacterial infusion. we conclude that thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in piglets during infusion of different gram-positive neonatal pathogens.

TI  == structural studies of a teichoic acid from streptococcus agalactiae type iii.
AB  == an unusual type of teichoic acid has been isolated from streptococcus agalactiae  type iii. it has the same backbone as the lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus faecalis, but is devoid of fatty acid residues, a phosphatidyl group, and substituents in the poly(glycerol phosphate) side-chain. the following structure, with n approximately 20, was determined mainly with the aid of n.m.r. spectroscopy.

TI  == dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  == plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups a, b, and g, ten from enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the  chloramphenicol resistance gene of pip501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group b streptococcus. the 6.3-kb hindiii fragment of pip501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pbr322. a 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in dna-dna hybridization experiments. sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. the absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group b streptococcus, as well as three isolated from e. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants  in the streptococci and in the enterococci.

TI  == modulation of complement fixation and the phlogistic capacity of group a, b, and  d streptococci by human lysozyme acting on their cell walls.
AB  == streptococci and streptococcal cell wall fragments induce arthritis in rats, with the severity and duration depending on the capacity of the cells or cell fragments to resist degradation by tissue enzymes. their phlogogenic effects are  apparently related to their ability to activate the alternate complement pathway  (acp). the in vitro activation of the acp by lysozyme-treated cells and cell walls of group a, b, and d streptococci suggests that both rat and human lysozyme can modulate this activity, i.e., increasing it, decreasing it, or doing both in  that order. the effects of the lysozymes also correlated with the degree to which they can unmask the aminosugar-reducing groups detectable in a given amount of cell wall, which suggests that partial depolymerization of the cell wall is critical for acp activation. the effects of mutanolysin and c phage lysin on acp  activation were found to be correlated with their action on streptococcal cell walls. neuraminidase had relatively little effect on acp activation by most streptococcal strains tested. we conclude that the participation of tissue enzymes, including but not necessarily limited to lysozyme, is an important determinant for the clinical arthritis induced by group a, b, or d streptococci.  experimental arthritis induced in rats with whole (or disrupted) streptococci may depend both on the capacities of the cell walls to activate the acp and on the capacities of the host tissue enzymes to modulate this activation. great severity and long durations of the disease were determined by the capacity of the enzymes  to degrade cell wall antigens to a degree sufficient to ensure efficient activation of the acp without completely degrading the material so that it no longer activates complement. in this model, the limited resistance of group b peptidoglycan to lysozyme was a critical pathogenic factor.

TI  == structure of a conjugative element in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == we have cloned and mapped a 69-kilobase (kb) region of the chromosome of streptococcus pneumoniae dp1322, which carries the conjugative omega (cat-tet) insertion from s. pneumoniae bm6001. this element proved to be 65.5 kb in size. location of the junctions was facilitated by cloning a preferred target region from the wild-type strain rx1 recipient genome. this target site was preferred by both the bm6001 element and the cat-erm-tet element from streptococcus agalactiae b109. within the bm6001 element cat and tet were separated by 30 kb, and cat was  flanked by two copies of a sequence that was also present in the recipient strain rx1 dna. another sequence at least 2.4 kb in size was found inside the bm6001 element and at two places in the rx1 genome. its role is unknown. the ends of the bm6001 element appear to be the same as those of the b109 element, both as seen after transfer to s. pneumoniae and as mapped by others in pdp5 after transposition in streptococcus faecalis. we see no homology between the ends of the bm6001 element and find no evidence suggesting that it ever circularizes.

AB  == the comparative study of different protein bases has shown that the combined base containing animal blood hydrolysate (amino peptide) and acidic casein hydrolysate, moderately cleaved, in the proportion 1:1 is a good source of nitrogen and ensures the intensive growth of streptococci. as determined by the study of the physiological parameters and growth of streptococci, the presence of fodder yeast extract, glutamine, glucose and phosphates in media containing blood hydrolysate and casein hydrolysate has been found to render a stimulating effect  on the growth and multiplication of these organisms. the data thus obtained have  been used as the basis for developing the formula of a dried culture medium, capable of ensuring the growth of streptococci without blood or serum added and not inferior in its quality to todd-hewitt broth manufactured by oxoid ltd. (great britain) and difco laboratories (usa). the physico-chemical and physiological characteristics of the proposed medium have been determined. the use of the new dried culture medium in medical practice will make it possible to  improve the microbiological diagnosis of streptococcal infections.

TI  == [evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the atp-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  == bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in atp content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. the results obtained were as follows: the bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the atp-bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by cfu assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming  and more simple than other methods. using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. the serum suppressed the growth rate of e. coli, str.  fecalis, cbs, kleb. pneumoniae and staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. the anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional disc method. thus the sensitivity test  under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. these results suggest the usefulness of atp-bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

TI  == a new approach for presumptive identification of clinically important streptococci.
AB  == several tests, bacitracin, camp, pyroglutamic acid-b-naphthylamide test (pyr test), bile aesculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance and pigment production tests were evaluated for their reliability and speed in presumptive identification of streptococci. bacitracin correctly identified all of the group a streptococci but 5% of other beta haemolytic streptococci were misidentified as group a. the pyr reaction was just as sensitive but more specific for group a streptococci and the results were available within 2-3 h. the pyr reaction also effectively differentiated between enterococcal and non-enterococcal group d streptococci. both the salt tolerance test and the pyr reaction misidentified bile aesculin positive non-group d streptococci as non-enterococcal group d streptococci. pigment production by group b streptococci was more reliable than the camp test for identifying group b streptococci. the combination of pyr, bile aesculin and pigment production allowed rapid differentiation of several medically important groups of streptococci.

TI  == comparison of latex agglutination and immunofluorescence for direct lancefield grouping of streptococci from blood cultures.
AB  == simulated positive blood cultures with 84 known stock strains of streptococci were used to comparatively evaluate the direct identification of these organisms  by fluorescein-tagged antibody staining (immunofluorescence [if]) and latex agglutination (la). if was not evaluated for lancefield group d strains (a total  of 81 strains tested) and had 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. if was least sensitive for the identification of lancefield group f, in which three of seven strains showed no fluorescence with the group f reagent. since la was more convenient and revealed comparable sensitivities and specificities on 84 simulated cultures, we tested this procedure using an additional 29 fresh positive clinical blood cultures, for a total of 113 cultures tested by this technique. of 11 streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 9 reacted with the la group c  reagent, a problem not observed with if. however, all these strains were identified by a rapid modified bile solubility test. of the 12 streptococcus faecalis strains, 4 were falsely negative with the group d reagent, but all were  correctly identified by a rapid litmus milk reduction test. of 12 group a strains, 1 was not detected. of all 113 strains tested by la, eliminating s. faecalis and s. pneumoniae, the sensitivity and specificity were 97 and 98%, respectively. la was simple and reliable in the rapid identification of streptococci from blood cultures and appeared to be preferable to if. when la is  used, the group d reagent should not be used, and all samples reacting with the group c reagent should be tested by a modified rapid bile solubility test to exclude s. pneumoniae.

TI  == identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of streptococcus faecium atcc 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). pbps with similar properties are carried by strains of streptococcus durans, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae. the strains carrying the slow-reacting pbp demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was  several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from s. faecium atcc 9790. they all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting pbp produced. mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of s. durans, s.  faecalis, and s. faecium. all of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting pbp than that carried by the parent. finally, it was found that resistant s. faecium atcc 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all pbps except pbp 5. cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting pbp by 90%. this penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  == rat arthritis due to whole group b streptococci. clinical and histopathologic features compared with groups a and d.
AB  == heat-killed streptococci of groups a, b, and d injected intraperitoneally into sprague-dawley rats induced arthritis. the histopathologic features of the arthritis were those of erosive synovitis. early acute lesions were associated with deposits of streptococcal antigens. the serogroups and the physical state of the streptococci determined the incidence, the time of onset, the duration, and the severity of the disease, the severity being a blend of degree of inflammation, tendency to relapse, and occurrence of ankylosis. whole group a usually failed to induce arthritis. group a disrupted with sonication regularly induced arthritis after a 24-hour latent period. the disease lasted over 60 days  and caused ankylosis. whole group b regularly induced arthritis but only after a  latent period of 6-8 days. the disease lasted over 40 days and caused ankylosed joints. with sonicated group b a similar disease was induced, except that, as with sonicated group a, the latent period was 24 hours. whole group d induced disease after a latent period of 48 hours. the arthritis lasted only 2 weeks and  was transient. in contrast to its effects on group a and b cocci, sonication of group d abrogated its capacity to induce arthritis. it is postulated that for whole streptococci, in contrast to sonicated streptococci, arthritogenicity depends on the sensitivity of the cocci to initial processing in vivo. processing may be partial digestion by enzymes of phagocytes. cocci such as those of group a that are insensitive to processing, injected whole, tend not to cause arthritis,  but when they do cause disease, it is chronic. a coccus, such as one of group d,  that is very sensitive to processing produces a transient arthritis after a short latent period, while a coccus of intermediate sensitivity, such as one of group b, induces disease only after a substantial latent period, and the disease is severe and chronic. the nature of processing remains to be determined.

TI  == heterogeneity of tetracycline resistance determinants in streptococcus.
AB  == we found that naturally occurring tetracycline resistance in streptococci is encoded by more than one genetic determinant. two of these distinct determinants  were cloned, and the regions that are necessary and sufficient for expression of  tetracycline resistance were defined by deletion analysis. these cloned determinants were further characterized by dna-dna hybridization experiments which also identified a third genetically unrelated tetracycline resistance determinant. some of these genetic differences appear to represent mechanistic differences. the tetl determinant was associated with small nonconjugative plasmids and mediated resistance to tetracycline. the tetm determinant was most often "nonplasmid" associated and mediated resistance to minocycline as well as tetracycline. the tetn determinant was represented on a large conjugative plasmid and was genetically distinct from tetl and tetm, although phenotypically it resembled tetm.

TI  == homology among tet determinants in conjugative elements of streptococci.
AB  == a mutation to tetracycline sensitivity in a resistant strain of streptococcus pneumoniae was shown by several criteria to be due to a point mutation in the conjugative omega (cat-tet) element found in the chromosomes of strains derived from bm6001, a clinical strain resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. strains carrying the mutation were transformed back to tetracycline resistance with the high efficiency of a point marker by donor deoxyribonucleic acids from its ancestral strain and from nine other clinical isolates of pneumococcus and by deoxyribonucleic acids from group d streptococcus faecalis and group b streptococcus agalactiae strains that also carry conjugative tet elements in their chromosomes. it was not transformed to resistance by tet plasmid deoxyribonucleic acids from either gram-negative or gram-positive species, except for one that carried transposon tn916, the conjugative tet element present in the chromosomes of some s. faecalis strains. the results showed that the tet determinants in conjugative elements of several streptococcal species share a high degree of deoxyribonucleic acid sequence homology and suggested that they differ from other tet genes.

AB  == clinical isolates of group d streptococci have been examined by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (cie) to determine if this method might be of value  in the rapid identification of the members of this group. group d organisms identified by classical biochemical and serologic procedures were inoculated into todd hewitt broth and incubated at 37 degrees c. after 4 hours of incubation, free group d streptococcal antigen was detected in broth cultures from 70 of 70 group d enterococcal strains. precipitin lines were readily visible immediately after electrophoresis in each case. in contrast, 10 nonenterococcal group d strains failed to produce detectable free group d antigen in the todd hewitt broth after 4, 24, or 48 hours incubation. such antigen was detectable, however,  after 48 hours incubation in mueller hinton broth containing 10 grams of glucose  per liter. representative strains of group a, c, g, and b streptococi, streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pneumoniae grown in todd-hewitt broth for 4 hours gave no precipitin lines when reacted against adsorbed monospecific group d antiserum. group d antigen was also detected in broth cultures of direct  swabs and in 18-hour blood culture broths. cie appears to be a rapid and sensitive procedure for identification of the enterococcal strains of group d streptococci from clinical isolates.

TI  == streptococci isolated from bovine intramammary infections.
AB  == streptococcal isolates from 71 dairy herds considered free of streptococcus agalactiae were compared with isolates from 1 herd used in bovine mastitis research over a 12-year period. the incidence of streptococci was as follows: streptococcus uberis, 56.5%; enterococci, 24.2%; streptococcus dysgalactiae, 9.0%; streptococcus bovis, 5.1%; unclassified streptococci, 3.1%; streptococcus agalactiae, 1.5%; and lancefield group g streptococci, 0.7%. the incidence for these streptococci in the 2 groups was generally the same except for str bovis and unclassified streptococci. a study of cultural responses in numerous mediums  indicated that differentiation of streptococci recovered from the bovine udder may be obtained with esculin broth, camp test, sodium hippurate broth, 0.1% methylene blue milk, inulin, and raffinose broths.

TI  == importance of streptococci as pathogens in the urinary tract.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis, while the most common streptococcal serotype causing urinary tract infection, is not the only one. lancefield group a, b, c and g serotypes are capable of invading the urinary tract. this finding is not generally appreciated. the reason for this anomaly is seen in the failure of most investigators to utilise a definitive procedure to group streptococcal isolates from urine. streptococci are responsible for 8.5 percent of urinary tract infections in this hospital.

TI  == selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. s. agalactiae and s. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered  poorly or not at all. the organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. these data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.

TI  == streptococcal infections--updated.
AB  == streptococci are amont the most common bacterial pathogens physicians encounter in practice. infections with streptococci continue to occur with significant frequency despite the general sensitivity of these organisms to a variety of widely used antibiotics. in newborn infants and other special patient groups, streptococci may produce fulminant and fatal sepsis (table 1). in normal children and adults, infections usually are short term and often mild or unrecognized but  with the possibility of resulting, unpredictably, in nonsuppurative complications some weeks or months later. although scarlet fever has become an unusual and clinically attenuated disease, its rashless analog, streptococcal pharyngitis, presents thorny problems in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic patients and in the detection of subclinical infections. erysipelas now is a rare disease, but recent studies have confirmed that streptococci often are the primary etiologic agent in impetigo, another type of skin infection--with peculiar bacteriologic and epidemiologic features. infections with group d streptococci have always been a special case because of their frequent resistance to penicillin, and group b streptococci (also somewhat resistant) present special problems in the perinatal period. streptococci may appear in unexpected places or guises (see table 1). thus, the modern physician has little reason to relax in his vigilance for and knowledge of streptococcal infections.

TI  == herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four danish dairy. districts ii. evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  == bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four danish dairy districts. after a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. the rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to  12% on a quarter basis. a comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has  taken place during that period. in particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of group b, c, g, and l streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of staphylococcus aureus. a comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 english herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower  level of infection was reached than in the 399 danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. the annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at d.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of d.kr. 42 million on account of the danish mastitis control. the total annual expenditure on danish mastitis control is estimated at d.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million d.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on  drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.

TI  == subclinical mastitis in suckler cows.
AB  == in a two-year study of the incidence of subclinical mastitis in two beef suckler  herds over 2400 quarter milk samples from 180 cows were examined. somatic cell counts and total bacterial counts were carried out and infecting organisms were isolated on sheep blood agar. results of these tests indicated that: (a) in spite of extremely dirty udders, fewer contaminants were found in the suckler cow milk  samples than in a group of over 1700 samples from typical dairy herds; (b) 18 per cent of all quarter milk samples were infected; (c) 67 per cent of all infections were due to staphylococci and 20 per cent to streptococci; (d) 56 per cent of staphylococcal infections were associated with cell counts less than 500,000 per  ml compared with 39 per cent of other infections; (e) 70 per cent of samples had  somatic cell counts less than 500,000 per ml. (f) 20 per cent of samples had somatic cell counts over 1 million per ml; (g) only 36 per cent of samples with cell counts over 1 million per ml were associated with udder infections; (h) high cell counts and udder infections were more frequent in early than in mid-lactation. due to a shortage of animals in the late lactation little evidence was available to support the contention that cell counts rise and the numbers of  infected quarters increase towards the end of lactation.

TI  == cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group d streptococci.
AB  == a long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group d streptococci that were examined, five strains of streptococcus faecalis, single strains of s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and s. durans, and three strains of streptococcus spp. in one strain of s. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. the core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. it resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the s. faecalis strains. cores were not present  in single strains of s. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group a), s. agalactiae (group b), s. dysgalactiae (group c), s. equisimilis (group c), and s. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus megaterium. cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group d streptococci. for preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
