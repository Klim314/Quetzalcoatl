TI  == polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) accumulation in sulfate-reducing bacteria and identification of a class iii pha synthase (phaec) in desulfococcus multivorans.
AB  == seven strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) were tested for the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (phas). during growth with benzoate desulfonema magnum accumulated large amounts of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [poly(3hb)]. desulfosarcina  variabilis (during growth with benzoate), desulfobotulus sapovorans (during growth with caproate), and desulfobacterium autotrophicum (during growth with caproate) accumulated poly(3hb) that accounted for 20 to 43% of cell dry matter.  desulfobotulus sapovorans and desulfobacterium autotrophicum also synthesized copolyesters consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyvalerate when valerate  was used as the growth substrate. desulfovibrio vulgaris and desulfotalea psychrophila were the only srb tested in which phas were not detected. when total dna isolated from desulfococcus multivorans and specific primers deduced from highly conserved regions of known pha synthases (phac) were used, a pcr product homologous to the central region of class iii pha synthases was obtained. the complete pha locus of desulfococcus multivorans was subsequently obtained by inverse pcr, and it contained adjacent phae(dm) and phac(dm) genes. phac(dm) and  phae(dm) were composed of 371 and 306 amino acid residues and showed up to 49 or  23% amino acid identity to the corresponding subunits of other class iii pha synthases. constructs of phac(dm) alone (pbbrmcs-2::phac(dm)) and of phae(dm)c(dm) (pbbrmcs-2::phae(dm)c(dm)) in various vectors were obtained and transferred to several strains of escherichia coli, as well as to the pha-negative mutants phb(-)4 and gpp104 of ralstonia eutropha and pseudomonas putida, respectively. in cells of the recombinant strains harboring phae(dm)c(dm) small but significant amounts (up to 1.7% of cell dry matter) of poly(3hb) and of pha synthase activity (up to 1.5 u/mg protein) were detected. this indicated that the cloned genes encode functionally active proteins. hybrid synthases consisting of phac(dm) and phae of thiococcus pfennigii or synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6308 were also constructed and were shown to be functionally active.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
