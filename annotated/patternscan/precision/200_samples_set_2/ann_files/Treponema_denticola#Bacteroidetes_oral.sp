TI  == periimplant bacteria associated with different transmucosal designs or smoking habits.
AB  == purpose: this study is to compare periimplant microbiota associated with implant  transmucosal designs or smoking habits. methods: submucosal samples from healthy  52 implants were collected for analysis of bacteria associated with bone-level (n = 37) or tissue-level (n = 15) implants or smoking habits, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. profiles of periimplant bacteria of smokers (n = 5) were investigated using phylochip array version g3 and compared with nonsmokers (n = 5). results: the number of bone-level implants positive for at least 1 pathogen was higher than that of tissue level; however, differences in each bacterium were insignificant. the prevalence and abundance of treponema denticola in smokers were significantly higher than that in nonsmokers (p < 0.05). smokers  and nonsmokers exhibited similar periimplant microbiota based on the phylochip array, but they could be distinguished by limiting observations to only 18 operational taxonomic units. streptococcus macedonicus within firmicutes and prevotella within bacteroidetes were more abundant in smokers compared with nonsmokers. conclusion: prevalence of putative pathogens with bone-level implants was higher than tissue-level implants in nonsmokers. firmicutes and bacteroidetes were significantly higher in smokers. smoking therefore strongly influenced peri-implant bacterial composition of bone-level implant.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile and production of proinflammatory cytokines in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == this review examines literature data concerning the bacterial findings in chronic periodontitis depending on pocket depth, and presents the latest published information on the presence of proinflammatory factors in periodontal environment. it has been found that chronic periodontitis affects as much as 80%  of the middle-aged population; by comparison, the prevalence of aggressive periodontitis reaches up to 1-1.5%. it is accepted that this social disease is multifactorial in etiology, but the evidence in the literature suggests that the  levels of specific gram-negative organisms in subgingival plaque biofilm play a major role in the initiation and progression of the disease. of the many bacterial species inhabiting the periodontal environment, three types--porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf)--are strongly associated with the initiation and progression of periodontitis. microbiological studies suggest that porphyromonas gingivalis should be considered a major etiologic agent. currently, porphyromonas gingivalis is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis. on the other hand, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemeomitans in patients with chronic periodontitis may be related to the severity of the disease and thus modify the therapeutic plan. the increased amount of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival area can activate a cascade of defense mechanisms of the body associated with the production of factors causing inflammation and destruction, which suggests a correlation between the bacterial findings and the body response implemented by enhancing the local cytokine expression. studies in the literature show that the presence of certain micro-organisms in the periodontal environment  is associated to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the gingival fluid and gingival tissue. these levels have been associated with destructive tissues response. there is little evidence in the literature on the correlation of the levels of periodontal pathogens of sites with different pocket depth with  periodontal disease activity defined by the degree of the proinflammatory cytokine expression such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin 6 (il-6).

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis: major periodontopathic pathogen overview.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative oral anaerobe that is involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and is a member of more than 500 bacterial species  that live in the oral cavity. this anaerobic bacterium is a natural member of the oral microbiome, yet it can become highly destructive (termed pathobiont) and proliferate to high cell numbers in periodontal lesions: this is attributed to its arsenal of specialized virulence factors. the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of one of the main periodontal pathogens-porphyromonas gingivalis. this bacterium, along with treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, constitute the "red complex," a prototype polybacterial pathogenic consortium in periodontitis. this review outlines porphyromonas gingivalis structure, its metabolism, its ability to colonize the epithelial cells, and its  influence upon the host immunity.

TI  == periodontal pathogens and associated factors in aggressive periodontitis: results 5-17 years after active periodontal therapy.
AB  == objectives: to assess the association between presence of periodontal pathogens and recurrence of disease in patients with aggressive periodontitis (agp) after active periodontal therapy (apt) and further influencing factors. material & methods: microbiological samples were taken from 73 patients with agp 5-17 years  after apt at 292 sites (deepest site per quadrant). real-time polymerase chain reactions were used to detect the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. uni- and multivariate analyses evaluated the associations between pathogens and recurrence of disease, smoking and adjunctive antibiotic therapy. results: at re-examination a. actinomycetemcomitans could be detected in six patients (8.2%), p. gingivalis in 24 (32.9%), t. forsythia in 31 (42.5%) and  t. denticola in 35 (48.0%). increased levels of t. forsythia and t. denticola at  re-examination were significantly associated with recurrence of disease in multivariate analyses (or: 12.72, p < 0.001; or 5.55, p = 0.002 respectively). furthermore, high counts of t. denticola were found in patients with increased percentage of sites with clinical attachment levels (cal) >/= 6 mm compared to those with low counts (13.8% versus 3.2%, p = 0.005). conclusion: in patients with recurrence of disease t. forsythia and t. denticola were detected more frequently and in higher counts. furthermore, t. denticola was found more frequently in patients with increased cal.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes identify distinct periodontitis phenotypes.
AB  == the currently recognized principal forms of periodontitis-chronic and aggressive-lack an unequivocal, pathobiology-based foundation. we explored whether gingival tissue transcriptomes can serve as the basis for an alternative  classification of periodontitis. we used cross-sectional whole-genome gene expression data from 241 gingival tissue biopsies obtained from sites with periodontal pathology in 120 systemically healthy nonsmokers with periodontitis,  with available data on clinical periodontal status, subgingival microbial profiles, and serum igg antibodies to periodontal microbiota. adjusted model-based clustering of transcriptomic data using finite mixtures generated two distinct clusters of patients that did not align with the current classification  of chronic and aggressive periodontitis. differential expression profiles primarily related to cell proliferation in cluster 1 and to lymphocyte activation and unfolded protein responses in cluster 2. patients in the two clusters did not differ with respect to age but presented with distinct phenotypes (statistically  significantly different whole-mouth clinical measures of extent/severity, subgingival microbial burden by several species, and selected serum antibody responses). patients in cluster 2 showed more extensive/severe disease and were more often male. the findings suggest that distinct gene expression signatures in pathologic gingival tissues translate into phenotypic differences and can provide a basis for a novel classification.

TI  == bis-enoxacin blocks rat alveolar bone resorption from experimental periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial, caused by polymicrobial subgingival pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. chronic periodontal infection results in inflammation, destruction of connective tissues, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone resorption, and ultimately tooth loss. enoxacin and a bisphosphonate derivative of enoxacin (bis-enoxacin) inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption and also contain antibiotic properties. our study proposes that enoxacin and/or bis-enoxacin may be useful in reducing alveolar bone resorption and possibly bacterial colonization. rats were infected with 10(9) cells of polymicrobial inoculum consisting of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, as an oral  lavage every other week for twelve weeks. daily subcutaneous injections of enoxacin (5 mg/kg/day), bis-enoxacin (5, 25 mg/kg/day), alendronate (1, 10 mg/kg/day), or doxycycline (5 mg/day) were administered after 6 weeks of polymicrobial infection. periodontal disease parameters, including bacterial colonization/infection, immune response, inflammation, alveolar bone resorption,  and systemic spread, were assessed post-euthanasia. all three periodontal pathogens colonized the rat oral cavity during polymicrobial infection. polymicrobial infection induced an increase in total alveolar bone resorption, intrabony defects, and gingival inflammation. treatment with bis-enoxacin significantly decreased alveolar bone resorption more effectively than either alendronate or doxycycline. histologic examination revealed that treatment with bis-enoxacin and enoxacin reduced gingival inflammation and decreased apical migration of junctional epithelium. these data support the hypothesis that bis-enoxacin and enoxacin may be useful for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola exhibit metabolic symbioses.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola are strongly associated with chronic periodontitis. these bacteria have been co-localized in subgingival plaque and demonstrated to exhibit symbiosis in growth in vitro and synergistic virulence upon co-infection in animal models of disease. here we show that during continuous co-culture a p. gingivalis:t. denticola cell ratio of 6ratio1 was maintained with a respective increase of 54% and 30% in cell numbers when compared with mono-culture. co-culture caused significant changes in global gene  expression in both species with altered expression of 184 t. denticola and 134 p. gingivalis genes. p. gingivalis genes encoding a predicted thiamine biosynthesis  pathway were up-regulated whilst genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis were down-regulated. t. denticola genes encoding virulence factors including dentilisin and glycine catabolic pathways were significantly up-regulated during  co-culture. metabolic labeling using 13c-glycine showed that t. denticola rapidly metabolized this amino acid resulting in the production of acetate and lactate. p. gingivalis may be an important source of free glycine for t. denticola as mono-cultures of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to produce and consume free glycine, respectively; free glycine production by p. gingivalis was stimulated by t. denticola conditioned medium and glycine supplementation of t. denticola medium increased final cell density 1.7-fold. collectively these data show p. gingivalis and t. denticola respond metabolically to the presence of each other with t. denticola displaying responses that help explain enhanced virulence of co-infections.

TI  == major membrane protein tde2508 regulates adhesive potency in treponema denticola.
AB  == the cultivation and genetic manipulation of treponema denticola, a gram-negative  oral spirochaeta associated with periodontal diseases, is still challenging. in this study, we formulated a simple medium based on a commercially available one,  and established a transformation method with high efficiency. we then analyzed proteins in a membrane fraction in t. denticola and identified 16 major membrane-associated proteins, and characterized one of them, tde2508, whose biological function was not yet known. although this protein, which exhibited a complex conformation, was presumably localized in the outer membrane, we did not  find conclusive evidence that it was exposed on the cell surface. intriguingly, a tde2508-deficient mutant exhibited significantly increased biofilm formation and  adherent activity on human gingival epithelial cells. however, the protein deficiency did not alter autoaggregation, coaggregation with porphyromonas gingivalis, hemagglutination, cell surface hydrophobicity, motility, or expression of msp which was reported to be an adherent molecule in this bacteria. in conclusion, the major membrane protein tde2508 regulates biofilm formation and the adhesive potency of t. denticola, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

TI  == subgingival periodontal pathogens associated with chronic periodontitis in yemenis.
AB  == background: subgingival microbial profile associated with periodontitis has been  reported to significantly differ by geographical location. the purpose of this study was to assess the association between a panel of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens and chronic periodontitis among yemenis. methods: subgingival dna samples were obtained from diseased and healthy sites of 20 non-smoking, moderate to severe chronic periodontitis subjects. absolute counts (bacterial dna copies per sample) and relative counts (% total bacteria) of seven periopathogenic species/genera representative of the red and orange complexes were determined using taqman q-pcr assays. results: the q-pcr assays showed excellent linearity (r2 > 0.99) and a sensitivity of 100 copies/sample. the detection rate was 100% for all tested species/genera except for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans that were detected at 97.5% and 67.5%, respectively. the median log absolute counts were in the range of 2.41-6.53 copies per sample while median relative counts were in the range of 0.001-0.77%, both being highest for fusobacteria and lowest for a. actinomycetemcomitans. significant interspecies correlations were observed. adjusting for multiple comparisons (p</=0.0063), only t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. micra maintained significant association with periodontal destruction. the latter species, however, showed the strongest association and was found in higher proportions at the periodontitis sites across all subjects (3.39 median fold increase). no significant differences were observed for p. gingivalis. conclusions: p. micra rather than p. gingivalis  appears as a keystone pathogen in this yemeni sample. however, these findings need to be validated in a larger-scale study before they can be claimed to represent ethnic variations in pathogens' association with periodontitis.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == oral prophylaxis and its effects on halitosis-associated and inflammatory parameters in patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: a controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of oral prophylaxis on halitosis-associated, immunological and microbiological parameters. methods: thirty subjects were included in this controlled clinical trial (patients with generalized chronic periodontitis and controls without clinical attachment loss; each n = 15). before oral prophylaxis and 14 days after (including tongue cleaning) volatile sulphur compounds (vsc), organoleptic scores and a tongue coating index were evaluated. the levels of il-1beta, il-8, il-10 and mmp-8 were measured in gcf, and also major periodontal pathogens were detected. data were statistically analysed using anova and paired t-test. results: supragingival plaque and calculus removal with combined tongue cleaning  was able to reduce significantly (p < 0.05) the vsc values in both groups (no significant differences between both groups). two weeks after periodontal debridement, the vsc values were observed in the periodontitis group, but not in  the control group, similar to the baseline values. the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). only a repeated prophylaxis session in the periodontitis group was able to reduce vsc values significantly in comparison with baseline (p < 0.05). organoleptic scores (10 and 30 cm) were significantly different (p < 0.05) between both groups before and after the treatment. periodontal pathogens and host-derived markers were not significantly  affected by a single prophylaxis session. conclusions: oral prophylaxis may result in a significant decrease in vsc values. however, in periodontal diseases, a more complex treatment seems to be necessary.

TI  == oral hygiene reinforcement in the simplified periodontal treatment of 1 hour.
AB  == aim: to compare the clinical and microbiological outcome of the 1-h ultrasonic debridement of chronic periodontitis patients (cpp) with and without frequent sessions of oral hygiene reinforcement. methods: clinical measurements and subgingival plaque were collected from 44 cpp at baseline, 3- and 6-months. the control group received a single session of 1-h full-mouth ultrasonic debridement, while oral hygiene instructions (ohi) were reiterated over four visits. in the test group, ohi were limited in the 1-h treatment session. at 3-months, both groups received additional debridement and ohi. the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique quantified porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in plaque. results: at three months, smaller reductions in plaque and bleeding indices, and in p. gingivalis numbers were noted in the test group, while these differences disappeared at six months. after the 3-month  re-treatment visit, the test group presented with a greater probing pocket depth  (ppd) reduction. plaque negatively affected ppd in a similar manner after both treatment approaches. conclusions: lack of oral hygiene reinforcement in the 1-h  full-mouth debridement resulted in higher plaque and bleeding scores and numbers  of p. gingivalis at three months; professional removal of dental biofilm every three months is beneficial in subjects with compromised plaque control.

TI  == oxantel disrupts polymicrobial biofilm development of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == bacterial pathogens commonly associated with chronic periodontitis are the spirochete treponema denticola and the gram-negative, proteolytic species porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. these species rely on complex  anaerobic respiration of amino acids, and the anthelmintic drug oxantel has been  shown to inhibit fumarate reductase (frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit p. gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation. here, we demonstrate that  oxantel inhibited p. gingivalis frd activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration  (ic50) of 2.2 mum and planktonic growth of t. forsythia with a mic of 295 mum, but it had no effect on the growth of t. denticola. oxantel treatment caused the  downregulation of six p. gingivalis gene products and the upregulation of 22 gene products. all of these genes are part of a regulon controlled by heme availability. there was no large-scale change in the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating that p. gingivalis may be unable to overcome frd inhibition. oxantel disrupted the development of polymicrobial biofilms composed  of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in a concentration-dependent manner. in these biofilms, all three species were inhibited to a similar degree,  demonstrating the synergistic nature of biofilm formation by these species and the dependence of t. denticola on the other two species. in a murine alveolar bone loss model of periodontitis oxantel addition to the drinking water of p. gingivalis-infected mice reduced bone loss to the same level as the uninfected control.

TI  == inter-bacterial correlations in subgingival biofilms: a large-scale survey.
AB  == aim: although the complexity of the oral ecology and the ecological differences between health and disease are well accepted, a clear view on the dynamics in relation to disease is lacking. in this study, the prevalence and abundance of 20 key oral bacteria was assessed in health and disease and more importantly a closer look was given to the inter-bacterial relationships. materials and methods: a blinded microbiological database was analysed in this cross-sectional, retrospective study. the database was constructed based on microbiological analyses of samples from 6308 patients, with gradations of periodontitis (healthy to periodontitis). data concerning the abundance of 20 oral bacteria and probing  pocket depth were provided. results: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas micra and porphyromonas intermedia showed a clear increase in abundance and prevalence with increasing pocket depth. correlation matrices illustrated that almost all microorganisms were in one way correlated to other species and most of these correlations were significant. several beneficial bacteria showed strong correlations with other beneficial bacteria. conclusion: knowledge on bacterial correlations can pave the way for new treatment options focusing on restoring the shifted balance.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola synergistic polymicrobial biofilm development.
AB  == chronic periodontitis has a polymicrobial biofilm aetiology and interactions between key bacterial species are strongly implicated as contributing to disease  progression. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia have all been implicated as playing roles in disease progression. p. gingivalis cell-surface-located protease/adhesins, the gingipains, have been suggested to be involved in its interactions with several other bacterial species. the aims of this study were to determine polymicrobial biofilm formation by p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia, as well as the role of p. gingivalis gingipains in biofilm formation by using a gingipain null triple mutant. to determine homotypic and polymicrobial biofilm formation a flow cell system was employed and the biofilms imaged and quantified by fluorescent in situ hybridization using dna species-specific probes and confocal scanning laser microscopy imaging. of the three species, only p. gingivalis and t. denticola formed mature, homotypic biofilms, and a strong synergy was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola in polymicrobial biofilm formation. this synergy was  demonstrated by significant increases in biovolume, average biofilm thickness and maximum biofilm thickness of both species. in addition there was a morphological  change of t. denticola in polymicrobial biofilms when compared with homotypic biofilms, suggesting reduced motility in homotypic biofilms. p. gingivalis gingipains were shown to play an essential role in synergistic polymicrobial biofilm formation with t. denticola.

TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == molecular microbiological evaluation of subgingival biofilm sampling by paper point and curette.
AB  == the present clinical study aimed to investigate if there are differences in microbiological outcomes dependent on the subgingival biofilm collection method.  subgingival biofilm samples were collected from the four deepest pockets (>5 mm)  of 17 patients with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and 33 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), first by paper point and thereafter by curette. samples obtained with the same method were pooled together from each patient and forwarded for molecular microbiological analysis by a commercially available assay (iai pado test 4.5) that estimates total bacterial load and levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. data analysis included frequency of detection, quantification and correlation of detection levels between the two sampling methods. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola were detected in >90% of the samples, and their detection levels exhibited a strong correlation between sampling methods. the detection consistency of a. actinomycetemcomitans was 56% between the two sampling methods. a. actinomycetemcomitans was more readily detected by paper point compared with curette collection with a stronger  correlation between the two methods in agp. subgingival biofilm sampling by curette or paper point does not yield differences in the detection of the three 'red complex' species. however, a. actinomycetemcomitans was more consistently detected by means of paper point collection, which can be crucial in the decision to administer antibiotics as an adjunctive periodontal treatment.

TI  == oral microbial colonization in laryngectomized patients as a possible cofactor of biofilm formation on their voice prostheses.
AB  == aim: biofilm formation on voice prostheses, which are used for voice rehabilitation in laryngectomized patients, is a main cause of device failure. the aim of this study was to assess whether the presence of periodontal pathogens in the biofilm on voice prostheses is related to that in the oral cavity and associated with the periodontal status of the patients. methods: thirty-one laryngectomized patients were invited to participate, 13 of whom met exclusion criteria. the remaining 18 were classified according to the community periodontal index of treatment needs (community periodontal index of treatment needs (cpitn), grades 0-4). biofilm samples from the oral cavity and voice prostheses were analysed by pcr-based hybridization for 11 pathogens. results: all dentate patients required periodontal treatment (cpitn-3: n = 4, cpitn-4: n = 8); the remaining six were edentulous. the diversity (i.e. number of bacterial species detected) of pathogens detected on the voice prostheses correlated significantly  positively with the diversity of pathogens in the oral cavity and with clinical parameters. furthermore, the diversity of pathogens differed significantly between dentate and edentulous patients. conclusions: results emphasize the oral  cavity as an important source of bacteria for biofilm formation on voice prostheses. whether these pathogens reduce the lifetime of the device by increased biofilm formation and/or increase the risk of silicone deterioration requires further study.

TI  == quantification of key periodontal pathogens in insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic  and non-diabetic patients with generalized chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is a common problem in patients with diabetes mellitus (dm), however, differences in the putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with dm compared to non-dm subjects are still inconclusive. the red complex, which includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, encompasses the most important pathogens in adult periodontal disease. the aim of the present study was to compare cell numbers of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, t.  forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in gingival sulcus of healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis sites of non-diabetes mellitus (ndm), controlled and poorly controlled insulin-dependent dm (cdm and pdm) patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were collected from 19 cdm, 19 pdm and 19 ndm patients. taqman real time-pcr was used to determine bacterial cell number. at subject level, the quantity of red complex bacteria was significantly higher in pdm than those of ndm and positively correlated with hba1c. at site level (total 342 sites), cell numbers of t. denticola and t. forsythia in healthy sites of cdm and pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm. in gingivitis sites, the numbers of p. gingivalis in cdm and pdm and t. forsythia in pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm while in periodontitis sites, higher quantity of p. gingivalis in pdm was observed. our study indicated that poor glycemic control is associated with increasing cell numbers of red complex bacteria in subgingival biofilm.

TI  == [detection of periodontal pathogens from saliva of type 2 diabetic patients in urban area of beijing].
AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence of periodontal pathogens from saliva of  patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm), and to characterize the association between the glucose status and periodontal pathogens in oral cavity.  methods: all the subjects were hypertension patients under regular care at beijing hypertension prevention and management institute. whole unstimulated saliva samples were collected from 45 non-diabetic subjects (non-dm group), 80 well-controlled diabetic patients (dm-well group) and 100 poor-controlled diabetic patients (dm-poor group). dna was extracted from the salivary deposition, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf) and treponema denticola (td) were detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method  based on 16srrna. prevalence and quantity of the pathogens under different glucose states were compared and logistic regression model was set to analyze the factors related to each bacterium. results: the prevalence of tf in dm-well group and dm-poor group was significantly lower than that of non-dm group [81% (65/80), 80% (80/100) vs 91% (41/45), p = 0.048], meanwhile the quantity of tf was also lower than that of non-dm group [1.9(2.6), 2.1(5.3) vs 3.4(6.4)] (p > 0.05). with the worsening of glucose control, the quantity of tf was declining (p = 0.032). however, the prevalence and the quantity of pg, td in 3 groups had no statistical differences (p > 0.05). after adjusting age, gender, number of missing teeth and  other periodontal parameters, or of having tf in saliva from dm-well group and dm-poor group was 0.58 and 0.53, respectively. conclusions: abnormal blood glucose state may affect the colonization of tf in oral cavity.

TI  == periodontopathogens levels and clinical response to periodontal therapy in individuals with the interleukin-4 haplotype associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results from an interaction between dental biofilm agents and the host immune-inflammatory response. periodontopathogenic organisms, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, as well as the host's susceptibility, represented by the host's genetic makeup, are the key factors that influence this complex disease. recently, we identified haplotypes in the il4 gene that were associated with chronic periodontitis (cp). this study aimed to evaluate whether  subjects with different il4 haplotypes (tci/cci and ttd/cti) would be differentially colonized by periodontopathogens and whether they would respond differently to non-surgical periodontal therapy. thirty-nine patients carrying the il4 haplotype of genetic susceptibility to cp (il4+) or protection against cp (il4-) were evaluated. those groups were further subdivided into individuals with cp (cp il4+ or cp il4-) and those that were periodontally healthy (h) (h il4+ or  h il4-). cp patients were submitted to non-surgical periodontal therapy. clinical and microbiological analyses were performed considering the data at baseline and  45 and 90 days after periodontal therapy. periodontopathogens levels were evaluated by absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). the baseline data revealed that the total levels of periodontopathogens were higher in the cp  il4+ than in the cp il4- groups. clinical analyses revealed that the periodontal  therapy was equally effective, independent of the subject's il4 genetic load. the tci/cci il4 haplotype, previously associated with genetic susceptibility to cp, was also associated with increased levels of periodontopathogenic bacteria, but this genetic background did not influence the response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  == clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics in patients with peri-implant mucositis.
AB  == purpose: to analyze the clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics (interleukins 1beta and 6) in the peri-implant sulcus fluid (pisf) of patients with healthy dental implants and with peri-implant mucositis.  materials and methods: clinical parameters (modified gingival index [mgi], modified plaque index [mpi], probing pocket depth [ppd], and absence or presence  of radiologic bone loss) were recorded, and pisf samples were obtained from peri-implant sites showing mucositis as well as healthy sites. the periodontopathogenic bacteria tannerella forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were evaluated, together with the total bacterial load (tbl) and the interleukin (il) 1beta and il-6 values. results: the study population consisted of 34 individuals, and 77 dental implants were evaluated during the study (23 mucositis and 54 healthy peri-implant sites). the  mgi, mpi, and ppd scores of the peri-implant mucositis group were significantly greater than in the healthy group. no differences in detection frequency were found for putative periodontal pathogens and tbl between the healthy peri-implant sites and mucositis sites. the mucositis group showed a significantly greater expression of il-6 than the healthy group (p < .05). although il-1beta was increased in the mucositis group, there was no statistically significant difference versus the healthy implant group. conclusions: an analysis was made of the clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics in implants with peri-implant mucositis, establishing comparisons with healthy implants. in the patients studied, bacterial plaque induced an inflammatory response that can lead to the development of peri-implant mucositis. adequate plaque control is therefore able to increase peri-implant health, avoiding the risk of future complications. no specific association to the studied bacterial species was established.

TI  == periodontopathogen profile of healthy and oral lichen planus patients with gingivitis or periodontitis.
AB  == oral lichen planus (olp) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently detected in oral tissues. the aim of our study was to identify the prevalence of  the detection of periodontopathogenic microorganisms (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in olp patients and to compare with  this prevalence of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in healthy non-olp patients. our study included 27 (18 chronic periodontitis (olpp) and 9 gingivitis (olpg)) patients diagnosed with olp along with 26 (13 chronic periodontitis (hp)  and 13 gingivitis (hg)) healthy non-olp patients. the multiplex polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization method (micro-ident) was used for identifying periodontopathogenic microorganisms present in subgingival plaque samples. the percentages of detection for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples taken from olp patients (olpg and olpp) were 18.5%, 85.1%, 81.4%, 88.8% and 74%, respectively. meanwhile, in the non-olp patients (hg and hp), these values were 7.6%, 50%, 46.1%, 73% and 57.7%, respectively. thus, comparing the non-olp groups with the olp groups, the periodontopathogens' percentages of detection in the olp groups were higher than those in the non-olp groups. according to our study results, olp patients have higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola than non-olp patients. we argue that the high percentages in patients with olp may help identify the importance of periodontopathogenic microorganisms  in the progress of periodontal diseases of olp.

TI  == differential expression of mitogen activating protein kinases in periodontitis.
AB  == aim: following toll-like receptor (tlr) engagement, lipopolysaccharide (lps) can  stimulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines thus activating the innate immune response. the production of inflammatory cytokines results, in part, from  the activation of kinase-induced signalling cascades and transcriptional factors. of the four distinct classes of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk) described in mammals, p38, c-jun n-terminal activated kinases (jnk1-3) and extracellular activated kinases (erk1,2) are the best studied. previous data have established that p38 mapk signalling is required for inflammation and bone loss in periodontal disease pre-clinical animal models. materials & methods: in this study, we obtained healthy and diseased periodontal tissues along with clinical parameters and microbiological parameters. excised fixed tissues were immunostained with total and phospho-specific antibodies against p38, jnk and erk kinases. results: intensity scoring from immunostained tissues was correlated with clinical periodontal parameters. rank correlations with clinical indices were statistically significantly positive (p-value < 0.05) for total p38 (correlations ranging 0.49-0.68), phospho-p38 (range 0.44-0.56), and total erk (range 0.52-0.59) levels, and correlations with jnk levels also supported association (range 0.42-0.59). phospho-jnk and phospho-erk showed no significant  positive correlation with clinical parameters of disease. conclusion: these data  strongly implicate p38 mapk as a major mapk involved in human periodontal inflammation and severity.

TI  == isolation of treponema and tannerella spp. from equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis related periodontal disease.
AB  == reasons for performing study: red complex bacteria, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, are involved in the onset and progression of periodontal disease in man, yet seldom inhabit the oral  cavity of healthy individuals. periodontal disease is also encountered in horses, with equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (eotrh) constituting a particular form of disease. however, only little is known about the oral microbiome of healthy and periodontitis-affected equids. objective: we aimed to test the hypothesis that red complex bacteria are also associated with eotrh-related periodontal disease. study design: controlled cross-sectional study. methods: we screened dna purified from crevicular fluid derived from 23 eotrh-affected and 21 disease-free horses for the presence of treponema spp., tannerella spp. and porphyromonas gingivalis dna by polymerase chain reaction. subsequently, amplified dna was bidirectionally sequenced and identified via blast analysis. results: treponema and/or tannerella dna was detected in 100% of  periodontitis-related samples and in 52.2% of dna derived from healthy horses. twenty-six amplicon sequences were 98-100% homologous to published bacterial sequences, which mostly corresponded to treponema pectinovorum, oral treponema clones ju025 and omz 840, and tannerella forsythia. p. gingivalis dna was only found in 3 eotrh-related samples. forty-three amplicon sequences revealed weaker  homologies ranging between 80% and 97% to known treponema or tannerella strains,  partly because of their heterogeneity, partly because they obviously represented  so far unknown types. conclusions: this is the first report in which known and novel treponema and tannerella spp. were isolated in association with eotrh-related periodontal disease.

TI  == serum antibody responses to periodontal microbiota in chronic and aggressive periodontitis: a postulate revisited.
AB  == background: the authors revisited the 1999 international workshop postulate of robust serum antibody responses to infecting agents in localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) and weak responses in generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). antibody responses were further examined in localized and generalized chronic periodontitis (lcp and gcp). methods: the study includes 119 patients (60 males and 59 females, aged 11 to 76 years), 18 with lagp, 37 with gagp, 37 with lcp, and 27 with gcp. multiple subgingival plaque samples/patient (1,057 in total) were analyzed with respect to 11 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations, and serum immunoglobulin (ig)g levels were measured against the same bacteria using checkerboard immunoblotting. further, infection ratios (antibody level over the average bacterial colonization by the homologous  species) were computed for each patient. comparisons of bacterial colonization, serum igg levels, and infection ratios were made across the diagnostic categories using multivariable linear regression models adjusting for age and race/ethnicity. results: there were no statistically significant differences in serum igg levels to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans among the four diagnostic categories. igg levels to several species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus, were highest in patients with gagp and significantly different from lcp and gcp, but not from lagp. comparisons based on infection ratios showed no statistically significant differences for any species between gagp and lagp. conclusion: this study provides evidence against the 1999 workshop's postulate of weak serum antibody responses in patients with gagp and shows that serum igg responses in gagp are comparable to those in lagp, but higher than in gcp or lcp for several species.

TI  == effect of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota over a 2-year monitoring period. i. overall effect and kinetics of change.
AB  == aim: to examine the 2-year post-therapy kinetics of change in the composition of  subgingival biofilms. material and methods: in this study, 178 chronic periodontitis subjects were recruited and clinically monitored at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after therapy. all subjects received scaling and root planing and 156 one or more of periodontal surgery, systemically administered amoxicillin + metronidazole or local tetracycline at pockets >/=5 mm. subgingival biofilm samples taken from each subject at each time point were analysed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the significance of changes in median species counts over time was sought using the wilcoxon or friedman tests and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: mean counts were significantly reduced from baseline to 2 years for 30 of the 40  taxa. marked reductions were observed for periodontal pathogens including tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and eubacterium nodatum. the kinetics of change differed from species to species. when data were subset according to baseline pd, patterns of change in the microbial profiles were generally similar. conclusion: periodontal therapy leads to a rapid reduction in periodontal pathogens, followed by a slower reduction in other taxa that can be sustained for at least 2 years.

TI  == determining the presence of periodontopathic virulence factors in short-term postmortem alzheimer's disease brain tissue.
AB  == the aim of this study was to establish a link between periodontal disease and alzheimer's disease (ad) with a view to identifying the major periodontal disease bacteria (treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and porphyromonas gingivalis) and/or bacterial components in brain tissue from 12 h postmortem delay. our request matched 10 ad cases for tissue from brains for dementia research alongside 10 non-ad age-related controls with similar or greater postmortem interval. we exposed svgp12, an astrocyte cell line, to culture supernatant containing lipopolysaccharide (lps) from the putative periodontal bacteria p. gingivalis. the challenged svgp12 cells and cryosections from ad and  control brains were immunolabeled and immunoblotted using a battery of antibodies including the anti-p. gingivalis-specific monoclonal antibody. immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated the svgp12 cell line was able to adsorb lps from culture supernatant on its surface membrane; similar labeling was observed in four out of 10 ad cases. immunoblotting demonstrated bands corresponding to lps from p. gingivalis in the svgp12 cell lysate and in the same four ad brain specimens which were positive when screened by immunofluorescence. all controls remained negative throughout while the same four cases were consistently positive for p. gingivalis lps (p = 0.029). this study confirms that lps from periodontal bacteria can access the ad brain during life as labeling in the corresponding controls, with equivalent/longer postmortem interval, was absent. demonstration of a known chronic oral-pathogen-related virulence factor reaching the human brains suggests an inflammatory role in the existing ad pathology.

TI  == association between il8 haplotypes and pathogen levels in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == chronic periodontitis (cp) is considered to be a multifactorial disease influenced by microbial and genetic factors. the aim of the present study was to  investigate whether the genetic susceptibility to cp in individuals with the il8  atc/ttc haplotype is associated with subgingival levels of periodontopathogens. sixty-five individuals, grouped according to the presence (n = 28) or absence (n  = 37) of the il8 haplotype, were evaluated. after clinical periodontal evaluation, each group was subdivided according to the presence (cp) or absence (h) of periodontitis. four subgingival samples were obtained from cp and two samples per subject from h patients. the levels and proportions of porphyromonas  gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr). no differences were found in the proportion of periodontopathogenic bacteria between groups with the  presence or absence of the il8 haplotype. however, in the cp groups, the levels of periodontopathogens were significantly higher in the individuals without the il8 haplotype than in the individuals with the il8 haplotype. these results suggest that periodontal destruction may occur in patients who are considered to  be genetically susceptible to cp with a lower microbial challenge because of the  presence of the il8 atc/ttc haplotype than in patients without this haplotype.

TI  == soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (strem-1) in gingival crevicular fluid: association with clinical and microbiologic parameters.
AB  == background: soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (strem-1) belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in amplification of the inflammatory response to bacterial infection. this cross-sectional study aims to  investigate the levels of strem-1 in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) of individuals without periodontitis and with chronic periodontitis (cp) or generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and their association with the levels of key periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. methods: gcf and subgingival  plaque samples were obtained from healthy sites of participants without periodontitis (n = 20) and periodontitis sites of patients with cp (n = 22) and gagp (n = 20). strem-1 levels in gcf were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans levels in subgingival plaque were analyzed  by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: strem-1 levels in gcf were higher in cp and gagp than healthy sites by 3.6- and 4.4-fold, respectively, with no significant differences between the two forms of periodontitis. moreover, strem-1 levels in gcf were positively correlated with site-specific clinical periodontal parameters and levels of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, but not a. actinomycetemcomitans, in subgingival plaque. conclusion: increased gcf levels of strem-1 at diseased sites and their positive correlation with clinical and microbiologic parameters strengthen the association of this inflammatory marker with periodontitis.

AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-mddcs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp) or healthy periodontal tissue (hp). design: m-mddcs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (il)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), were stimulated with lysates of streptococcus sanguinis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, or treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. il-10, il-12 and ifn-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. results: expression of hla-dr was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-mddc from cp compared to hp (p=0.04), while expression of cd1a and cd123 were higher in cp. the expression pattern of hla-dr, cd11c, cd123, and cd1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. stimulation with p. intermedia upregulated cd80 and cd86 in cp cells (p</=0.05). production of il-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-mddcs was 5.8-fold greater in cp compared to hp. bacterial stimulation further increased il-12p70 production while decreasing il-10. significantly more ifn-gamma was produced in co-cultures of cp m-mddcs than with hp m-mddcs when cells were stimulated with p. intermedia (p=0.009). conclusions: bacterial-unstimulated m-mddc from cp exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. p. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and ifn-gamma expression in cp m-mddc. these events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.

TI  == detection of oral bacterial dna in synovial fluid.
AB  == objectives: as periodontal bacteria might be involved in the aetiology of rheumatic diseases, we analysed synovial fluid obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and controls for the presence of dna of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. methods: in all, 42 patients suffering from ra (mean age 53.8 +/- 16.7 years, 40.4% females) and 114 controls  with no rheumatic diseases (mean age 56.1 +/- 15.2 years, 52.4% females) were included. dna from synovial fluid was isolated by qiaamp kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) specific for the 16s rrna genes of the above specified bacteria were developed. subgingival bacterial colonization was analysed using micro-ident((r)) test (hain-diagnostik, nehren, germany). results: in patients with ra dna of p. gingivalis was detected in synovial fluid  more often than in controls (15.7% versus 3.5%, p = 0.045). more patients than controls harboured dna from p. gingivalis in both, oral plaque and synovial fluid (11.9% versus. 0.9%, p = 0.030). among the patients group the number of missing teeth was correlated with the number of joints with movement restrictions caused  by ra. conclusions: dna of periodontopathogens can be found in synovial fluid and oral bacteria may play a role in the pathogenesis of arthritis.

TI  == polymicrobial infection with major periodontal pathogens induced periodontal disease and aortic atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic apoe(null) mice.
AB  == periodontal disease (pd) and atherosclerosis are both polymicrobial and multifactorial and although observational studies supported the association, the  causative relationship between these two diseases is not yet established. polymicrobial infection-induced periodontal disease is postulated to accelerate atherosclerotic plaque growth by enhancing atherosclerotic risk factors of orally infected apolipoprotein e deficient (apoe(null)) mice. at 16 weeks of infection,  samples of blood, mandible, maxilla, aorta, heart, spleen, and liver were collected, analyzed for bacterial genomic dna, immune response, inflammation, alveolar bone loss, serum inflammatory marker, atherosclerosis risk factors, and  aortic atherosclerosis. pcr analysis of polymicrobial-infected (porphyromonas gingivalis [p. gingivalis], treponema denticola [t. denticola], and tannerella forsythia [t. forsythia]) mice resulted in detection of bacterial genomic dna in  oral plaque samples indicating colonization of the oral cavity by all three species. fluorescent in situ hybridization detected p. gingivalis and t. denticola within gingival tissues of infected mice and morphometric analysis showed an increase in palatal alveolar bone loss (p<0.0001) and intrabony defects suggesting development of periodontal disease in this model. polymicrobial-infected mice also showed an increase in aortic plaque area (p<0.05) with macrophage accumulation, enhanced serum amyloid a, and increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides. a systemic infection was indicated by the detection of bacterial genomic dna in the aorta and liver of infected mice and elevated levels of bacterial specific igg antibodies (p<0.0001). this study was a unique effort to understand the effects of a polymicrobial infection with p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia on periodontal disease and associated atherosclerosis in apoe(null) mice.

AB  == objective: the replacement of missing teeth with dental implants has been standard practice in dentistry for many years. the success of dental implants depends on many factors, among which the diagnosis, clinical severity, and treatment of peri-implant diseases play a key role. in this prospective case series, the influence of cumulative treatment modalities on peri-implantitis with and without pus formation on clinical outcome was assessed. method and materials: during 2010, 28 patients were referred for peri-implantitis treatment. they presented two different types of peri-implant diseases: peri-implantitis with (17 implants) or without pus formation (33 implants). after microbiologic diagnosis,  all patients were treated at baseline with full-mouth scaling and root planing. two months later, further full-mouth scaling and root planing and additional antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) was applied. four months after baseline, patients with pus formation additionally underwent access flap surgery. active human matrix metalloproteinase-8 (ammp-8) levels were measured in eluates  before and after all treatment modalities and 7 months after baseline. results: clinical parameters (probing depth, bleeding on probing) and ammp-8-levels improved in both groups after treatment and the final examination. in periimplantitis patients without pus formation, all parameters decreased after full-mouth scaling and root planing and the additional apdt and no surgery was necessary to improve the parameters. in patients with pus formation, the parameters decreased only after access flap surgery. conclusion: the presence of  pus influences the clinical outcome of the treatment of peri-implant diseases. whereas peri-implantitis cases without pus formation can be successfully managed  nonsurgically, peri-implantitis with pus formation can be effectively treated after an additional observation time of 3 months postoperatively only with additional flap surgery.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens and metabolic control of type 1 diabetes patients.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque collected at different probing depths of type 1 diabetes patients with periodontal disease in correlation to metabolic control. methods: twenty-one patients 40 to 50 years old were included in the study. in each patient blood samples were taken for the evaluation of hba1c level and subgingival plaque samples were taken with paper points from the two deepest pockets. the presence of five periodontal pathogens was detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. results: the results of 38 plaque samples showed that  t. forsythia was found in 48% followed by t. denticola in 31%, p. gingivalis in 26%, p. intermedia in 9% and a. actinomycetemcomitans in 7%. t. forsythia and t.  denticola were the most frequent combination of periodontal pathogens found in the same sample. the serum level of hba1c in nine patients where t. forsythia was detected (7.5 +/- 1.4%) was significantly higher (f-test, p = 0.001) than in 12 patients where t. forsythia was not detected (6.8 +/- 0.5%). similarly, the serum level of hba1c was significantly higher (f-test, p = 0.001) in eight patients where t. denticola was detected (7.5 +/- 1.8%) compared to the 13 patients where  t. denticola was not detected (7.0 +/- 0.5%). no such correlation was found for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia or a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: we conclude that t. forsythia and t. denticola are most frequently found in subgingival plaque samples of type 1 diabetic patients and these findings correlate with poorer metabolic control of diabetes.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic effects of lingual cervical coverage by removable partial dentures.
AB  == purpose: the effect of gingival coverage by removable partial dentures (rpds) on  bacterial accumulation has not been sufficiently established. the aim of this study was to evaluate the periodontal and microbiologic reactions to mandibular major connectors. it was hypothesized that the use of a lingual plate increases the risk of periodontal disease. materials and methods: fourteen subjects (mean age: 69.0 years) received oral hygiene instructions and ultrasonic debridement prior to examination. each subject received an experimental rpd incorporating either a lingual bar or lingual plate for the first 8 weeks and was then switched to the other option for the next 8 weeks. clinical parameters (plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, and tooth mobility) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the periodontal pocket in the test site to measure the colonization of periodontal pathogens after the use of each denture.  results: the mean probing depth was significantly greater after use of the lingual plate compared to the lingual bar (p < .05), whereas the type of connector did not affect the levels of any of the microbial species. all subjects that exhibited at least one bacterial species showed smaller numbers of microorganisms at the second examination than at the first. conclusions: the lingual cervical coverage did not precipitate the accumulation of anaerobic microorganisms, although it could potentially induce gingival inflammation. the results suggest that a lingual plate can be used as safely as a lingual bar if oral and denture hygiene are carefully monitored.

TI  == treponema denticola associates with increased levels of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the aim was to assess the association between the presence of site-specific subgingival micro-organisms and the levels of matrix metalloproteinases-8 and matrix metalloproteinases-9 (mmp-8 and mmp-9) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). materials and methods: the patient group consisted of 56 subjects with periodontitis and the control group of 43 subjects  without periodontitis. gcf samples from four test sites for each subject were collected. polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. mmp-8 concentrations were analyzed by a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay, and mmp-9 levels were  determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. student's unpaired t-test, chi-square test, and fisher's exact p-value were calculated. results: the presence of t. denticola in the test sites was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group. the presence of t. forsythia and t. denticola was associated with increased levels of mmp-8 in the test sites. respectively, site-specific presence of t. denticola was associated with an increase in mmp-9 levels in three of the four test sites. conclusions: the presence of subgingival micro-organisms in gcf, particularly t. denticola, appeared to induce a host response with an increased release of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in the test sites.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == presence of oral bacterial species in primary endodontic infections of primary teeth.
AB  == objective: knowledge of the microbial composition of deciduous endodontic infections is limited. this study aimed to evaluate the presence of the 10 oral bacterial species in samples from primary tooth root canals by using microarray technology and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical conditions. study design: the samples were collected from 30 root canals of primary teeth with primer infection. the bacterial composition of the samples was semi-quantitatively defined using a microarray system (parocheck). results: all the tested species were detected in the samples. fusobacterium nucleatum was the  most frequently isolated bacterium (96.7%), followed by prevotella intermedia (86.7%), parvimonas micra (83.3%), treponema denticola (76.7%) and tannerella forsythia (66.7%). these bacteria were also present in high levels. all pairs of  bacterial species were positively associated (rr > 1), except pintermedia and p > micra. on average, five species (range:3-8) were detected per amplified sample. root canals of teeth with > 5 different species were statistically associated with periapical radiolucency (p = 0.049). conclusions: primary teeth with endodontic infections show a highly diverse variety of bacteria, in which the most prevalent specie are present in high proportions. the well-directed use of the improved microarray technology will provide additional valuable information for causative factors associated with endodontic diseases, helping to develop more successful antibacterial or anti-inflammatory treatment strategies.

TI  == [clinical importance and diagnosis of halitosis].
AB  == the origin of halitosis comes from the latin word "halitus" meaning 'breath, exhaled air', and in the hungarian terminology it means bad and smelly breath. the human body emits a number of volatile molecules, which have a peculiar odour. their presence is influenced by several factors, such as genetic, nutritional and psychological factors. since bad breath belongs to taboo subjects, halitosis can  often lead to social isolation. to determine the incidence of halitosis, an exact diagnosis is needed which sometimes predestinates the possible treatment as well. investigators estimate the incidence about 50% in the whole population. the male/female ratio is the same and the incidence is growing with age. the diagnosis can be genuine halitosis, pseudo halitosis and halitophobia. we can divide the genuine type into physiological and pathophysiological subtypes. the cause of the halitosis usually can be found in the oral cavity. the volatile sulfur compounds (vsc) produced by some of the oral bacteria are responsible for  its development. only 10% of the causes are extraoral, mostly inflammation of airways or gastrointestinal disorders. the judgment of halitosis is based on three objective methods: the organoleptic, the sulphide monitoring and the gas cromatography methods. since the origin of the halitosis is mainly the oral cavity, dentists should treat them. beyond the dental treatments the enhancement  of the oral hygiene, the continuous motivation and monitoring are also very important, such as the use of tongue cleansing and special anti-malodour rinses.

TI  == treponema denticola improves adhesive capacities of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important etiological agent of periodontal disease,  is frequently found associated with treponema denticola, an anaerobic spirochete, in pathogenic biofilms. however, interactions between these two bacteria are not  well understood at the molecular level. in this study, we seek to link the influence of t. denticola on the expression of p. gingivalis proteases with its capacities to adhere and to form biofilms. the p. gingivalis genes encoding arg-gingipain a (rgpa), lys-gingipain (kgp), and hemagglutinin a (haga) were more strongly expressed after incubation with t. denticola compared with p. gingivalis alone. the amounts of the three resulting proteins, all of which contain hemagglutinin adhesion domains, were increased in culture supernatants. moreover, incubation of p. gingivalis with t. denticola promoted static and dynamic biofilm formation, primarily via a time-dependent enhancement of p. gingivalis adhesion capacities on bacterial partners such as streptococcus gordonii. adhesion of p. gingivalis to human cells was also increased. these results showed that interactions of p. gingivalis with other bacterial species, such as t. denticola, induce increased adhesive capacities on various substrata by hemagglutinin adhesion domain-containing proteins.

TI  == influence of periodontal status and periodontopathogens on levels of oral human beta-defensin-2 in saliva.
AB  == background: expression patterns of human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) mrna or hbd-2 protein concentration and periodontal diseases have been a focus of scientific research. this study compares the salivary levels of hbd-2 protein concentration  of healthy patients and patients with gingivitis and chronic periodontitis (cp) and correlates these levels with the presence of periodontopathogens. methods: a  total of 89 patients were enrolled in this study: 31 periodontally healthy, 27 with gingivitis, and 31 with cp. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and  clinical attachment level were measured. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated qualitatively by conventional polymerase chain reaction. hbd-2 quantification in  saliva was performed using an immune enzymatic assay. frequency of periodontopathogens and hbd-2 protein concentration was assessed. association between hbd-2 protein concentration (>/=100 pg/ml) and the simultaneous presence  of one to two, three to four, or five to six periodontopathogens was tested. results: although periodontally healthy individuals and patients with gingivitis  showed similar hbd-2 levels, the cp group displayed an increased level of hbd-2.  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and t. denticola were more prevalent  in cp; however, their mere presence was not related to the increased levels of hbd-2 (pearson correlation and multinomial logistic regression model). conclusions: salivary hbd-2 protein concentration was higher in patients with cp  compared with healthy individuals or patients with gingivitis. these different protein concentrations were not related to the frequency of periodontopathogens.  clinical inflammatory profile had a higher impact on salivary hbd-2 levels than bacteria.

TI  == frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB  == objectives: this study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. design of study: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). results: the pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). except for p. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). the frequency of p.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). in periodontal samples, t. forsythia and t. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). the frequencies of c. rectus and t. forsythia  were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). the frequency of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). conclusions: bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. there was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.

AB  == background: the purpose of this single-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of boric acid irrigation as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) on clinical and microbiologic parameters and compare this method with chlorhexidine irrigation and srp alone in patients with  chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: forty-five systemically healthy patients with cp are included in this study. they were divided into three groups: 1) srp + saline irrigation (c); 2) srp + chlorhexidine irrigation (chx); and 3) srp + boric acid irrigation (b). to determine an ideal concentration of boric acid, a preclinical analysis was conducted. at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment, clinical measurements, including plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing (bop), were performed, and subgingival plaque samples were taken. quantitative analysis of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf), and treponema denticola (td) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) procedures. results: the concentration of boric acid is 0.75% in this study. all clinical parameters showed statistically significant reduction at all time points compared to baseline in all groups (p <0.001). whole-mouth pd and cal reduction was similar in all groups at all time points after treatment (p >0.05). the pd and cal reductions for moderately deep pockets (pd >/=5 and <7) were greater in the b group compared to other groups between baseline and 1 month (p <0.05). for deep pockets (pd >/=7), reductions were similar in the b and chx groups (p >0.05). bop (percentage) was significantly lower in the b group compared with the chx and c groups in the first month after treatment (p <0.001). gi and pi scores were significantly lower in the b and chx groups compared with the c group at all time points after treatment (p <0.05). the amounts of pg, tf,  and td were significantly reduced in all treatment groups after 1 month (p <0.05). no statistically significant differences were detected among the groups for microbiologic parameters at any time points after treatment (p >0.05). conclusions: the results of this study suggest that boric acid could be an alternative to chlorhexidine, and it might be more favorable because boric acid was superior in whole-mouth bop as well as pd and cal reduction for moderate pockets in early time periods.

TI  == cleavage of igg1 in gingival crevicular fluid is associated with the presence of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objectives: immunoglobulin (ig) g1 plays an important role in the  adaptive immune response. kgp, a lysine-specific cysteine protease from porphyromonas gingivalis, specifically hydrolyses igg1 heavy chains. the purpose  of this study was to examine whether cleavage of igg1 occurs in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in vivo, and whether there is any association with the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathogens. material and  methods: gcf was obtained from nine patients with aggressive periodontitis, nine  with chronic periodontitis and five periodontally healthy individuals. the bacterial loads of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella  forsythia were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the presence  and cleavage of igg1 and igg2 were determined using western blotting. kgp levels  were measured by elisa. results: cleaved igg1 was identified in the gcf from 67%  of patients with aggressive periodontitis and in 44% of patients with chronic periodontitis. by contrast, no cleaved igg1 was detectable in healthy controls. no degradation of igg2 was detected in any of the samples, regardless of health status. porphyromonas gingivalis was found in high numbers in all samples in which cleavage of igg1 was detected (p < 0.001 compared with samples with no igg  cleavage). furthermore, high numbers of tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were also present in these samples. the level of kgp in the gcf correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis (r = 0.425, p < 0.01). the presence of kgp (range 0.07-10.98 ng/ml) was associated with proteolytic fragments of igg1 (p < 0.001). however, cleaved igg1 was also detected in samples with no detectable kgp. conclusion: in patients with periodontitis, cleavage of igg1 occurs in vivo and may suppress antibody-dependent antibacterial activity in subgingival biofilms especially those colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == prediction of periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque of periodontal healthy subjects by measurement of volatile sulfur compounds in mouth air.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether measurements of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) are useful to predict colonization of periodontopathic bacteria. for this purpose, we assessed the relationships among  distributions of 4 species of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and dental plaque, oral conditions including vsc concentration in mouth air, and smoking habit of periodontal healthy young subjects. methods: the subjects were 108 young adults (mean age, 23.5+/-2.56 years) without clinical periodontal pockets. information regarding smoking habit was obtained by interview. after vsc concentration in mouth, air was measured with a portable sulfide monitor (halimeter((r))), non-stimulated saliva flow and dental caries status were assessed, and tongue coating and dental plaque samples were collected from the subjects. the tongue coating samples were weighed to determine the amount. the colonization of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in both tongue coating and plaque samples was investigated using species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. results: significant relationships were observed between the colonization of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and plaque samples, especially that of p. gingivalis. vsc concentration showed the most significant association with  colonization of p. gingivalis in both tongue coating and dental plaque. logistic  regression analysis demonstrated that the adjusted partial correlation coefficient [exp(b)] values for vsc concentration with the colonization of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola in dental plaque were 135, 35.4 and 10.4, respectively. in addition, smoking habit was also shown to be a significant variable in regression models [exp(b)=6.19, 8.92 and 2.53, respectively]. therefore, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict the colonization of periodontal bacteria in dental plaque in the subjects divided by smoking habit. based on our results, we found cut-off values that indicated likelihood ratios (lr) within the efficient range for positive findings in both groups. conclusion: the present results demonstrated that measurement of vsc concentration in mouth air is a useful method to predict the presence of colonization of some periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque.

AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == long-term follow-up of turned single implants placed in periodontally healthy patients after 16 to 22 years: microbiologic outcome.
AB  == background: survival rates in implant dentistry today are high, although late failures do occur for many reasons, including peri-implant infections. the primary objective of this study is to investigate microbiota around single turned implants after 16 to 22 years. secondary objectives are to compare teeth and implants and to correlate microbiologic, radiographic, and clinical parameters. methods: a total of 46 patients with single implants were invited for a clinical  examination. clinical data were collected from implants and contralateral natural teeth. radiographic bone level was measured around implants. microbiologic samples were taken from implants, contralateral teeth, and the deepest pocket per quadrant. samples were analyzed with dna-dna hybridization including 40 species.  statistical analysis was performed using wilcoxon signed-rank tests, mcnemar tests, and spearman correlation coefficients with a 0.05 significance level. results: mean follow-up was 18.5 years (range 16 to 22 years). tannerella forsythia (1.5 x 10(5)) and veillonella parvula (1.02 x 10(5)) showed the highest concentrations around implants and teeth, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and t. forsythia were significantly more present around implants than teeth. mean counts were significantly higher around implants than teeth for parvimonas micra, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and treponema denticola. total dna count was correlated to interproximal bleeding index (r = 0.409) and interproximal probing depth (r = 0.307). no correlations were present with plaque index or radiographic bone level. conclusions: in the present study, bacterial counts around single implants in periodontally healthy patients are rather low. although pathogenic bacteria are present, some in higher numbers around implants than teeth (five of 40), the majority of implants present with healthy peri-implant tissues without progressive bone loss.

AB  == backgroud and objective: genetic factors may influence the colonization of pathogenic bacteria, therefore increasing the risk for the initiation and development of periodontal disease. the present study was carried out to investigate the association of cd14-260 polymorphisms, subgingival microbiota, and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) cytokine levels with cyclosporine a (csa)-induced gingival overgrowth (go) in renal transplant patients. material and methods: a total of 204 patients were dichotomized into two groups: 124 with go and 80 without go. the cd14-260 polymorphisms were measured using an allele-specific pcr method. the levels of periodontal pathogens were determined by real-time pcr of subgingival samples. gcf levels of il-1beta and scd14 were detected by elisa. results: the frequency of cd14-260 genotype ct + tt was found  to be similar in both groups. patients with go presented increased prevalence of  pg, td, and tf (red complex) and significantly higher levels of interleukin -1beta than those without go. patients with go carrying ct + tt genotypes were found to have higher frequencies of pg, td, and tf than those carrying the cc genotype. furthermore, in the presence of red complex, ct + tt genotypes were associated with higher interleukin -1beta levels and severe go. multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the severity of go is not dependent on age, gender and pharmacological variables, being only associated with cd14-260 genotype and red complex periodontopathogens. conclusion: no association between  cd14-260 polymorphisms and the prevalence of go was revealed in renal transplant  patients administered csa. however, cd14-260 ct + tt genotypes are associated with the prevalence of red complex periodontopathogens in patients with go, and may thus play some role in the development of severe csa-induced go.

TI  == insights into the virulence of oral biofilms: discoveries from proteomics.
AB  == this review covers developments in the study of polymicrobial communities, biofilms and selected areas of host response relevant to dental plaque and related areas of oral biology. the emphasis is on recent studies in which proteomic methods, particularly those using mass spectrometry as a readout, have  played a major role in the investigation. the last 5-10 years have seen a transition of such methods from the periphery of oral biology to the mainstream,  as in other areas of biomedical science. for reasons of focus and space, the authors do not discuss biomarker studies relevant to improved diagnostics for oral health, as this literature is rather substantial in its own right and deserves a separate treatment. here, global gene regulation studies of plaque-component organisms, biofilm formation, multispecies interactions and host-microbe interactions are discussed. several aspects of proteomics methodology that are relevant to the studies of multispecies systems are commented upon.

TI  == differential proteomic analysis of a polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia exist in  a polymicrobial biofilm associated with chronic periodontitis. the aim of this study was to culture these three species as a polymicrobial biofilm and to determine proteins important for bacterial interactions. in a flow cell all three species attached and grew as a biofilm; however, after 90 h of culture p. gingivalis and t. denticola were closely associated and dominated the polymicrobial biofilm. for comparison, planktonic cultures of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were grown separately in continuous culture. whole cell lysates were subjected to sds-page, followed by in-gel proteolytic h(2)(1)(6)o/h(2)(1)(8)o labeling. from two replicates, 135 and 174 p. gingivalis proteins and 134 and 194 t. denticola proteins were quantified by lc-maldi tof/tof ms. the results suggest a change of strategy in iron acquisition by p. gingivalis due to large increases  in the abundance of husa and husb in the polymicrobial biofilm while hmuy and other iron/haem transport systems decreased. significant changes in the abundance of peptidases and enzymes involved in glutamate and glycine catabolism suggest syntrophy. these data indicate an intimate association between p. gingivalis and  t. denticola in a biofilm that may play a role in disease pathogenesis.

TI  == comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [lpss]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating lps contents with clinical/radiographic findings. in addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. methods: samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. the limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16s rdna) was used for bacterial investigation. results: endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 eu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively (p < .05). the median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly  higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (p < .05). prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). conclusions: teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum  ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of  which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.

TI  == effects of systemic sitafloxacin on periodontal infection control in elderly patients.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the microbiological and clinical effects of the systemic administration of sitafloxacin (stfx) on periodontal pockets in elderly patients  receiving supportive periodontal therapy (spt). background: periodontitis is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. better periodontal health contributes to reduce  atherosclerosis-related diseases in elderly population. materials and methods: forty-four patients undergoing spt were randomly assigned to two groups: a test group took 100 mg/day of stfx for five consecutive days, or a control group received scaling and root planing (srp) under local anaesthesia. microbiological  and clinical parameters were examined at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after therapy. results: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia was significantly reduced at 1 month after treatment in  both groups. the median reductions of the bacteria between the baseline and 1 month were 3.08 and 2.54% in the stfx- and srp-treated groups, respectively. both treatments significantly decreased the probing depth at 1 and 3 months compared to the baseline. conclusion: the systemic administration of stfx is effective at  improving periodontal health during spt and could be an alternative to srp for elderly patients who cannot undergo anaesthesia or are at risk of tissue injury.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

TI  == periodontal vaccine.
AB  == vaccine is the name applied generally to a substance of the nature of dead or attenuated living infectious material introduced into the body with the object of increasing its power to resist or get rid of a disease. vaccines are generally prophylactic, i.e. they ameliorate the effects of future infection. one such vaccine considered here is the "periodontal vaccine". till date, no preventive modality exists for periodontal disease and treatment rendered is palliative. thus, availability of periodontal vaccine would not only prevent and modulate periodontal disease, but also enhance the quality of life of people for whom periodontal treatment cannot be easily obtained. the aim of the research should be development of a multispecies vaccine targeting the four prime periodontal pathogens, viz. porphyromonas gingivalis, t. forsythus, t. denticola and a. comitans. success is still elusive in case of periodontal vaccine due to the complex etiopathogenesis of the disease.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == periodontal pathogens affect the level of protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == in periodontitis, an effective host-response is primarily related to neutrophils  loaded with serine proteases, including elastase (ne) and protease 3 (pr3), the extracellular activity of which is tightly controlled by endogenous inhibitors. in vitro these inhibitors are degraded by gingipains, cysteine proteases produced by porphyromonas gingivalis. the purpose of this study was to determine the level of selected protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in relation to periodontal infection. the gcf collected from 31 subjects (nine healthy controls, seven with gingivitis, five with aggressive periodontitis and 10 with chronic periodontitis) was analyzed for the levels of elafin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), two main tissue-derived inhibitors of neutrophil serine proteases. in parallel, activity of ne, pr3 and arginine-specific gingipains (rgps) in gcf was measured. finally loads of p. gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were determined. the highest values of elafin were found in aggressive  periodontitis and the lowest in controls. the quantity of elafin correlated positively with the load of p. gingivalis, ta. forsythia and tr. denticola, as well as with rgps activity. in addition, ne activity was positively associated with the counts of those bacterial species, but not with the amount of elafin. in contrast, the highest concentrations of slpi were found in periodontally healthy  subjects whereas amounts of this inhibitor were significantly decreased in patients infected with p. gingivalis. periodontopathogenic bacteria stimulate the release of ne and pr3, which activities escape the control through degradation of locally produced inhibitors (slpi and elafin) by host-derived and bacteria-derived proteases.

AB  == bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (bos) is a major cause of late graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. there is increasing evidence that beside alloimmunologic injury also non-alloimmunologic inflammatory conditions may raise the risk of acute and chronic rejection. the oral cavity represents a possible reservoir for pathogenic bacteria due to its close anatomical proximity. in this pilot study, the presence of pathogenic periodontal bacteria in the oral  cavity as well as in the lungs of lung transplant recipients was investigated for the first time. eight lung transplant recipients underwent broncho-alveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsies, and endobronchial biopsies. in addition to routinely performed examinations, pulmonary as well as plaque samples were assessed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and treponema denticola (td) with the aid of a hybridization technique. no or only one periodontal pathogen (solitarily pg) was found in the gingival plaques of five of the eight patients (group a). in three patients, two or more periodontal pathogens were detetectable in the gingival samples (group b). whereas group a also had not more than one periodontal pathogen in the lungs, group b had more than one species in the lungs. in group b, all patients suffered from bos, whereas in group a only one patient was affected. this is the first evidence for the presence of periodontal  pathogens in the lungs of lung transplant recipients. further studies with larger cohorts are required to elucidate potential links between periodontal infection,  pulmonary colonization, and rejection.

TI  == predominant bacterial species in subgingival plaque in dogs.
AB  == background and objective: the dog has been used extensively for experimental and  microbiological studies on periodontitis and peri-implantitis without detailed knowledge about the predominant flora of the subgingival plaque. this study was designed to evaluate the predominant cultivable bacterial species in dogs and compare them phenotypically and genotypically with corresponding human species. material and methods: four subgingival samples were taken from two upper premolars in each of six labrador retrievers. the samples from each dog were processed for anaerobic culture. from the samples of each dog, the five or six predominating bacteria based on colony morphology were selected and pure cultured. each of the strains was characterized by gram stain, anaerobic/aerobic  growth and api-zym test. eighteen strains showing clear-cut phenotypic differences were further classified based on dna sequencing technology. cross-reactions of dna probes from human and dog strains were also tested against a panel of both human and dog bacterial species. results: thirty-one strains in the dogs were isolated and characterized. they represented 21 different species,  of which six belonged to the genus porphyromonas. no species was found consistently in the predominant flora of all six dogs. porphyromonas crevioricanis and fusobacterium canifelinum were the two most prevalent species in predominant flora in dogs. dna probes from human and dog species cross-reacted to some extent with related strains from humans and dogs; however, distinct exceptions were found. conclusion: the predominant cultural subgingival flora in  dogs shows great similarities with the subgingival bacteria from humans at the genus level, but distinct differences at the species level; however, a genetic relatedness could be disclosed for most strains investigated.

TI  == [role of several periodontopathogenic microorganisms and tlr4 gene asp299gly polymorphism in atherosclerosis pathogenesis].
AB  == aim: establishment of presence of periodonto-pathogenic microorganisms in atherosclerosis plaque and surrounding tissues, and possible relation of development of atherosclerosis and tlr4 gene asp299gly polymorphism in ischemic heart disease patients (ihd). materials and methods: samples of coronary vessels  obtained during autopsy of 31 individuals deceased from ihd and 5 individuals deceased due to reasons not related with ihd were studied. pcr was used to determine dna of the microorganisms. tlr4 gene polymorphic segment was amplified  by using specific primers. results: analysis of coronary vessel atherosclerotic plaques revealed presence of the studied periodontopathogenic microorganisms in 83.9% of cases. the most frequently detected were porphyromonas gingivalis (64.5%), treponema denticola (41.9%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (32.3%), less frequently--bacteroides forsythus and prevotella intermedia (12.9%  and 6.5% respectively). in 51.6% of cases 2 or more microorganisms were detected. only in 11.1% ofcoronary artery samples, with plaques containing microorganisms,  the microorganisms were detected in undamaged tissues. patients deceased from ihd had tlr4 gene 299gly allele significantly more frequently. conclusion: the studied periodontopathogenic microorganisms can play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic injury of coronary arteries in ihd. the presence  of tlr4 gene allele 299gly significantly contributes to these processes.

TI  == symptomatic and asymptomatic apical periodontitis associated with red complex bacteria: clinical and microbiological evaluation.
AB  == in this study, the association of red complex (rc) bacteria that include treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis with acute, exacerbated or chronic apical periodontitis was evaluated. seventy-one patients with periapical disease were evaluated by clinical examination and microbiological samples obtained from the root canals were analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction assay. twenty-one (29.6%) samples were positive for rc  bacteria, with t. denticola, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis being detected in 14  (19.7%), 10 (14.1%) and 6 (8.5%) samples, respectively. rc bacteria were mainly associated with acute apical periodontitis (29.2%) and phoenix abscess (63.2%), while they were only sporadically detected (7.1%) in patients with chronic apical periodontitis. generally, rc bacteria were associated with pain and a higher frequency of intracanalar/intrasulcular pus drainage. involvement of rc bacteria  in symptomatic periapical disease should be suspected in the presence of particularly severe clinical pain and pus drainage.

TI  == animal models to study host-bacteria interactions involved in periodontitis.
AB  == animal models have distinct advantages because they can mimic cellular complexities that occur in humans in vivo and are often more accurate than in vitro studies that take place on plastic surfaces with limited numbers of cell types present. furthermore, cause and effect relationships can be established by  applying inhibitors or activators or through the use of genetically modified animals. such gain or loss of function studies are often difficult to achieve in  human clinical studies, particularly in obtaining target tissue due to important  ethical considerations. animal models in periodontal disease are particularly important at this point in the development of the scientific basis for understanding the predominant pathological processes. periodontal disease can be  broken down into discrete steps, each of which may be studied separately depending upon the animal model. these steps involve the development of a pathogenic biofilm, invasion of connective tissue by bacteria or their products,  induction of a destructive host response in connective tissue and limitation of are pair process that follows tissue breakdown. animal studies can test hypotheses related to each of these steps, and should be evaluated by their capacity to test a specific hypothesis rather than recapitulating all aspects of  periodontal disease. thus, each of the models described below can be adapted to test discrete components of the pathological process of periodontal disease, but  not necessarily all of them.

TI  == salivary levels of antibacterial peptide (ll-37/hcap-18) and cotinine in patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between salivary ll-37 levels and clinical severity in patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). the presence/absence of four periodontopathic bacteria and salivary cotinine levels were also examined to assess the impact of these factors on ll-37 production. methods: unstimulated salivary samples were collected from 69 patients with cp. salivary concentrations of ll-37 and cotinine were measured  by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in saliva were detected by polymerase chain reaction. periodontal examination included determination of probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, and plaque control record. results: mean salivary ll-37 concentration was 225.0 +/- 227.2 ng/ml, and a high prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was observed. the stepwise ordinal logistic regression model showed that high salivary ll-37 levels were significantly associated with the presence of t. denticola and higher percentage of teeth with pd >/=5 mm. in addition, higher salivary cotinine levels (>/=8 ng/ml) were negatively associated with salivary ll-37 levels. conclusions: salivary ll-37 level was positively correlated with severe periodontal destruction, and production was apparently associated with periodontopathic bacterial infection. the negative correlations between salivary  ll-37 and cotinine levels also suggest that smoking or long-term exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can lead to lower ll-37 levels in the oral cavity and increased risk of periodontitis.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. we also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by pcr invader technology. detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by pcr. fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. results: detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01). detection rate of f. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. a positive correlation was observed between dna quantification of p. gingivalis and number of candida species in saliva. cluster analysis of the test  species identified two clusters. tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque  status was associated with the detection rate of t. denticola and f. nucleatum. conclusion: results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by t. denticola and f. nucleatum.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

AB  == objective: to investigate the impact on microbiologic variables of full-mouth scaling (fms) and conventional scaling and root planing (csrp) after 12 months. method and materials: in a prospective randomized controlled clinical study, 37 volunteers with moderate chronic periodontitis were treated by fms or by csrp in  two sessions at 4-week intervals. clinical attachment level, probing depth, and bleeding on probing were recorded at baseline as well as at 6 and 12 months. four subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest sites in premolars and molars at baseline and after 12 months. pooled sample analysis was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction for the identification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, the bacterial load of a actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in the csrp group compared to the  fms group (p = .042). in the csrp group, this load decreased significantly (p = .011), leading to similar quantities of a actinomycetemcomitans in both groups. further, significant reductions in frequency were found in the fms group for t forsythia and p gingivalis and in the csrp group for a actinomycetemcomitans and  t denticola. conclusion: the data suggest that both therapy modalities lead to similar effects on target periodontal pathogen species. fms compared to csrp was  not favorable in reduction of periodontopathogens.

TI  == polymicrobial periodontal pathogen transcriptomes in calvarial bone and soft tissue.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia are consistently associated with adult periodontitis. this study sought to document the host transcriptome to a p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t.forsythia challenge as a polymicrobial infection using a murine calvarial model of acute inflammation and bone resorption. mice were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia over the calvaria, after which the soft tissues and calvarial bones were excised. a murine genechip((r)) array analysis of transcript profiles showed that 6997 genes were differentially expressed in calvarial bones  (p < 0.05) and 1544 genes were differentially transcribed in the inflamed tissues after the polymicrobial infection. of these genes, 4476 and 1035 genes in the infected bone and tissues were differentially expressed by upregulation. biological pathways significantly impacted by the polymicrobial infection in calvarial bone included leukocyte transendothelial migration (ltm), cell adhesion molecules, adherens junction, major histocompatibility complex antigen, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and antigen processing and presentation resulting in inflammatory/cytokine/chemokine transcripts stimulation in bone and soft tissue. intense inflammation and increased activated osteoclasts were observed in calvarias compared with sham-infected controls. quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis confirmed that the mrna level of selected genes corresponded with the microarray expression. the polymicrobial infection regulated several ltm and extracellular membrane pathway genes in a manner distinct from mono-infection with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia. to our knowledge, this is the first definition of the polymicrobially induced transcriptome in calvarial bone and soft tissue in response to periodontal pathogens.

TI  == synergistic virulence of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in a murine periodontitis model.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is characterized by the destruction of the tissues supporting the teeth and has been associated with the presence of a subgingival polymicrobial biofilm containing porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. we have investigated the potential synergistic virulence of p. gingivalis and t. denticola using a murine experimental model of periodontitis. an inoculation regime of four intra-oral doses of 1 x 10(10) p. gingivalis cells  induced significant periodontal bone loss compared with loss in sham-inoculated mice, whereas doses of 1 x 10(9) cells or lower did not induce bone loss. inoculation with t. denticola with up to eight doses of 1 x 10(10) cells failed to induce bone loss in this model. however, four doses of a co-inoculum of a 1 :  1 ratio of p. gingivalis and t. denticola at 5 x 10(8) or 1 x 10(9) total bacterial cells induced the same level of bone loss as four doses of 1 x 10(10) p. gingivalis cells. co-inoculation induced strong p. gingivalis-specific t-cell  proliferative and interferon-gamma-dominant cytokine responses, and induced a strong t. denticola-specific interferon-gamma dominant cytokine response. only at the higher co-inoculum dose of 1 x 10(10) total cells was a t. denticola-specific t-cell proliferative response observed. these data show that p. gingivalis and t. denticola act synergistically to stimulate the host immune response and to induce alveolar bone loss in a murine experimental periodontitis model.

TI  == effect of periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharides and proinflammatory cytokines on cd46, cd55, and cd59 gene/protein expression by oral epithelial cells.
AB  == membrane-anchored complement regulatory proteins (crps), including cd46, cd55, and cd59, protect host cells from complement attack. in the present study, we investigated whether periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines modulate crp gene/protein expression in human oral epithelial cells. the lipopolysaccharide of treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were the most potent for increasing the gene expression of cd55 and cd59, and to a lesser  extent cd46, after a 48-h stimulation. an lipopolysaccharide-induced upregulation of epithelial cell-surface crp was also demonstrated. the stimulation of epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide was associated with interleukin-6 (il-6) and il-8 secretion. although these two cytokines had no effect on cd46 and cd55 gene expression in epithelial cells, il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced a significant upregulation. the cell-surface expression of crp was also increased by the stimulation of epithelial cells with cytokines. the cd46, cd55,  and cd59 gene/protein expression was upregulated by periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines. it can be hypothesized that, when faced with bacterial challenges and inflammatory conditions associated with  active periodontal sites, oral epithelial cells may respond by increasing crp gene/protein expression to avoid cell lysis by the complement system, which is activated during periodontitis.

TI  == viral-bacterial associations in acute apical abscesses.
AB  == objective: viral-bacterial and bacterial synergism have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases. this study sought to investigate the possible associations between 9 candidate endodontic bacterial pathogens and 9 human viruses in samples from acute apical abscesses. study design: dna extracts from purulent exudate aspirates of 33 cases of acute apical  abscess were surveyed for the presence of 9 selected bacterial species using a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) approach. single or nested pcr assays were used for detection of the human papillomavirus (hpv) and herpesviruses types 1 to 8. results: two-thirds of the abscess samples  were positive for at least one of the target viruses. specifically, the most frequently detected viruses were hhv-8 (54.5%); hpv (9%); and varicella zoster virus (vzv), epstein-barr virus (ebv), and hhv-6 (6%). bacterial dna was present  in all cases and the most prevalent bacterial species were treponema denticola (70%), tannerella forsythia (67%), porphyromonas endodontalis (67%), dialister invisus (61%), and dialister pneumosintes (57.5%). hhv-8 was positively associated with 7 of the target bacterial species and hpv with 4, but all these associations were weak. several bacterial pairs showed a moderate positive association. viral coinfection was found in 6 abscess cases, but no significant viral association could be determined. conclusions: findings demonstrated that bacterial and viral dna occurred concomitantly in two-thirds of the samples from  endodontic abscesses. although this may suggest a role for viruses in the etiology of apical abscesses, the possibility also exists that the presence of viruses in abscess samples is merely a consequence of the bacterially induced disease process. further studies are necessary to clarify the role of these viral-bacterial interactions, if any, in the pathogenesis of acute apical abscesses.

AB  == aims: we investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. material and methods: twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. we recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants  at baseline, day 7, day 14 and day 21 (the "induction phase"), and at day 21, day 25, day 30 and day 35 in the other half (the "resolution phase"). rna was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using affymetrix human genome u133plus2.0 microarrays. paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: the median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at day 21 and 1 at day 35. differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. conclusions: transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of  the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental  gingivitis.

TI  == microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development in the absence of oral hygiene in periodontal health and disease.
AB  == aim: to monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. materials  and methods: supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28  teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: the total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. supragingival counts of veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. subgingival counts were greater  for actinomyces, green and orange complex species. significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0  at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. conclusions: supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked  in periodontitis.

TI  == oral health behaviors, periodontal disease, and pathogens in preeclampsia: a case-control study in korea.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to confirm the association among oral health behaviors, periodontitis, and preeclampsia in korean women. methods: this study is designed as a case-control study. sixteen women with preeclampsia and 48 without preeclampsia post-delivery were included in this study from november 2007 to january 2010. information was collected on demographics, health behaviors, and obstetric and systemic diseases that may influence the periodontal condition and  preeclampsia. full-mouth periodontal probing was conducted by one trained examiner (khb). localized periodontitis was defined as periodontal clinical attachment loss (al) >/= 3.5 mm on two or three sites not on the same tooth. in addition, generalized periodontitis was defined as clinical al >/= 3.5 mm on >/=  4 sites not on the same tooth. gingival crevicular fluid was collected using a sterilized paper point for quantitative analysis of treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia (pi), and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis). results: after adjusting for confounders, the adjusted odds ratio (or) was 4.79 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.02 to 29.72) for localized periodontitis and 6.60 (95% ci: 1.25 to 41.61) for generalized periodontitis. in addition, the proportion of floss or interdental brush users in women with preeclampsia was lower than that in women without (adjusted or: 0.21;  95% ci: 0.02 to 0.93). pi was significantly more prevalent in women with preeclampsia (p = 0.028). conclusion: these results indicate that preeclampsia could be associated with the maternal periodontal condition and interdental cleaning.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == myrsinoic acid b inhibits the production of hydrogen sulfide by periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == recently, we reported that myrsinoic acid b purified from myrsine seguinii inhibited methyl mercaptan (ch(3)sh) production by fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. since hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) is the main component of physiological halitosis, while ch(3)sh is involved in pathological oral halitosis, the objective of this study is to determine whether myrsinoic acid b inhibits h(2)s production by oral microorganisms. f. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were incubated with myrsinoic acid b and a substrate such as  l-cysteine or l-methionine. h(2)s or ch(3)sh concentration in the headspace air,  was determined using a gas chromatograph. the concentration of myrsinoic acid b inhibiting 50% (ic(50)) of h(2)s production by f. nucleatum was 0.142 microg ml(-1), and the ic(50) of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were 2.71 microg ml(-1)  and 28.9 microg ml(-1), respectively. the presence of pyruvate, a by-product of h(2)s production, was determined. the ic(50) values of myrsinoic acid b for pyruvate production were 22.9 microg ml(-1) for f. nucleatum, 87.7 microg ml(-1)  for p. gingivalis and 165 microg ml(-1) for t. denticola. we concluded that myrsinoic acid b inhibited the production of both h(2)s and pyruvate by periodontal pathogens.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == polymicrobial infection with periodontal pathogens specifically enhances microrna mir-146a in apoe-/- mice during experimental periodontal disease.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia are periodontal pathogens associated with the etiology of adult periodontitis as polymicrobial infections. recent studies demonstrated that oral infection with p. gingivalis induces both periodontal disease and atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic and proatherogenic apoe(-/-) mice. in this study, we explored the expression of micrornas (mirnas) in maxillas (periodontium) and spleens isolated from apoe(-/-) mice infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a polymicrobial infection. mirna expression levels, including mirna mir-146a, and associated mrna expression levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) were measured in the maxillas and spleens from mice infected with periodontal pathogens and compared to those in the maxillas and spleens from sham-infected controls. furthermore, in response to these periodontal pathogens (as mono- and polymicrobial heat-killed and live bacteria), human thp-1 monocytes demonstrated similar mirna expression patterns, including that of mir-146a, in vitro. strikingly, mir-146a had a negative correlation with tnf-alpha secretion in vitro, reducing levels of the adaptor kinases il-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (irak-1) and tnf receptor-associated factor 6 (traf6). thus, our studies revealed a persistent association of mir-146a expression with these periodontal pathogens, suggesting that mir-146a may directly or indirectly modulate or alter the chronic periodontal pathology induced by these microorganisms.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in japan.
AB  == background: smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. to clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. the aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of japanese patients with periodontitis. methods: sixty-seven japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in  the present study. they consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop) and oral hygiene status were recorded. detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, treponema denticola  and campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. association between the detection of periodontopathic  bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. results: a statistically significant association was found between having a ppd >/= 4 mm and detection of t. denticola, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, or c. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. a significant association was noted between bop and the detection of c. rectus or p. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. prevalence of c. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. conclusions: within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including c. rectus.

TI  == use of quantitative pcr to evaluate methods of bacteria sampling in periodontal patients.
AB  == periodontal disease is associated with specific periodontal pathogens and may persist as gingivitis or progress to more severe disease. the bacteria involved in disease initiation and progression have not been identified. we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to compare the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, and total bacteria detected by different sampling methods. on the basis of the results of clinical examinations, 57 patients were divided into 3 groups: healthy group (group a), gingivitis group (group b), and periodontitis group (group c). bacterial samples were collected from saliva, mouthwash, and by paper-point sampling of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and the samples were analyzed with quantitative pcr targeting 16s rrna. the numbers of total bacteria in samples of  gcf, saliva, and mouthwash were 10(5) to 10(6), 10(8), and 10(7), respectively, per milliliter. the number of p. gingivalis in gcf samples was lower than 10 in group a; however, in groups b and c, the values were 10(3) and 10(4), respectively, indicating that the number of p. gingivalis increased with worsening clinical status. findings were similar in the samples of saliva and mouthwash. the numbers of t. forsythia showed a pattern similar to that of p. gingivalis in all 3 samples. these results suggest that saliva and mouthwash samples are clinically useful for bacterial testing of periodontal diseases by quantitative pcr. in addition, mouthwash sampling is more feasible and straightforward than saliva sampling.

TI  == periodontal pathogens interfere with quorum-sensing-dependent virulence properties in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background and objective: the mechanism by which periodontal pathogens dominate at disease sites is not yet understood. one possibility is that these late colonizers antagonize the quorum-sensing systems of early colonizers and render those early colonizers less resistant to environmental factors. in this study, we utilized streptococcus mutans, a well-documented oral streptococcus with many quorum-sensing-dependent properties, as an example of an earlier colonizer antagonized by periodontal pathogens. material and methods: in this study, s. mutans ng8 and s. mutans lt11 were used in experiments assessing transformation,  and s. mutans bm71 was used in experiments investigating bacteriocin production.  the effects of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola on these competence-stimulating peptide-dependent properties were evaluated in mixed-broth assays. results: both p. gingivalis (either live bacteria or membrane vesicles) and t. denticola antagonized transformation in s.  mutans ng8 and lt11. the production of bacteriocin by s. mutans bm71 was also inhibited by p. gingivalis and t. denticola. boiling of these late colonizers before addition to the broth cultures abolished their ability to inhibit s. mutans transformation and bacteriocin production. p. gingivalis and t. denticola  inactivated s. mutans exogenous competence-stimulating peptide, whereas the boiled bacteria did not. conclusions: this study demonstrated that periodontal pathogens antagonize s. mutans quorum-sensing properties. this may render s. mutans less virulent and less resistant to environmental antibacterial factors.

TI  == early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health around zirconia and titanium  abutments: an in vivo study in man.
AB  == aim: to compare the early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health of mucosa adjacent to zirconia (zro(2)) and titanium (ti) abutment surfaces in vivo. materials and methods: twenty edentulous subjects received two endosseous mandibular implants. the implants were fitted with either a zro(2) or a ti abutment (non-submerged implant placement, within-subject comparison, left-right  randomization). sulcular bacterial sampling and the assessment of probing pocket  depth, recession and bleeding on probing were performed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. wilcoxon matched-pairs, sign-rank tests were applied to test differences in the counts of seven marker bacteria and the clinical parameters that were associated with the zro(2) and ti abutments, at the two observation time points. results: zro(2) and ti abutments harboured similar counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola at 2 weeks and 3 months. healthy clinical conditions were seen around both zro(2) and ti abutments at all times, without significant differences in most clinical parameters of peri-implant soft tissue health. mean probing depths around ti abutments were slightly deeper than around  zro(2) abutments after 3 months (2.2 sd 0.8 mm vs. 1.7 sd 0.7 mm, p=0.03). conclusions: no difference in health of the soft tissues adjacent to zro(2) and ti abutment surfaces or in early bacterial colonization could be demonstrated, although somewhat shallower probing depths were observed around zro(2) abutments  after 3 month.

TI  == periodontal parameters and bana test in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyze the periodontal parameters of patients with chronic renal failure. material and methods: the periodontal status of 16 brazilian patients aged 29 to 53 (41.7 +/- 7.2) years with chronic renal failure (crf) and another matched group of 14 healthy controls with periodontitis was assessed clinically and microbiologically. probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), dental plaque index (pli), gingival index (gi), and dental calculus index (ci) were the clinical parameters recorded for the entire dentition (at least 19 teeth), while the anaerobic periodontopathogen colonization in four sites with the highest ppd was evaluated using the bana test ("perioscan"; oral b). results: the results for the crf group and control group,  respectively were: ppd: 1.77 +/- 0.32 and 2.65 +/- 0.53; gr: 0.58 +/- 0.56 and 0.51 +/- 0.36; pli: 1.64 +/- 0.56 and 1.24 +/- 0.67; gi: 0.64 +/- 0.42 and 0.93 +/- 0.50; ci: 1.17 +/- 0.54 and 0.87 +/- 0.52. comparison between groups using the "t" test revealed a significantly increased ppd (p<0.001) in the control group. comparison of the other clinicial parameters by the mann-whitney test showed differences only for pli, which was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the crf group. spearman's test applied to each group showed a positive correlation among all clinical parameters, except for gr (p<0.05). none of the groups showed  any correlation between gr and gi, while a significant negative correlation between gr and ppd was observed for the crf group. the percentage of bana-positive sites was 35.9% for the crf group and 35.7% for the control group.  the bana test correlated positively with ppd only in the control group and with gr only in the crf group. conclusions: in spite of a higher pli and dense anaerobic microbial population even in shallow ppd, patients with crf exhibited better periodontal conditions than periodontitis patients, which is an evidence of altered response to local irritants.

TI  == efficacy and safety of adjunctive local moxifloxacin delivery in the treatment of periodontitis.
AB  == background: moxifloxacin exerts excellent antibacterial activity against most putative periodontal pathogens and has been shown to kill bacteria in biofilm and host cells. methods: patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to receive a single subgingival application of a 0.125%, 0.4%, or 1.25% moxifloxacin gel or placebo gel immediately after full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp). clinical efficacy measurements were assessed in sites with baseline probing depth (pd) of >/=5.4 mm at 6 weeks and 3 months and any adverse  events were determined. in addition, putative periodontal pathogens and resistance of subgingival bacteria against moxifloxacin were assessed. results: data of 57 patients were included in the statistical analysis. in all treatment groups, the pd decreased from baseline to 3 months, with the greatest reduction seen in patients treated with moxifloxacin 0.4% (1.5 +/- 0.6 mm; p = 0.023 compared to placebo), followed by patients receiving moxifloxacin 1.25% (1.2 +/-  0.4), moxifloxacin 0.125% (1.1 +/- 1.1), and placebo (1.0 +/- 0.6). no linear trend for pd reduction with increasing moxifloxacin concentrations was found. porphyromonas gingivalis showed the greatest reduction in prevalence among the assessed pathogens, without any significant intergroup differences. no correlation or systematic relationship between adverse events, including bacterial resistance against moxifloxacin, and the investigational gels was found. conclusions: in periodontal pockets with pd of >/=5.4 mm, a single subgingival administration of a 0.4% moxifloxacin gel as an adjunct to srp may result in additional pd reduction compared to srp alone. in addition, the investigated moxifloxacin gels seem to be safe.

TI  == effect of khat chewing on periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm from chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == aims: existing in vitro and in vivo data suggest that khat may have a favorable effect on periodontal microbiota. the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of khat chewing on major periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from subjects with chronic periodontitis. materials and methods: 40 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from periodontitis and healthy sites of  10 khat chewers (40 y median age) and 10 khat non-chewers (37.5 y median age) with chronic periodontitis. absolute and relative counts of 6 periodontal pathogens were determined in each sample using highly sensitive and specific taqman real-time pcr assays. data were analyzed using an ordinal regression model. results: significantly more total bacteria were detected in samples from the periodontitis sites of the khat chewers (or=20). treponema denticola was present at significantly higher absolute counts at the healthy as well as periodontitis sites of the khat chewers (or=3.13 and 13, respectively). however,  the khat chewers harbored significantly lower absolute counts of porphyromonas gingivalis at the healthy sites (or=0.07). furthermore, khat chewing was significantly associated with lower relative counts of porphyromonas gingivalis,  fusobacterium ssp., prevotella ssp. and parvimonas micra-like species in subgingival plaque samples from both healthy and periodontitis sites (or=0.11-0.33). only treponema denticola was found in higher relative counts at the healthy sites of the khat chewers (or=2.98). conclusions: overall, there was  a lower burden of pathogens in the khat chewers. findings from the current study  are suggestive of a potential prebiotic effect for khat on periodontal microbiota.

TI  == the ability of the bana test to detect different levels of p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the bana test to detect different levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella  forsythia or their combinations in subgingival samples at the initial diagnosis and after periodontal therapy. periodontal sites with probing depths between 5-7  mm and clinical attachment level between 5-10 mm, from 53 subjects with chronic periodontitis, were sampled in four periods: initial diagnosis (t0), immediately  (t1), 45 (t2) and 60 days (t3) after scaling and root planing. bana test and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization identified red complex species in the subgingival biofilm. in all experimental periods, the highest frequencies of score 2 (checkerboard dna-dna hybridization) for p. gingivalis, t. denticola and  t. forsythia were observed when strong enzymatic activity (bana) was present (p < 0.01). the best agreement was observed at initial diagnosis. the bana test sensitivity was 95.54% (t0), 65.18% (t1), 65.22% (t2) and 50.26% (t3). the specificity values were 12.24% (t0), 57.38% (t1), 46.27% (t2) and 53.48% (t3). the bana test is more effective for the detection of red complex pathogens when the bacterial levels are high, i.e. in the initial diagnosis of chronic periodontitis.

AB  == purpose: to characterize the normal bacterial flora and evaluate the presence of  periodontopathogenic bacteria around dental implants and to correlate them with the periodontal flora or, in completely edentulous patients, the alveolar gingival flora. materials and methods: clinical and radiographic parameters were  recorded to exclude peri-implantitis in 34 partially edentulous and 19 completely edentulous patients. partially edentulous patients were subdivided into two subgroups based on the depth of the periodontal pocket: </= 4 mm (n = 19) and > 4 mm (n = 15). microbial samples were collected from peri-implant sulci, the deepest periodontal sulci, and, for completely edentulous patients, from the alveolar gingiva. predominant aerobic bacteria were determined by microbiologic culturing, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect five periodontopathogenic bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: in all the examined patients, oral streptococci were the most frequent aerobic peri-implant bacteria. the frequency of four periodontopathogenic bacteria in tooth sulci (a actino?mycetemcomitans, p gingivalis, t forsythensis, t denticola) was significantly higher around natural  teeth with deeper periodontal pockets, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of the same bacteria in peri-implant sulci in the two partially edentulous subgroups. in contrast, there were no such bacteria in the peri-implant sulci or the alveolar gingiva of completely edentulous patients. conclusions: in healthy peri-implant sulci, oral streptococci constitute the predominant bacterial flora. in partially edentulous patients four periodontopathogenic bacteria were detected around implants, and none of these bacteria were found around implants in completely edentulous patients.

TI  == 16s rrna-based detection of oral pathogens in coronary atherosclerotic plaque.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis develops as a response of the vessel wall to injury.  chronic bacterial infections have been associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. the ability of oral pathogens to colonize in coronary atheromatous plaque is well known. aim: the aim of this study was to detect the presence of treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus in the subgingival and atherosclerotic plaques of patients with coronary artery disease. materials and methods: fifty-one patients  in the age group of 40-80 years with coronary artery disease were selected for the study. dna was extracted from the plaque samples. the specific primers for t. denticola, c. rectus and p. gingivalis were used to amplify a part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction. statistical analysis used: chi-square analysis, correlation coefficient and prevalence percentage of the microorganisms were carried out for the analysis. results: of the 51 patients, t. denticola, c.  rectus and p. gingivalis were detected in 49.01%, 21.51% and 45.10% of the atherosclerotic plaque samples. conclusions: our study revealed the presence of bacterial dna of the oral pathogenic microorganisms in coronary atherosclerotic plaques. the presence of the bacterial dna in the coronary atherosclerotic plaques in significant proportion may suggest the possible relationship between periodontal bacterial infection and genesis of coronary atherosclerosis.

TI  == periodontitis: a polymicrobial disruption of host homeostasis.
AB  == periodontitis, or gum disease, affects millions of people each year. although it  is associated with a defined microbial composition found on the surface of the tooth and tooth root, the contribution of bacteria to disease progression is poorly understood. commensal bacteria probably induce a protective response that  prevents the host from developing disease. however, several bacterial species found in plaque (the 'red-complex' bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) use various mechanisms to interfere with host  defence mechanisms. furthermore, disease may result from 'community-based' attack on the host. here, i describe the interaction of the host immune system with the  oral bacteria in healthy states and in diseased states.

TI  == the recolonization hypothesis in a full-mouth or multiple-session treatment protocol: a blinded, randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: to test recolonization of periodontal lesions after full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) or multiple session-srp (ms-srp) in a randomized clinical trial and whether fm-srp and ms-srp result in different clinical outcomes. materials and methods: thirty-nine subjects were randomly assigned to fm-srp or ms-srp groups. at baseline and after 3 months, probing pocket depth (ppd), plaque index (pli) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. at baseline, immediately after treatment, after 1, 2, 7, 14 and 90 days, paper point samples from a single site from the maxillary right quadrant were collected for microbiological analysis of five putative pathogens by polymerase chain reaction. results: fm-srp and ms-srp resulted in significant reductions in ppd, bop and pli and the overall detection frequencies of the five species after 3 months without significant differences between treatments. compared with ms-srp, fm-srp resulted in less recolonization of the five species, significantly for treponema denticola, in the tested sites. conclusion: fm-srp and ms-srp result in overall clinically and microbiologically comparable outcomes where recolonization of periodontal lesions may be better prevented by fm-srp.

TI  == roles of oral bacteria in cardiovascular diseases--from molecular mechanisms to clinical cases: implication of periodontal diseases in development of systemic diseases.
AB  == periodontal diseases, some of the most common infectious diseases seen in humans, are characterized by gingival inflammation, as well as loss of connective tissue  and bone from around the roots of the teeth, which leads to eventual tooth exfoliation. in the past decade, the association of periodontal diseases with the development of systemic diseases has received increasing attention. although a number of studies have presented evidence of close relationships between periodontal and systemic diseases, the majority of findings are limited to epidemiological studies, while the etiological details remain unclear. nevertheless, a variety of recent hypothesis driven investigations have compiled  various results showing that periodontal infection and subsequent direct oral-hematogenous spread of bacteria are implicated in the development of various systemic diseases. herein, we present current understanding in regard to the relationship between periodontal and systemic diseases, including cardiovascular  diseases, preterm delivery of low birth weight, diabetes mellitus, respiratory diseases, and osteoporosis.

TI  == mixture of periodontopathogenic bacteria influences interaction with kb cells.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to investigate the adhesion and invasion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in varied mixed infections and the release of interleukins from an epithelial cell line (kb cells). methods: kb cells were co-cultured with porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and m5-1-2, tannerella forsythia atcc 43037, treponema denticola atcc 35405 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 in single and mixed infections. the numbers of adherent and  internalized bacteria were determined up to 18 h after bacterial exposure. additionally, the mrna expression and concentrations of released interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 were measured. results: all periodontopathogenic bacteria adhered and internalized in different numbers to kb cells, but individually without any evidence of co-aggregation also to f. nucleatum. high levels of epithelial mrna of il-6 and il-8 were detectable after all bacterial challenges. after the mixed  infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 the highest levels of released interleukins were found. no il-6 and il-8 were detectable after the mixed infection of p. gingivalis m5-1-2 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 and the fourfold infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277, t. denticola atcc 35405, t. forsythia atcc 43037 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586. conclusion: anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria promote the release of il-6 and il-8 by epithelial  cells. despite a continuous epithelial expression of il-8 mrna by all bacterial infections these effects are temporary because of the time-dependent degradation  of cytokines by bacterial proteases. mixed infections have a stronger virulence potential than single bacteria. further research is necessary to evaluate the role of mixed infections and biofilms in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == full-mouth antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in fusobacterium nucleatum-infected periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to clinically and microbiologically evaluate the effect of photodynamic therapy (pdt) as a full-mouth procedure in fusobacterium nucleatum-infected patients with periodontitis. methods: in the present study, pdt is administered adjuvantly after scaling and root planing (srp) to patients with localized chronic periodontitis (lcp). twenty-four patients, in whom only f. nucleatum was detected by baseline polymerase chain reaction (pcr) after srp, were randomly assigned to pdt and control groups. pdt was carried out once as a full-mouth disinfection in the test group. the control  group was treated with the photosensitizer solution, but without laser irradiation. in all subjects, the clinical parameters plaque index, reddening, bleeding on probing (bop), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were determined at the baseline examination and at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after pdt. quantitative analysis of the f. nucleatum dna concentration was performed by competitive pcr. all clinical indices were calculated for each test and control subject as were the median and interquartile range of each group. results: in patients with lcp who received pdt treatment, significant reductions in reddening, bop, and mean pd and cal were observed during the observation period and with respect to controls. four and 12 weeks after pdt, the mean pd and cal showed significant differences from baseline values and from those of the control group. in the pdt group, 12 weeks after treatment, the f. nucleatum dna concentration was found to be significantly reduced compared to the baseline level. conclusion: the results of this study show that the adjuvant application of the described pdt method is appropriate to  reduce periodontal inflammatory symptoms and to successfully treat infection with f. nucleatum.

TI  == supernatants from oral epithelial cells and gingival fibroblasts modulate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter activation induced by periodontopathogens  in monocytes/macrophages.
AB  == bacterial and host cell products during coinfections of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-positive (hiv-1(+)) patients regulate hiv-1 recrudescence in latently infected cells (e.g. t cells, monocytes/macrophages), impacting highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) failure and progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. a high frequency of oral opportunistic infections (e.g. periodontitis) in hiv-1(+) patients has been demonstrated; however, their potential to impact hiv-1 exacerbation is unclear. we sought to determine the ability of supernatants derived from oral epithelial cells (okf4) and human gingival fibroblasts (gin-4) challenged with periodontal pathogens, to modulate the hiv-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages. bf24 monocytes/macrophages transfected with the hiv-1 promoter driving the expression  of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) were stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, or treponema denticola in the presence of supernatants from okf4 or gin4 cells either unstimulated or previously pulsed with bacteria. cat levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cytokine production was evaluated by luminex beadlyte assays. okf4 and gin4 supernatants enhanced hiv-1 promoter activation particularly related to f. nucleatum challenge. an additive effect was observed in hiv-1 promoter activation when monocytes/macrophages were simultaneously stimulated with gingival cell supernatants and bacterial extracts. okf4 cells produced higher levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) and interleukins -6 and -8 in response to f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. preincubation of okf4 supernatants with anti-gm-csf reduced the additive effect in periodontopathogen-induced hiv-1 promoter activation. these results suggest that  soluble mediators produced by gingival resident cells in response to periodontopathogens could contribute to hiv-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages, albeit this effect is most notable following direct stimulation of the cells with oral gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == synergistic effects of lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in an ex vivo whole blood model.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly associated with chronic periodontitis. this disease is characterized by  an accumulation of inflammatory cells in periodontal tissue and subgingival sites. the secretion of high levels of inflammatory cytokines by those cells is believed to contribute to periodontal tissue destruction. the aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory response of whole blood from periodontitis patients following challenges with whole cells of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia or their lipopolysaccharides (lps), individually and in combination. whole blood collected from seven periodontitis patients was stimulated with whole cells or lps and the production of interleukin (il)-1beta,  il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. the mono and mixed challenges with whole bacterial cells or lps induced the secretion of high amounts of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tnf-alpha by the mixed leukocyte population from periodontitis patients. in addition, p. gingivalis lps, t. denticola lps, and t. forsythia lps  acted in synergy to induce high levels of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. this study suggests that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia may contribute to the immunodestructive host response characteristic of periodontitis through synergistic effects of their lps on the inflammatory response induced by a mixed  population of leukocytes.

TI  == photodynamic therapy in periodontal therapy: microbiological observations from a  private practice.
AB  == in recent years, the combination of laser light and photosensitizer known as photodynamic therapy (pdt) has been used in periodontal therapy. however, there are not enough clinical studies to fully evaluate the effects of pdt on the periodontal tissues. this microbiological study examined the effects of pdt on the periodontal bacteria in combination with scaling and root planing (srp) in the same group of patients by randomly selecting pdt or srp for use in different  quadrants of the mouth. for the present study, pdt was compared with a diode laser (980 nm) and an nd:ya g laser (1,064 nm). microbiological samples were examined and evaluated over a period of three months. significant bacterial reduction has been observed in all cases. the diode laser with srp presented long-term positive results, while pdt showed a significant bacteria reduction during the entire observation period.

TI  == evaluating clinical periodontal measures as surrogates for bacterial exposure: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest).
AB  == background: epidemiologic studies of periodontal infection as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease often use clinical periodontal measures as a surrogate for the underlying bacterial exposure of interest. there are currently no methodological studies evaluating which clinical periodontal measures best reflect the levels of subgingival bacterial colonization in population-based settings. we investigated the characteristics of clinical periodontal definitions that were most representative of exposure to bacterial species that are believed  to be either markers, or themselves etiologic, of periodontal disease. methods: 706 men and women aged >or= 55 years, residing in northern manhattan were enrolled. using dna-dna checkerboard hybridization in subgingival biofilms, standardized values for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were averaged within mouth and summed to define "bacterial burden". correlations of bacterial burden with clinical periodontal constructs defined by the severity and extent of attachment loss (al), pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed. results: clinical periodontal constructs demonstrating the highest correlations with bacterial burden were: i) percent of sites with bop (r = 0.62); ii) percent of sites with pd >or= 3 mm (r = 0.61); and iii) number of sites with  bop (r = 0.59). increasing pd or al severity thresholds consistently attenuated correlations, i.e., the correlation of bacterial burden with the percent of sites with pd >or= 8 mm was only r = 0.16. conclusions: clinical exposure definitions of periodontal disease should incorporate relatively shallow pockets to best reflect whole mouth exposure to bacterial burden.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB  == introduction: chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. the aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then  examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific  bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. methods: during a  12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. results: no clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. in sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within  the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and t. denticola and t. forsythia (r = 0.43, p = 0.04). the odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusion: monitoring the proportions of p. gingivalis and t.  denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.

TI  == photodynamic therapy of persistent pockets in maintenance patients-a clinical study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the short-term performance of a session of single photodynamic therapy (pdt) and of a conventional ultrasonic debridement (ust) in persistent pockets of maintenance patients. in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical study, patients with chronic periodontitis with at least two persistent pockets (>4 mm) were enrolled. they were treated either with ust (n = 29) or pdt (n = 25). clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and after 3 months. for ust, the mean probing depth was reduced from 5.3 to 4.5 mm (p = <0.001) and for pdt from 5.3 to 4.7 mm (p < 0.001) with no difference between the two treatment modalities. microbial counts were significantly reduced about 30% to 40% immediately after debridement but returned to baseline values a 3 months irrespective of treatment. pdt is not superior to conventional mechanical treatment of persistent pockets, but it may be a meaningful therapeutic alternative; the clinical effects were too minor to draw a definitive conclusion.

AB  == background: one-stage full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) in combination with systemically administered azithromycin was shown to be clinically and bacteriologically effective in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. however, fm-srp requires 2 hours for completion. azithromycin has a long half-life. therefore, if srp of the full mouth is performed within 7 days while an effective concentration of azithromycin remains in the gingiva, the effects may be the same as fm-srp. the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and bacteriologic effects of fm-srp and partial-mouth scaling and root planing (pm-srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis, which was performed in three sessions within 7 days,  during the effective half-life of systemically administrated azithromycin. methods: thirty adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into three groups (fm-srp, pm-srp, and control). a clinical examination was conducted to record the probing depth, clinical attachment level gain, bleeding on probing, gingival index, and volume of gingival crevicular fluid; bacterial samples were obtained before treatment and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months thereafter.  quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed using the polymerase chain reaction-invader method. results: all clinical parameters showed better improvement in fm-srp and pm-srp groups compared to the control group, with no significant differences between the two test groups. periodontal bacteria were well controlled in the two test groups, but they tended to increase gradually 3 months after treatment in the control group. conclusion: pm- and fm-srp demonstrated comparable clinical and bacteriologic results.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == detection and quantification of five major periodontal pathogens by single copy gene-based real-time pcr.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic multibacterial infection in the tooth-supporting tissues. it has been shown that periodontitis patients carry higher number of disease-associated bacteria than healthy ones. the aim of this study was to generate a novel, single copy gene-based quantitative real-time pcr  (qpcr) assay for five major periodontal pathogens - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. the primer/probe sets were designed for conservative lipopolysaccharide-coding gene regions. they proved to be sensitive  and able to detect strains representing different serotypes of the target bacteria. the specificity of designed primers was tested using 49 selected bacterial species and no false positive or negative results were observed. we validated the assay with a case-control population, including 165 saliva samples, and proved the diagnostic accuracy by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. all quantified pathogens alone were able to distinguish significantly between the subjects with and without periodontitis, and provided areas under the roc curve larger than 0.5. the total pathogen burden comprising all five species  associated with periodontitis with an area of 0.821 (95% ci, 0.758-0.885, p50.001). our prominently sensitive and specific assay may have major importance  in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == comparison between polymerase chain reaction-based and checkerboard dna hybridization techniques for microbial assessment of subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == aim: to compare polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-ident test) and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and  3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: three hundred and fifty samples  were evaluated using both techniques. regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the pcr-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. the highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. conclusion: detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.

TI  == systemic immune responses in pregnancy and periodontitis: relationship to pregnancy outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study.
AB  == background: our previous studies reported on the obstetric, periodontal, and microbiologic outcomes of women participating in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study. this article describes the systemic antibody responses to selected periodontal bacteria in the same patients. methods: serum samples, obtained from pregnant women at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation) and 29 to 32 weeks, were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, women who delivered live preterm infants had significantly  lower total serum levels of igg antibody to the panel of periodontal pathogens (p = 0.0018), to p. gingivalis (p = 0.0013), and to f. nucleatum (p = 0.0200) than women who delivered at term. these differences were not significant at 29 to 32 weeks. changes in igg levels between baseline and 29 to 32 weeks were not associated with preterm birth when adjusted for treatment group, clinical center, race, or age. in addition, delivery of low birth weight infants was not associated with levels of antibody at baseline or with antibody changes during pregnancy. conclusions: live preterm birth is associated with decreased levels of igg antibody to periodontal pathogens in women with periodontitis when assessed during the second trimester. changes in igg antibody during pregnancy are not associated with birth outcomes.

TI  == probiotic effects of orally administered lactobacillus salivarius wb21-containing tablets on periodontopathic bacteria: a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: this study was designed to evaluate whether the oral administration of lactobacilli could change the bacterial population in supra/subgingival plaque. material and methods: sixty-six healthy volunteers without severe periodontitis were randomized into two groups to receive lactobacilli or placebo for 8 weeks (8w): the test group (n=34) received 2.01 x 10(9) cfu/day of lactobacillus salivarius wb21 and xylitol in tablets; the control group (n=32) received placebo with xylitol. supra/subgingival plaque samples were collected at the baseline and after 4 weeks (4w) and 8w. the bacterial amounts in plaque samples were analysed  by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria in the test group was decreased significantly in subgingival plaque at 4w [odds ratio (or)=3.13, 95% confidence intervals (ci)=1.28-7.65, p=0.012]. multivariate analysis showed that significantly higher odds were obtained for the reduction of tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque of the test group at both 4w (or=6.69, 95% ci=2.51-17.9, p<0.001) and 8w (or=3.67, 95% ci=1.45-9.26, p=0.006). conclusion: oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli reduced the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria and could contribute to the beneficial effects on periodontal conditions.

TI  == microbial changes in periodontitis successfully treated by mechanical plaque removal and systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole.
AB  == scaling and root planing in conjunction with systemic administration of antibiotics is used for treatment of aggressive periodontitis. the study investigated the changes of the subgingival microbiota in a homogeneous cohort of 12 female caucasian patients. plaque samples were obtained from 4 defined deep lesions per patient at baseline and 2, 6, and 12 months after therapy (mechanical plaque removal, oral administration of amoxicillin and metronidazole). amplification of the 16s rrna gene, cloning, and sequencing were applied to identify microbial species. porphyromonas gingivalis strains were typed by multilocus sequence typing. despite of a favorable clinical outcome, 16s rrna sequence analysis revealed only minor changes of the microbiota with a temporal reduction of p. gingivalis and of treponema denticola-like phylotypes. in contrast to t. denticola, t. sokranskii-like phylotypes were not affected. in 4 patients with recurrent colonization by p. gingivalis, the bacterial clones were  identical before and after therapy as evidenced by multilocus sequence typing suggesting clonal persistence or reinfection during the course of the study. in summary, despite a favorable clinical outcome, a transient effect on only few bacterial species was observed.

TI  == bacteria in the apical root canal of teeth with primary apical periodontitis.
AB  == objective: bacteria settled in the apical root canal are in a privileged position to inflict damage to the periradicular tissues. therefore, the species identified in this region can be of special relevance for the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. this study investigated the occurrence and levels of several bacterial taxa in the apical root canal of teeth with apical periodontitis. study design: dna extracts from samples taken from the apical part of the root canal of extracted teeth evincing chronic apical periodontitis lesions served as templates for analysis of the presence and levels of 28 bacterial species/phylotypes using  a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay.  results: bacterial dna was detected in 19 out of 20 samples. detected taxa included pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (32%), bacteroidetes clone x083 (26%), streptococcus species (21%), olsenella uli (10.5%), synergistes clone ba121 (10.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10.5%), porphyromonas endodontalis (10.5%), dialister clone bs016 (5%), filifactor alocis (5%), parvimonas micra (5%), and treponema denticola (5%). of these, only bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121 were found at levels above 10(5). conclusion: occurrence of these bacterial taxa in the apical part of infected root canals indicates their potential pathogenetic role in the etiology of apical periodontitis.

TI  == role of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione catabolism.
AB  == introduction: our previous studies demonstrated that three enzymes, gamma-glutamyltransferase (ggt), cysteinylglycinase (cgase) and cystalysin, are required for the catabolism of glutathione to produce hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) in treponema denticola. in this study, we examined glutathione catabolism in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. methods: the ggt and cgase of a. actinomycetemcomitans were determined by biological methods and ggt was characterized using a molecular biological approach. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans showed ggt and cgase activity, but could not produce h(2)s  from glutathione. the addition of recombinant t. denticola cystalysin, an l-cysteine desulfhydrase, to whole cells of a. actinomycetemcomitans resulted in  the production of h(2)s from glutathione. subsequently, we cloned a. actinomycetemcomitans ggt gene (ggt) and overexpressed the 63 kda ggt protein. the recombinant a. actinomycetemcomitans ggt was purified and identified. the k(cat)/k(m) of the recombinant ggt from n-gamma-l-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline as substrate was 31/microm/min. the activity of ggt was optimum at ph 6.9-7.1 and enhanced by thiol-containing compounds. conclusion: the results demonstrated that a. actinomycetemcomitans had ggt and cgase activities and that the ggt was characterized. the possible role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione metabolism and h(2)s production from oral bacteria was discussed.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == red bacterial complex is associated with the severity of chronic periodontitis in a thai population.
AB  == background: the distribution of periodontal pathogens differs in various geographic locations and racial/ethnic groups. this study investigated the microbiological features of chronic periodontitis (cp) patients in thailand. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 20 non-periodontitis subjects, 20 patients with mild cp, and 20 patients with moderate to severe cp were examined using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to identify porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. results: in the moderate to severe cp patients, there was  high prevalence of p. gingivalis (95%), t. forsythia (95%), t. denticola (80%), as well as the red complex (coexistence of all three species at the same lesion)  (75%). a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only 35% of the patients in this  study group. p. gingivalis was detected in as high as 45% of the non-periodontitis controls. cp and disease severity were significantly related to the presence of t. forsythia together with t. denticola and the red complex. the  red complex was not found in any non-periodontitis site. conclusion: red complex  bacteria were predominant periodontal pathogens of the moderate to severe form of cp in this thai population. the presence of t. forsythia together with t. denticola, and the red complex species at the same site were significantly associated with the disease severity.

TI  == identification of pathogen and host-response markers correlated with periodontal  disease.
AB  == background: periodontitis is the major cause of tooth loss in adults and is linked to systemic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and stroke. the development of rapid point-of-care (poc) chairside diagnostics has the potential  for the early detection of periodontal infection and progression to identify incipient disease and reduce health care costs. however, validation of effective  diagnostics requires the identification and verification of biomarkers correlated with disease progression. this clinical study sought to determine the ability of  putative host- and microbially derived biomarkers to identify periodontal disease status from whole saliva and plaque biofilm. methods: one hundred human subjects  were equally recruited into a healthy/gingivitis group or a periodontitis population. whole saliva was collected from all subjects and analyzed using antibody arrays to measure the levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and bone resorptive/turnover markers. results: salivary biomarker data were correlated to comprehensive clinical, radiographic, and microbial plaque biofilm  levels measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) for the generation of models for periodontal disease identification. significantly elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-8 and -9 were found in subjects with advanced periodontitis with random forest importance scores of 7.1 and 5.1,  respectively. the generation of receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated that permutations of salivary biomarkers and pathogen biofilm values augmented the prediction of disease category. multiple combinations of salivary biomarkers (especially mmp-8 and -9 and osteoprotegerin) combined with red-complex anaerobic periodontal pathogens (such as porphyromonas gingivalis or  treponema denticola) provided highly accurate predictions of periodontal disease  category. elevated salivary mmp-8 and t. denticola biofilm levels displayed robust combinatorial characteristics in predicting periodontal disease severity (area under the curve = 0.88; odds ratio = 24.6; 95% confidence interval: 5.2 to  116.5). conclusions: using qpcr and sensitive immunoassays, we identified host- and bacterially derived biomarkers correlated with periodontal disease. this approach offers significant potential for the discovery of biomarker signatures useful in the development of rapid poc chairside diagnostics for oral and systemic diseases. studies are ongoing to apply this approach to the longitudinal predictions of disease activity.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and the hla-dqb1 allele are associated with susceptibility to periodontal disease in japanese adolescents.
AB  == periodontal disease is a multiple factor disease caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and periodontal bacteria (periodontal pathogens). the present study aimed to elucidate the risk factors for periodontal disease in japanese adolescents. subjects (11-16 years old) were classified into three groups: localized aggressive periodontitis (lap), periodontal attachment loss (pal), and periodontally healthy (ph) groups. genomic dna isolated from the buccal mucosa was used for single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the candidate genes (interleukin-1alpha-889; interleukin-1alpha +4845; interleukin-1beta +3954; an immunoglobulin g fc gamma receptor, fcgammariia-r/h131; and a human leukocyte antigen class ii allele, hla-dqb1) of aggressive periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples obtained from the same subjects were used for 16s rrnabased polymerase chain reaction analysis of five important periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). tannerella forsythia was detected in the deepest periodontal pockets in all subjects in the lap and pal groups. the prevalence of  an atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 of the lap group was significantly higher than that in the ph and pal groups. furthermore, all subjects who had the  atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 had t. forsythia infection. these results suggested that t. forsythia is associated with periodontal disease in japanese adolescents and also suggested that hla-dqb1 is related to lap and is associated with t. forsythia infection.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis with either tannerella forsythia or treponema denticola  induces synergistic il-6 production by murine macrophage-like j774.1 cells.
AB  == background: chronic periodontitis is caused by mixed bacterial infection. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola are frequently detected in deep periodontal pockets. we demonstrate that these bacteria induce proinflammatory cytokine production by the mouse macrophage-like  cell line j774.1. materials and methods: j774.1 cells were incubated with and without bacteria for 24h in 96-well flat-bottomed plates. the culture supernatants were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for secreted mouse interleukin (il)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, il-23, il-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. the cytokine concentrations were determined using a standard curve prepared for each assay. results: mixed infection with p.  gingivalis and either t. forsythia or t. denticola at 10(5)cfu/ml acted synergistically to increase il-6 production, but not monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, il-23, il-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. gingipain  inhibitors kyt-1 and kyt-36 inhibited il-6 production by j774.1 cells incubated with 10(5)cfu/ml of mixed bacteria. conclusion: these results suggest that p. gingivalis with either t. forsythia or t. denticola directly induces synergistic  il-6 protein production and that gingipains play a role in this synergistic effect.

TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == detection of oral bacteria in cardiovascular specimens.
AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == differences in subgingival microflora of korean and german periodontal patients.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to characterize the microbiological profile in samples of subgingival plaque taken from periodontal patients with different ethnic origin. methods: 178 patients (n=90 from south korea and n=88 from germany; age: 45.4 +/- 10.4 years) were diagnosed with severe generalized periodontitis. in all patients the deepest pocket of each quadrant was sampled for subgingival plaque. the four samples per patient were pooled and subsequently analysed with a 16s-rna-gene probe test. results: prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in german patients (47.7%) compared to korean patients (26.7%) (p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). for tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis, differences between germans and koreans were not as pronounced. a statistically significant difference could also be found for treponema denticola (germans: 95.5%, koreans: 81.1%, p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). after logarithmic transformation, bacterial counts differed for all microorganisms under investigation between germans and koreans, even after using  a general linear model/analysis of covariance (glm/ancova) to adjust for gender,  age, smoking status, pocket probing depths (ppd) of sampled teeth, and gingival bleeding index (gbi). conclusion: depending on their ethnic origin, the microbiological profile of pooled subgingival plaque sample seems to differ significantly between patients of caucasian and asian ethnic origin.

TI  == persistence of extracrevicular bacterial reservoirs after treatment of aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis persist in extracrevicular locations following scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotics, and antimicrobial rinses. methods: eighteen patients with aggressive periodontitis received a clinical examination during which samples of subgingival plaque and buccal epithelial cells were obtained. treatment consisted of full-mouth root planing, systemic antibiotics, and chlorhexidine rinses. clinical measurements and sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined the number of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola in the plaque. fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy determined the extent of intracellular invasion in epithelial cells. results: clinical measurements improved significantly following treatment. all bacterial species except p. gingivalis were significantly reduced in plaque between baseline and 3 months. however, all species showed a trend to repopulate  between 3 and 6 months. this increase was statistically significant for log t. denticola counts. all species were detected intracellularly. the percentage of cells infected intracellularly was not affected by therapy. conclusions: the 6-month increasing trend in the levels of plaque bacteria suggests that subgingival recolonization was occurring. because the presence of these species within epithelial cells was not altered after treatment, it is plausible that recolonization may occur from the oral mucosa. systemic antibiotics and topical chlorhexidine did not reduce the percentage of invaded epithelial cells. these data support the hypothesis that extracrevicular reservoirs of bacteria exist, which might contribute to recurrent or refractory disease in some patients.

AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm of subjects with healthy and diseased implants.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to compare the microbial composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm in subjects with and without peri-implantitis. material and methods: forty-four subjects (mean age 48.9 +/- 13.51 years) with at least one implant restored and functional for at least 2 years were assigned to two groups: a peri-implantitis group (n=22), consisting of subjects presenting peri-implant sites with radiographic defects >3 mm, bleeding on probing and/or suppuration; and a control group (n=22), consisting of subjects with healthy implants. the clinical parameters evaluated were plaque index, gingival bleeding, bleeding on probing, suppuration, probing depth and clinical attachment level. supra- and subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of each  implant and analyzed for the presence of 36 microorganisms by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were observed in the peri-implantitis group, both supra- and subgingivally (p<0.05). the proportions of the pathogens from the red complex were elevated, while host-compatible beneficial microbial complexes were reduced in diseased compared with healthy implants. the microbiological profiles of supra- and subgingival environments did not differ substantially within each group. conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the microbiota associated with peri-implantitis was comprised  of more periodontal pathogenic bacterial species, including the supragingival biofilm.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == treatment outcomes of dental flossing in twins: molecular analysis of the interproximal microflora.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

TI  == third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == relationship of porphyromonas gingivalis with glycemic level in patients with type 2 diabetes following periodontal treatment.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum  glycemic levels and subgingival microbial profile alteration following periodontal treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. methods: we studied 30 periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received full-mouth subgingival debridement by analyzing their subgingival microbial profiles using a polymerase chain reaction method at baseline and various time-points for 12 months following treatment. concurrently, probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and metabolic parameters, including glycated hemoglobin a1c (hba1c), blood sugar level, c-reactive proteins, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, were recorded. results: periodontal conditions were significantly improved after treatment, and the occurrence rates of periodontal bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia, were also reduced. interestingly, p. gingivalis was detected more frequently in subjects with increased hba1c values after periodontal treatment than in those patients with decreased hba1c values. furthermore, p. gingivalis with type ii fimbriae was detected only in hba1c-increased subjects, while improvements in hba1c values were observed only in subjects without type ii clones. conclusions: these results suggest that glycemic level in diabetes is affected by the persistence of p. gingivalis, especially clones with type ii fimbriae, in periodontal pockets.

TI  == analysis of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid suggests importance of cathelicidin ll-37 in the innate immune response against periodontogenic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: during periodontitis, an innate immune response to bacterial challenge is primarily mediated by neutrophils. we compared neutrophilic content  and the level of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in two clinical forms of severe periodontitis. methods: gcf was collected from 14 patients with aggressive periodontitis, 17 patients with chronic periodontitis, and nine healthy subjects. samples were analyzed for periodontopathogen load using real-time polymerase chain reactions. the amounts of myeloperoxidase and alpha-defensins (hnp1-3) were determined by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay, and the level of cathelicidin (hcap18/ll-37) was assayed by  western blot. results: myeloperoxidase concentration was not correlated with levels of ll-37 and hnp1-3 in samples from patients, compared to controls. the amount of hnp1-3 was twofold and fourfold higher in patients with aggressive and  chronic periodontitis, respectively. those with chronic disease had significantly elevated amounts of mature ll-37. the increased concentration of both peptides in chronic periodontitis correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. conclusion: the lack of a correlation between ll-37, hnp1-3, and myeloperoxidase content suggests that neutrophils are not the sole source of these bactericidal peptides in the gcf of  patients with periodontitis; and that other cells contribute to their local production. the bacterial proteases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola might degrade hcap18/ll-37, because the 11-kda cathelicidin-derived fragment was present in gcf collected from pockets infected with these bacteria.  collectively, it appears that a local deficiency in ll-37 can be considered as a  supporting factor in the pathogenesis of severe cases of periodontitis.

TI  == an update on periodontal aetiopathogenesis and clinical implications.
AB  == periodontal disease is the most commonly occurring yet unusual infection in humans. it is initiated by pathogenic plaque biofilm and characterized by bacteria-induced inflammatory destruction of tooth-supporting structures and alveolar bone. periodontitis remains the most common cause of tooth loss in adults. currently, periodontal diseases are also recognized as serious infections with profound effects on general health. in recent years, new concepts and discoveries have been made in further understanding of the nature of periodontal  disease and its aetiopathogenesis. these can be well reflected in recognition of  dental plaque as a biofilm; identification and characterization of periodontopathogens and their virulence factors; recognition of the importance of host-microbe symbiosis in periodontal health; identification of novel innate host defence molecules in periodontal tissues; further understanding of the molecular  mechanisms involved in tissue destruction and alveolar bone resorption; appreciation of the crucial role of host susceptibility in periodontal pathogenesis; and identification of risk factors and incorporation of risk assessment in clinical practice. committed oral health care professionals should  therefore keep abreast of these changing concepts in periodontology and updated strategies for appropriate evidence-based practice. these views are fundamentally important for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of periodontal diseases and peri-implant infections, as well as for long-term maintenance of periodontal health and implant stability. this paper updates the advances in aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease and highlights the relevant clinical implications and future perspectives.

TI  == assessment of the microbiota in root canals of human primary teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the prevalence of microorganisms in root canals of human primary teeth, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. methods: fifty-five root canals of primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis (group 1) and 51 root canals of teeth with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis (group 2) were selected. microbiological samples were collected and submitted to checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using 34 genomic dna probes. the  results were analyzed statistically by mann-whitney u-test at a 5% significance level. results: the most prevalent species in group 1 were: (1) campylobacter rectus (87%); (2) gemella morbilorum (78%); (3) streptococcus gordonii (71%); (4) capnocytophaga ochracea (69%); (5) treponema denticola (58%); and (6) streptococcus intermedius (49%). the most prevalent species in group 2 were: (1)  c. rectus (90%); (2) t. denticola (88%); (3) s. intermedius (77%); (4) g. morbilorum (73%); (5) streptococcus oralis (67%); (6) c. ochracea (63%); (7) s. gordonii (55%); (8) streptococcus mitis (51%); and (9) leptotrichia buccalis (51%). except for peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii, the most prevalent bacterial strains in the root canals with apical periodontitis were also those found in larger numbers (p<.05). groups 1 and 2 differed significantly (p<.05) regarding the total number of bacterial cells detected in the root canal  samples, with group 2 showing remarkably larger bacterial cell numbers. conclusions: root canals of primary teeth have a great bacterial diversity, characterizing a polymicrobial endodontic infection with presence of: (1) anaerobic and facultative micro organisms; (2) black-pigmented rods; and (3) streptococci. a large number of anaerobic species were detected in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, and a significantly smaller number of bacterial cells were found in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.

TI  == occurrence of herpes simplex virus 1 and three periodontal bacteria in patients with chronic periodontitis and necrotic pulp.
AB  == viral and bacterial associations appear to be implicated in the development of periodontal infections. little information is available describing the periodontopathic agents in root canals with necrotic pulp. in this study, the occurrence and the combinations among herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) and dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in patients with chronic periodontitis and necrotic pulp were evaluated. clinical samples from healthy subjects and patients with periodontal or pulp infections were analyzed using a nested polymerase chain reaction pcr to detect hsv and pcr to detect the 3 periodontal bacteria. the presence of tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola was observed in healthy, periodontitis, and necrotic pulp patients. hsv was observed in periodontitis and necrotic pulp patients, and no healthy subject harbored d. pneumosintes or hsv. the occurrence of tannerella forsythia was not statistically significant in patients with necrotic pulp (p = 0.704). periodontal bacteria were observed varying from 10.3% to 20.7% in periodontitis and necrotic pulp patients. the presence of treponema denticola - hsv association was predominant in patients showing necrotic pulp (24.1%); however, hsv alone was observed in one patient with periodontitis and in another  patient with necrotic pulp. the presence of double association among bacteria or  bacteria - hsv could indicate a role in both periodontitis and necrotic pulp, and tannerella forsythia - treponema denticola - hsv and tannerella forsythia - d. pneumosintes - treponema denticola - hsv associations might be important in periodontitis.

TI  == the reproducibility of curet sampling of subgingival biofilms.
AB  == background: because few studies have examined the critical issue of sampling reproducibility, the purpose of the present study was to examine the reproducibility of curet sampling of subgingival biofilms. methods: seven subgingival biofilm samples were taken successively, using a curet, from each of  80 sites and individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. one healthy site was sampled in each of 20 periodontally healthy subjects, and one sulcus/pocket of < or =3, 4 to 5, and  > or =6 mm was sampled in each of 20 subjects with chronic periodontitis. the significance of differences in counts and proportions of individual species at the seven successive samplings for each probing depth (pd) category was determined using the kruskal-wallis test. the reproducibility of species proportions at each pd category was measured using the coefficient of variation (cv), and the consistency of microbial profiles across samples was examined using the minimum similarity coefficient. results: there was no significant difference  in the mean proportions of the 40 test species in the seven successive samples in each of the four pd categories. the median cv for individual species in the same  site was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.76 to 0.82) compared to 1.76 (95%  ci: 1.69 to 1.82) in samples from different sites. the within-site mean minimum similarity coefficient (+/- sem) was 51.2% +/- 2.2%, and it was 27.9% +/- 0.3% between sites. conclusion: the proportions of species remained consistent in successive curet samples, indicating that the use of curets provided a reliable and reproducible method to obtain subgingival samples.

TI  == microbiologic and immunologic characteristics of periodontal disease in hispanic  americans with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: the microbiology of periodontitis in type 1 diabetes has been reported, but less is known about type 2 diabetes. moreover, these data have not  linked microbial colonization, host response, and clinical presentation in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. the objectives of this study were to relate periodontal status, periodontal microorganisms, and host-response characteristics in hispanic americans with type 2 diabetes. methods: plaque and serum samples were obtained from 63 hispanic american subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. the microbiology of subgingival plaque samples was evaluated using dna checkerboard hybridization, and serum antibody to a battery of oral microorganisms was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: in general, similar pathogens were present in periodontitis sites from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, although the periodontitis sites in diabetes showed a higher frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and campylobacter spp. serum antibody to campylobacter rectus was elevated in type 2  diabetes, whereas antibody to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were elevated in subjects with periodontitis, irrespective of diabetes status. stratification of the population based upon antibody to p. gingivalis or c. rectus suggested a linkage between elevated antibody to p. gingivalis, increased frequency of diabetes, and significantly worse periodontitis. conclusion: the increased severity of periodontal disease with type 2 diabetes may reflect an alteration of the pathogenic potential of periodontal bacteria and/or a modification of the characteristics of the host's inflammatory response that may contribute to a breakdown in the homeostasis of the periodontium.

TI  == increased interleukin-18 in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients.
AB  == introduction: this study aimed to measure the levels of interleukin-18 (il-18) in inflamed shallow sites and inflamed deep sites in patients with periodontitis and to compare the data with results from inflamed shallow sites in patients with gingivitis. a secondary aim was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in the sampled sites. methods: gingival crevicular fluid was collected from five gingivitis sites and five periodontitis sites from 18 patients with chronic periodontitis, and from five gingivitis sites from 15 patients with gingivitis. samples from each site category were pooled and il-18 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the subgingival microbiota was analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid volumes were higher in periodontitis sites compared with gingivitis sites from patients with periodontitis and gingivitis. the total amount of il-18 was higher in periodontitis sites than gingivitis sites in both periodontitis (p = 0.018) and gingivitis (p = 0.002) patients and was higher in gingivitis sites from periodontitis patients than in those from gingivitis patients (p = 0.015). there were higher levels of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola (red complex species) in periodontitis sites compared with gingivitis sites in both the periodontitis and gingivitis patients (p < 0.001). conclusion: levels of il-18 were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis, even at sites with similar pocket depths. the presence of similar levels of red complex species in gingivitis sites from periodontitis patients and from gingivitis patients suggested that the higher levels of il-18 were not associated with a different microbial challenge.

AB  == objective: dental calculus is considered to be simply a "plaque-retentive factor", and therefore only a secondary aetiological factor in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. recent studies have suggested a more active role for calculus.  our objective was to demonstrate the presence of periodontal pathogens in the non-mineralised areas of supra- and subgingival dental calculus. methods: subjects for the study were derived from patients with substantial amounts of supragingival calculus in the lower anterior region who had moderate periodontal  disease, having been referred to the periodontal department at the eastman dental hospital for periodontal care. calculus was removed in as large pieces as possible by the use of a sickle or a push scaler placed underneath the apical or  facial border of the calculus and fracturing it from the tooth surface in a single stroke. the orientation and absence of dental plaque was confirmed using light microscopy for each sample prior to inclusion in this study. samples were prepared for transmission electron microscopic (tem) observation after immunogold staining with polyclonal antibodies for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. g.) and treponema denticola (t. d.). results: most of the samples contained at least one of the bacterial species examined, either in the lacunae or in the covering dental plaque. t. d. was the most frequently identified species and was found in nearly  all of the subgingival samples, whilsta. a. was rarely observed. conclusions: in  this limited study, supra- and subgingival dental calculus appears to be capable  of maintaining periodontal pathogens within the deep recesses of its structural lacunae and channels. therefore, calculus could possibly play a relevant role in  the aetiology and pathogenesis of periodontitis. the presence of t. d. in the majority of specimens requires further investigation as its pathogenic potential  may be underestimated in current published microbiological research, and further  work is required to determine its role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. however, further work by way of a large-scale definitive study is necessary to confirm the results of this investigation.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia in primary endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between endodontic clinical signs and symptoms and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia or their association by nested polymerase chain reaction assay. microbial samples were taken from 50 cases with  necrotic pulp tissues in primary infections. dna was extracted from the samples,  which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens by using species-specific primers. p gingivalis, t denticola, and t forsythia were detected in 46%, 38%, and 22% of the symptomatic cases, respectively. the bacterial complex composed by t forsythia, p gingivalis, and t denticola was found in 14% of the cases with spontaneous pain, tenderness to percussion, swelling, and pain on palpation. the high prevalence of p gingivalis, t denticola, and t forsythia in the samples examined suggests that these bacteria are related to the etiology of symptomatic periradicular diseases.

TI  == effect of adjunctive systemic azithromycin with periodontal surgery in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in smokers: a pilot study.
AB  == background: along with conventional surgical therapy, systemic antibiotics may provide more effective treatment in smokers by targeting tissue-invasive bacteria. the aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical  trial was to evaluate the adjunctive effects of systemic azithromycin (azm) in combination with periodontal pocket reduction surgery in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in smokers. methods: thirty patients with a greater than one pack/day smoking habit and generalized moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were randomized to the test (surgery plus 3 days of azm, 500 mg) or control group (surgery plus 3 days of placebo). full-mouth probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop), gingival index (gi), plaque index, and wound healing indices (whi) were assessed at baseline and at 2 weeks and 1, 3, and 6 months following surgical intervention. plaque and gingival crevicular fluid were collected for trypsin-like enzyme activity (benzoyl-dl-arginine naphthylamine) and bone biomarker (crosslinked telopeptide of type i collagen [ictp]) analyses, respectively, at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, and 6 months. results: surgical treatment of moderate (pd = 4 to 6 mm) and deep (pd > 6 mm) pockets significantly improved clinical parameters of treated and untreated teeth (cal gain, pd reduction, and reduction of bop). the additional use of azm did not enhance this improvement nor did it promote reduction of ictp levels. compared to the control group, the test group had significantly better whi scores at 1 month, significantly less gi at 2 weeks, and sustained reductions of red-complex bacteria with trypsin-like enzyme activity at 3 months. for non-surgery teeth, only the test group showed significant gains in  overall cal compared to baseline. conclusions: the findings of this pilot study demonstrated that in heavy smokers, adjunctive systemic azm in combination with pocket reduction surgery did not significantly enhance pd reduction or cal gain.  however, the clinical value of adjunctive azm may be appreciated by more rapid wound healing, less short-term gingival inflammation, and sustained reductions of periopathogenic bacteria. more expanded studies are recommended to better determine the clinical effects of adjunctive azm in patients who smoke.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == minocycline hcl microspheres reduce red-complex bacteria in periodontal disease therapy.
AB  == background: the objective of this trial was to measure the antimicrobial effects  of a minocycline hcl microsphere (mm) local drug-delivery system when used as an  adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp). dna probe analysis for 40 bacteria was used to evaluate the oral bacteria of 127 subjects with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis. methods: subjects were randomly assigned to either srp alone (n = 65) or mm + srp (n = 62). the primary endpoints of this study were changes in numbers and proportions of the red-complex bacteria (rcb) and the sum  of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formally t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola relative to 40 oral bacteria at each test site from baseline  to day 30. numbers of rcb from the five test sites were averaged to provide a value for each subject. results: mm + srp reduced the proportion of rcb by 6.49%  and the numbers by 9.4 x 10(5). the reduction in rcb proportions and numbers by srp alone (5.03% and 5.1 x 10(5), respectively) was significantly less. in addition, mm + srp reduced probing depth by 1.38 mm (compared to 1.01 mm by srp alone), bleeding on probing was reduced by 25.2% (compared to 13.8% by srp alone), and a clinical attachment level gain of 1.16 mm (compared to 0.80 mm by srp alone) was achieved. conclusion: these observations support the hypothesis that rcbs are responsible for periodontal disease and that local antimicrobial therapy using mm + srp effectively reduces numbers of rcbs and their proportions  to a greater extent than srp alone.

TI  == effects of glass ionomer and microfilled composite subgingival restorations on periodontal tissue and subgingival biofilm: a 6-month evaluation.
AB  == background: this 6-month study evaluated the effects of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (rmgi) and microfilled composite (mc) subgingival restorations on periodontal tissues and subgingival biofilm. methods: fifty-four  periodontally healthy patients were assigned as follows: group 1 (n = 18), root exposure (re) without non-carious cervical lesions (nccl) treated with coronally  positioned flap (cpf); group 2 (n = 18), re with nccl treated rmgi restorations plus cpf; group 3 (n = 18), re with nccl treated with mc restorations plus cpf. probing depth (pd), visible local plaque score (pl), and local bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed at baseline and 6 months after surgeries. restored and non-restored root recoverage (rr) was assessed at 6 months. each experimental tooth was subgingivally sampled (baseline and 6 months) and analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: clinical results showed no significant differences among the groups regarding pl, bop, and pd at baseline and 6 months. the rr means were similar among the groups at 6 months. intragroup  analyses revealed that the proportions of 10 periodontopathogens decreased at 6 months for the control group. for the rmgi group, there was a significant decrease in the proportions of nine periodontopathogens. for the mc group, there  was a significant increase in the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum and gemella morbillorum and a decrease in five periodontopathogens. intergroup analyses showed an increase in the proportion of f. nucleatum polymorphum for the mc group. conclusions: in a 6-month evaluation, well-finished rmgi or mc subgingival restorations did not negatively affect periodontal health. furthermore, rmgi seems to exert more positive effects on the subgingival biofilm composition than mc.

AB  == our 10-year study of early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients includes repeated clinical observations, microbiological characteristics and analysis of genetic polymorphism of il-1a and il-1b genes. twenty patients (age 15-26 years) were divided according to the clinical status in the 4th year into a group with mean number of teeth with bleeding on probing (bp) 9.8 and mean number of teeth with periodontal pocket (pp) 2.23, and a group with mean number of teeth with bp 5.37  and no pp. significantly higher values of mean bp and pp were found among the groups during the study but a strong progression of disease was found only in 3 patients. the risk il-1a allele-2 and il-1b allele-2 genotype and bacterial presence were analyzed by dna hybridization methods. no significant differences of bacteria composition (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were found between the groups. a higher prevalence of composite il-1 genotype was detected in the group of eop patients with progressive disease. early finding of the disease followed by conservative therapy could positively influence the disease progression. eop treated in early  stages may, but need not, develop into the aggressive form in the presence of risk genotype il-1.

TI  == bacterial colonization immediately after installation on oral titanium implants.
AB  == background: information on bacterial colonization immediately after dental implant insertion is limited. aims: (1) to assess the early colonization on titanium implants immediately after placement and throughout the first 12 post-surgical weeks, (2) to compare the microbiota at interproximal subgingival implant and adjacent tooth sites. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from implant and neighbouring teeth were studied by checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization before surgery, 30 min after implant placement, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. results: comparing bacterial loads at implant sites between 30 min after placement with 1-week data showed that only the levels of veillonella parvula (p<0.05) differed with higher loads at week 1 post-surgically. week 12 data demonstrated significantly higher bacterial loads for 15/40 species at tooth sites compared with pre-surgery (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.01). between the period immediately after surgery and 12 weeks at implant sites, 29/40 species was more commonly found at 12 weeks. included among these bacteria at implant sites were porphyromonas gingivalis (p<0.05), tannerella forsythia, (p<0.01), and treponema denticola (p<0.001). immediately post-surgery 5.9% of implants, and 26.2% of teeth, and at week 12, 15% of implants, and 39.1% of teeth harbored staphylococcus aureus. comparing tooth and  implant sites, significantly higher bacterial loads were found at tooth sites for 27/40 species after 30 min following implant placement. this difference increased to 35/40 species at 12 weeks post-surgically. conclusions: bacterial colonization occurred within 30 min after implant placement. early colonization patterns differed between implant and tooth surfaces.

TI  == periodontitis as a risk factor of coronary heart diseases?
AB  == background: unstable atherosclerotic plaque is a dangerous clinical state, possibly leading to acute coronary deficiency resulting in cardiac infarction. inflammatory factor's role in creating pathological lesions in the endothelium of coronary vessels is frequently raised. this state may be caused by bacteria able  to initiate clot formation in blood vessel and destabilizing atherosclerotic plaque already present. source of these pathogens are chronic inflammatory processes occurring in organism, among them periodontal disease as one of more frequent. aim of the work was to evaluate incidence of selected anaerobic bacteria in subgingival plaque and in atherosclerotic plaque in patients treated  surgically because of coronary vessels' obliteration. methods: study was performed on 20 individuals with chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque was collected from periodontal pockets deeper than 5 mm dna test was used for marking eight pathogens responsible for periodontal tissues destruction. in the same patients, as well as in 10 edentulous individuals material from atherosclerotic plaque was collected during by-pass implantation procedure, and identical dna testing occurred. results: in 13 of 20 patients pathogens most frequent in severe chronic periodontitis were found in coronary vessels. in 10 cases those bacteria  were also present in atherosclerotic plaque. pathogens linked with periodontal disease were also found in 7 of 10 edentulous individuals. most frequently marked bacteria were: porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. conclusions: it  seems that advancement of periodontal disease does not have influence on bacteria permeability to coronary vessels. important is the presence of active inflammatory process expressed by significantly higher bleeding index in patients with marked bacteria in atherosclerotic plaque.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as indicator for aggressive periodontitis by two analysing strategies.
AB  == objective: to compare the subgingival microbiota of aggressive and chronic periodontitis (chp) using single-site and pooled plaque samples. methods: in 60 patients with aggressive or chp, subgingival plaque was sampled from the four deepest pockets using two sterile paper points simultaneously. one paper point from each pocket was put in a separate transport vial, the second was pooled with the three other paper points of a respective patient. the content of each vial was analysed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola. results: pooled plaque samples detected higher numbers for all tested pathogens than single-site samples. detection frequencies were similar for both strategies. using single-site samples, a. actinomycetemcomitans detection rate was statistically significantly  a higher in aggressive than in chp (p=0.01). a. actinomycetemcomitans was found in higher numbers, the other pathogens in lower numbers in aggressive than in chp. neither presence nor absence of one of the tested bacteria had sufficient positive or negative predictive value for aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in higher numbers and frequency in aggressive than in chp. its detection may confirm the clinical diagnosis and influence therapy. as a diagnostic test, its sensitivity and predictive value was low.

TI  == prevalence of four putative periodontopathic bacteria in saliva of a group of brazilian children with mixed dentition: 1-year longitudinal study.
AB  == aim: this study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola) in saliva of children with mixed dentition at two different time points, correlating these findings with a clinical parameter of gingival health. design: polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection was used to determine the prevalence of these bacteria in saliva of 64  children in 2003 and 60 children in 2004. gingival health was assessed by gingival index. result: sixty-two (96.9%) and 50 (83.3%) children presented low gingival inflammation, whereas 2 (3.1%) and 10 (16.7%) had moderate scores in 2003 and 2004, respectively. majority of the children (81.3% in 2003 and 73.3% in 2004) had detectable levels of at least one of the bacteria. the prevalence found was of 4.7% and 1.7% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 6.3% and 8.3% for p. gingivalis, 23.4% and 48.3% for p. nigrescens (p < 0.05), and 71.9% and 50% for t. denticola (p < 0.05) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. no significant relationship between gingival index and presence of these bacteria and combination of different species was found. conclusion: a high percentage of children harboured at least one of the putative periodontal pathogens in saliva,  but presented periodontally healthy conditions.

TI  == the detection of eight putative periodontal pathogens in adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients: an institutional study.
AB  == purpose: periodontal disease is a commonly prevalent problem faced alike by both  the developed and third world countries but showing wide variations in prevalence and severity across different geographical areas. the purpose was to identify actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), ekinella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), bacteroides forsythus (bf), treponema denticola (td) and fusobacterium nucleatum  (fn) in indian adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients. materials and methods: paper points were used to collect the sample from 28 sites in both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis (8 healthy/20 diseased sites) patients and dna analysis done. the categorical data was analysed by fishers exact test and difference in the clinical parameters was tested by mann-whitney test. results: in healthy sites of adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients, aa, ec, bf and aa, pg, pi, td, fn were detected respectively. however, when diseased and healthy sites were compared in  both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients respectively, only pg( p =0.004), cr( p =0.04), fn( p =0.014) and pg( p =0.002),  cr( p =0.02), fn( p =0.008) were statistically significant. conclusion: the prevalence of the microorganisms correlate with the clinical parameters like probing depth and bleeding on probing as seen in the japanese and western periodontitis patients' population.

TI  == subgingival chlorhexidine varnish administration as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological observations.
AB  == background: recently, the clinical additive value of a highly concentrated chlorhexidine (chx) varnish, when applied subgingivally as an adjunct to scaling  and root planing, was described. the objective of the present study was to investigate the microbiological impact of a treatment strategy for chronic periodontitis based on a combination of same-day full-mouth root planing and subgingival chx varnish administration. methods: a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel trial was conducted on 33 non-smoking chronic periodontitis patients. the control group received oral hygiene instructions and  same-day full-mouth root planing. the test group received the same instructions and treatment; however, all pockets also were disinfected using a supersaturated  chx varnish. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the deepest site per  quadrant in each patient at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. pooled sample  analysis was performed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method for the identification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola  (td), and prevotella intermedia (pi). results: in terms of detection frequency and bacterial levels, significant, mainly temporary, reductions from baseline were found in both groups. when a comparison was made between the control and the test group, significant differences in the detection frequency of tf (p = 0.024)  and td (p = 0.024), which favored the test group, were found at 1 month. a similar phenomenon was seen for td (p = 0.031) based on bacterial levels. an important trend toward lower tf levels in the test group also was found at 1 month (p = 0.052). compared to baseline levels, microbiological benefits in the test group seemed to be maintained, at least in part, over a 6-month period. in contrast, all microbial levels had relapsed in the control group at study termination. conclusion: the microbiological results of the present study promote the subgingival administration of a highly concentrated chx varnish as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing.

TI  == evaluation of the incidence of periodontitis-associated bacteria in the atherosclerotic plaque of coronary blood vessels.
AB  == background: unstable atherosclerotic plaque is a dangerous clinical condition, possibly leading to acute coronary deficiency resulting in cardiac infarction. questions about the role of inflammatory factors in the formation of pathological lesions in the endothelium of coronary vessels have often been raised. this condition may be caused by bacteria that are able to initiate clot formation in a blood vessel, destabilizing an atherosclerotic plaque that is already present. the sources of these pathogens are chronic inflammatory processes occurring in the host, including periodontal disease, which is one of the most frequent conditions. the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of selected anaerobic bacteria in subgingival and atherosclerotic plaque in patients treated  surgically because of coronary vessel obliteration. methods: the study was performed on 20 individuals with chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque was collected from periodontal pockets >5 mm. dna testing was used to identify eight  pathogens responsible for periodontal tissue destruction. material from atherosclerotic plaques was collected from the same patients during bypass surgery, and dna testing by the same method was performed. results: in 13 of 20 patients, the pathogens most frequently found in severe chronic periodontitis were also found in coronary vessels. in 10 cases, those species of bacteria were  also present in atherosclerotic plaque. the most frequently identified bacteria were porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. conclusions: in patients with the severe form of chronic periodontitis, it seems that clinical attachment  loss is not associated with bacterial permeability into coronary vessels. what is important is the presence of an active inflammatory process expressed by a significantly higher bleeding index in those patients in whom the examined bacterial species were found in atherosclerotic plaque.

TI  == identification of the microorganisms responsible for periodontopathy by multiplex rt-pcr.
AB  == the aim of our research was to identify by bacterial genomic dna analysis the prevalence of five different species of periodontopathogenic bacteria present in  the subgingival biofilm, specifically: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), bacterioides forsytus  (bf), treponema denticola (td). for the analysis we used the systematic multiplex-pcr-microdent kit with species-specific primers. we studied a group of  48 subjects, 18 males and 30 females, from 18 to 78 years of age. the initial clinical screening enabled us to select, among the group analysed, 24 subjects with signs of active periodontopathy (group a) and 24 patients without identifiable clinical evidence of the disease used as the control group (group b). within the two experimental groups (a and b), the test was found to be positive in 75% of subjects from group a, whereas the test was found to be negative in all the subjects from group b. our research shows that the multiplex-pcr system is reliable. furthermore, the sensitivity and simplicity of  this technique, as well as the decrease in working times and the possibility of identifying non-culturable bacteria, since the presence of viable organisms is not essential, make this technique indicated for the simultaneous identification  of periodontopathogenic bacteria and might, in perspective, provide a more effective clinical alternative to the techniques of bacterial typing of the subgingival plaque.

TI  == rat model of polymicrobial infection, immunity, and alveolar bone resorption in periodontal disease.
AB  == one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans is expressed clinically as periodontal disease. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly implicated as members of a pathogenic consortium in the etiology of adult periodontitis. in this study we hypothesized  that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia are synergistic in terms of virulence potential and induce chronic periodontal inflammation that leads to alveolar bone resorption in a polymicrobial infection in rats. groups of rats were infected with either p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia in monomicrobial infections or with all three species in polymicrobial oral infections with or without fusobacterium nucleatum. pcr analyses of oral microbial samples demonstrated that rats infected with one bacterium were orally  colonized by each of the bacteria during the study interval, and increased serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody levels substantiated the interaction of the host  with the infecting bacteria. pcr analyses of the rats with polymicrobial infections demonstrated that most rats were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a consortium. furthermore, all rats exhibited a significant increase in the level of igg antibody to the polymicrobial consortium. radiographic measurement of alveolar bone resorption showed that rats infected with the polymicrobial consortium with or without f. nucleatum exhibited significantly increased alveolar bone resorption compared to the resorption in uninfected control rats, as well as the resorption in rats infected with one of the microbes. these results documented that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia not only exist as a consortium that is associated with chronic periodontitis but also exhibit synergistic virulence resulting in the immunoinflammatory bone resorption characteristic of periodontitis.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to compare the results of microbiological rna-probe analysis after subgingival plaque sampling applying two different strategies. methods: in 220 patients, clinical examinations were obtained prior to commencement of therapy for aggressive or generalized severe chronic periodontitis (n = 113), after combined mechanical and antibiotic anti-infective periodontal therapy (n = 43), or because of periodontal pockets despite adequate therapy (n = 64). subgingival plaque samples were obtained from  the three pockets with the deepest probing depths. two sterile paper points were  inserted simultaneously into the periodontal pockets. one paper point from each pocket was put into a separate transport vial; the second paper point was pooled  (multiple site test [mt3]) with paper points from each of the two other sampling  sites from the respective patient into a transport vial. the content of each vial was analyzed separately for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola (td) with a commercially available rna-probe test. results: for all tested pathogens, log-transformed numbers of bacteria were higher in pooled samples compared to the mean values for the separate samples (p < or =0.01). however, for td only, statistically significant differences in frequency were seen between the separate samples and mt3. these findings were observed over all samples as well as after evaluation of subgroups separately. conclusions: pooling of plaque samples increased the bacterial counts per analysis compared to separate samples and thus may increase the probability of detecting existing pathogens. however, this observation only was statistically significant for the frequency of td.

TI  == prevalence of selected bacterial named species and uncultivated phylotypes in endodontic abscesses from two geographic locations.
AB  == evidence is mounting that the prevalence of some putative endodontic pathogens can significantly vary according to the geographic location in which samples were taken. this study aimed to provide additional knowledge on this subject by comparing the frequencies of 10 selected candidate endodontic pathogens in samples of acute apical abscesses obtained from two distinct geographic locations; portland, or, and rio de janeiro, brazil. dna was extracted from aspirates and used as template in nested pcr assays using 16s rrna gene taxon-specific oligonucleotide primers. of the target species/phylotypes, treponema denticola (73% of the cases), porphyromonas endodontalis (70%), and tannerella forsythia (57%) were the most prevalent taxa found in brazilian samples. dialister invisus (70% of the cases), p. endodontalis (63%) and dialister pneumosintes (55%) were the most frequent taxa in the portland, or samples. data analysis revealed that t. denticola and t. forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in the portland, or samples. although d. invisus, filifactor alocis, and synergistes oral clone w090  were detected in many more samples from the portland, or patients, differences were not found to be statistically significant. these findings confirmed that some bacterial taxa can markedly differ in the frequencies they occur in samples  from different locations. it remains to be clarified whether this observation translates into relevant therapeutic implications.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == [pathogenic potential of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, the red bacterial complex associated with periodontitis].
AB  == periodontitis are mixed bacterial infections leading to destruction of tooth-supporting tissues, including periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. among over 500 bacterial species living in the oral cavity, a bacterial complex named "red complex" and made of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia has been strongly related to advanced periodontal lesions. while periodontopathogenic bacteria are the primary etiologic factor of periodontitis, tissue destruction essentially results from the host immune response to the bacterial challenge. members of the red complex are gram negative anaerobic bacteria expressing numerous virulence factors allowing bacteria to colonize the subgingival sites, to disturb the host defense system, to invade and destroy periodontal tissue as well as to promote the immunodestructive host response. this article reviews current knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of  bacteria of the red complex leading to tissue and alveolar bone destruction observed during periodontitis.

TI  == periodontal infections and cardiovascular disease: the heart of the matter.
AB  == background: oral infection models have emerged as useful tools to study the hypothesis that infection is a cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk factor. periodontal infections are a leading culprit, with studies reporting associations between periodontal disease and cvd. the results, however, have varied, and it often is unclear what conclusions can be drawn from these data. summary: an association exists between periodontal disease and cvd. it is unknown, however, whether this relationship is causal or coincidental. early studies predominantly  used nonspecific clinical and radiographic definitions of periodontal disease as  surrogates for infectious exposure. while most studies demonstrated positive associations between periodontal disease and cvd, not all studies were positive,  and substantial variations in results were evident. more recent studies have enhanced the specificity of infectious exposure definitions by measuring systemic antibodies to selected periodontal pathogens or by directly measuring and quantifying oral microbiota from subgingival dental plaque. results from these studies have shown positive associations between periodontal disease and cvd. conclusions: evidence continues to support an association among periodontal infections, atherosclerosis and vascular disease. ongoing observational and focused pilot intervention studies may inform the design of large-scale clinical  intervention studies. recommending periodontal treatment for the prevention of atherosclerotic cvd is not warranted based on scientific evidence. periodontal treatment must be recommended on the basis of the value of its benefits for the oral health of patients, recognizing that patients are not healthy without good oral health. however, the emergence of periodontal infections as a potential risk factor for cvd is leading to a convergence in oral and medical care that can only benefit the patients and public health.

TI  == molecular analysis of filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola associated with primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of strict anaerobes such as filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in primary and secondary root-infected canals with periapical lesions by molecular analysis and  the association of these species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. microbial samples were taken from 100 root canals, 50 with necrotic pulp tissues  (npt, primary infection), and 50 with failed endodontic treatment (fet, secondary infection). dna was extracted from the samples, which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens using species-specific primers and pcr. f. alocis were isolated from 23 canals with npt and 12 canals with fet; t. forsythia from 12 canals with npt and three canals with fet; t. denticola from 19 canals with npt and 12 canals with tep. suggested associations were found between primary infection and the presence of f. alocis and t. forsythia (both p < 0.05). in particular, associations were found between: pain and f. alocis; swelling and  f. alocis; tenderness to percussion and t. forsythia; mobility and t. forsythia and t. denticola; wet canals and f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola; purulent exsudate and f. alocis, t. forsythia and t. denticola; abscess and f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola (all p < 0.05). the findings of this study indicated that f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola seem to be associated with endodontic signs and symptoms. additionally, f. alocis and t. forsythia were detected more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria.
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. tap water was electrolyzed in a water vessel  using platinum cell technology. the electrolyzed tap water (called puri-water) was put in contact with five major periodontopathogens or toothbrushes contaminated with these bacteria for 30 sec. in addition, puri-water was used as  a mouthwash for 30 sec in 16 subjects and the antibacterial effect on salivary bacteria was evaluated. puri-water significantly reduced the growth of all periodontopathogens in culture and on toothbrushes, and that of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in saliva, when compared to the effect of tap water. it also significantly reduced mutans streptococci growing on mitis salivarius-bacitracin  agar. our results demonstrate that the electrolyzed tap water is effective as a mouthwash and for toothbrush disinfection.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles enhance attachment, and the leucine-rich repeat bspa protein is required for invasion of epithelial cells by "tannerella forsythia".
AB  == the human oral cavity harbors more than 500 species of bacteria. periodontitis, a bacterially induced inflammatory disease that leads to tooth loss, is believed to result from infection by a select group of gram-negative periodontopathogens that includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and "tannerella forsythia" (opinion on name change from tannerella forsythensis pending; formerly bacteroides forsythus). epithelial cell invasion by periodontopathogens is considered to be an important virulence mechanism for evasion of the host defense responses. further, the epithelial cells with invading bacteria also serve as reservoirs important in recurrent infections. the present study was therefore undertaken to address the epithelial cell adherence and invasion properties of t. forsythia and the role of the cell surface-associated protein bspa in these processes. further, we were interested in determining if p. gingivalis, one of the pathogens frequently found associated in disease, or its outer membrane vesicles (omvs) could modulate the epithelial cell adherence and invasion abilities of t. forsythia. here we show that epithelial cell attachment and invasion by t. forsythia are dependent on the bspa protein. in addition, p. gingivalis or its omvs enhance the attachment and invasion of t. forsythia to epithelial cells. thus, interactions between these two bacteria may play important roles in virulence by promoting host cell attachment and invasion.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and microbiological healing outcomes following non-surgical periodontal therapy using a modified sonic scaler system versus scaling and root planing (s/rp) with hand instruments. material and methods: the study comprised 20 chronic periodontitis patients. using a split-mouth design, both treatment modalities were randomly applied to one quadrant of the upper and lower jaws. clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 months after treatment. furthermore, post-operative hypersensitivity was investigated. the wilcoxon signed-rank test (alpha = 0.05) was used for statistical analysis. results: with both therapy methods, periodontal conditions showed statistically significant clinical and microbiological improvements after 4 weeks and 6 months. hypersensitive teeth were found only 4 weeks after s/rp. besides a significantly better bleeding on probing reduction in deep s/rp sites and less time required for root instrumentation by the sonic scaler, no other clinical and microbiological parameters revealed significant differences between sites treated with the sonic  scaler or s/rp. conclusion: the sonic scaler system and s/rp seem to provide similarly favourable periodontal healing results, although in deep pockets s/rp appeared to achieve a better resolution of inflammation.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to compare serum antibody responses to periodontal pathogens after single-visit full-mouth ultrasonic debridement and quadrant-wise therapy. material and methods: thirty-six subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomized into three groups: quadrant-wise debridement in four visits, one-visit full-mouth debridement with water and with povidone iodine. blood samples were collected before and immediately after treatment and 1, 3 and 6 months post-therapy. serum antibody titres and avidity to porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and thiocyanate elisa, respectively. results: igg titres to p. gingivalis significantly decreased at 1, 3 and 6 months in full-mouth debridement with water group, while significant reductions were seen only at 3 and 6 months after quadrant-wise debridement. both full-mouth groups showed significant reduction in igg titres to a. actinomycetemcomitans at 3 and 6 months. significant increases in antibody avidity to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were noted 3 months following full-mouth debridement with povidone. conclusion: both full-mouth and quadrant treatments generally resulted  in a decrease in antibody titres and increase in antibody avidity. full-mouth debridement induced an earlier reduction of igg titre to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans, than quadrant-wise therapy.

TI  == bacterial profile and burden of periodontal infection in subjects with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontitis has been identified as a potential risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. it is possible that the stimulation of host responses to oral infections may result in vascular damage and the inducement of blood clotting. the aim of this study was to assess the role of periodontal infection and bacterial burden as an explanatory variable to the activation of the inflammatory process leading to acute coronary syndrome (acs). methods: a total of 161 consecutive surviving cases admitted with a diagnosis of acs and 161 control subjects, matched with cases according to their gender, socioeconomic level, and smoking status, were studied. serum white blood cell (wbc) counts, high- and low-density lipoprotein (hdl/ldl) levels, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsc-rp) levels, and clinical periodontal routine parameters were studied. the subgingival pathogens were assayed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: total oral bacterial load was higher in the subjects with acs (mean difference: 17.4x10(5); sd: 10.8; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 4.2 to 17.4; p<0.001), and significant for 26 of 40 species including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. serum wbc counts, hsc-rp levels, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis,  were explanatory factors to acute coronary syndrome status (nagelkerke r2=0.49).  conclusion: the oral bacterial load of s. intermedius, s. sanguis, streptococcus  anginosus, t. forsythensis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis may be concomitant risk factors in the development of acs.

TI  == inhibitory effects of macrocarpals on the biological activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: macrocarpals, which are phloroglucinol derivatives contained in  eucalyptus leaves, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria including oral bacteria. this study examined effects of macrocarpals a, b, and c  on periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: macrocarpals a, b, and c were purified from a 60% ethanol-extract of eucalyptus globules leaves. to investigate antibacterial activity, representative periodontopathic bacteria were cultured in media with or without various amounts  of macrocarpals; subsequently, the optical density at 660 nm was measured. macrocarpal inhibition of p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases was assessed by spectrofluorophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. the effect of macrocarpals on p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was examined with  (3)h-labeled p. gingivalis. results: growth of p. gingivalis was inhibited more strongly than growth of prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola by macrocarpals, however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum were much more resistant. macrocarpals inhibited p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases in a dose-dependent manner. the enzyme-inhibitory effect of macrocarpals was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in which hemoglobin degradation by p. gingivalis proteinase was inhibited by macrocarpals. p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also strongly attenuated by macrocarpals. conclusions: macrocarpals a, b and c demonstrated antibacterial activity against periodontopathic bacteria. among tested bacteria,  p. gingivalis displayed the greatest sensitivity to macrocarpals; additionally, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. these results indicate that eucalyptus leaf extracts may be useful as a potent preventative of periodontal disease.

TI  == langerhans' cell histiocytosis in a 5-year-old girl: evidence of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: langerhans' cell histiocytosis (lch) is a rare disorder characterized by langerhans' cell proliferation in various organs or tissues. when periodontal  tissue is involved, clinical manifestations can vary from gingival recession and  pocket formation to severe alveolar bone loss. this case report describes periodontal pathogens found in the pockets of involved primary teeth. methods: a  5-year-old girl with lch presented with loose teeth. intraoral examination and radiographs revealed deep pockets and severe bone loss around all primary molars. bacterial samples were obtained from saliva and subgingival plaque and analyzed for the presence of five periodontopathic bacteria using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. due to severe periodontal destruction, all primary molars  were extracted, and a gingival biopsy was taken from tooth t to confirm the diagnosis of lch. results: the biopsy specimen revealed the histologic features of lch. the patient was diagnosed as having periodontitis as a manifestation of lch. pcr results of subgingival plaque from lch-affected molars indicated the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was absent from these teeth. no tested bacteria were found  in the non-affected anterior teeth. conclusions: the bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease were detected in subgingival plaque samples from this lch patient. more microbiological data are required to understand the role of these bacteria in lch-associated periodontal destruction.

AB  == aims: the objective of this study was to characterize the inhibitory effects of weissella cibaria isolates on volatile sulphur compounds (vsc) production both in vitro and in vivo. material and methods: we isolated and identified three hydrogen peroxide-generating lactobacilli from children's saliva, and assessed their inhibitory effects on vsc production and fusobacterium nucleatum proliferation. clinical studies were conducted with 46 subjects in order to measure the vsc of their mouth air. results: these lactobacilli were identified as w. cibaria. these isolates inhibited the production of vsc by f. nucleatum (p<0.05). the concentration of f. nucleatum was decreased by 5-log cycles as a result of exposure to the w. cibaria strains (p<0.05), whereas the catalase-treated w. cibaria cultures exerted no evident inhibitory effects on f.  nucleatum replication. in the clinical studies, gargling with one isolate resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of h2s and ch3sh by approximately 48.2% (p<0.01) and 59.4% (p<0.05), respectively. conclusions: these results indicate that w. cibaria isolates possess the ability to inhibit vsc production under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, demonstrating that they bear the potential for development into novel probiotics for use in the oral cavity.

TI  == is pre-term labour associated with periodontitis in a danish maternity ward?
AB  == objectives: to reveal differences in periodontal status and presence of subgingival bacteria in a scandinavian population of women with pre-term birth compared with women who delivered at term. materials and methods: twenty-one women with pre-term labour (before week 35) and 33 women with term labour (between weeks 38 and 41) were included in this case-control study. periodontal measurements included plaque index (pli), probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop). inter-proximal distances from the cemento-enamel junction (cej) to the marginal bone crest (mbc) were measured on bitewing radiographs. in 31 patients (16 cases and 15 controls) the subgingival plaque was analysed using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization. results: differences between the two examined groups were found related to "twin births" (p=0.0064) and "smokers" (p=0.03). none of the periodontal measurements showed any association. significant differences were found concerning presence of tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga ochracea but when defining sites with >10(5) bacteria as heavily colonized, no statistical difference was found between the two groups. conclusion: a relation between pre-term birth and periodontitis was not revealed in the present study.

TI  == effect of a stannous fluoride dentifrice on the sulcular microbiota: a prospective cohort study in subjects with various levels of periodontal inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  == early colonization of non-submerged dental implants in patients with a history of advanced aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the early colonization of non-submerged implants over a 6-month period in partially edentulous patients treated for advanced aggressive periodontal disease. in 22 patients treated for advanced aggressive periodontitis and in a supportive maintenance program for a period between 12 and 240 months at implant surgery, a total of 68 non-submerged dental  implants were installed. patients had a plaque score below 20%, and less than 20% of the pockets around the teeth were bleeding on probing (bop). using dna-probes  (micro-ident), the presence and concentration of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythensis (tf) and treponema denticola  (td)) were determined in the five deepest pockets of the rest dentition pre-operatively and after 6 months as well as five places around each implant 10  days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. in each patient, a test to determine the genotype interleukin-1 (il-1) was performed (pst - micro-ident). after 6 months, no difference in microbial composition as compared with baseline  was found around the teeth in five patients, in 12 minute differences and in five patients important differences were observed. ten days after surgery, three patients had a complete similar bacterial composition between teeth and implants. in 14 patients, the composition was fairly similar, while large differences in composition and concentration occurred in five patients. this microbiota around the implants remained almost unchanged over a 6-month period and did not hamper the clinical and radiographic osseointegration and did not lead to peri-implantitis, mucositis or initiation of bone destruction.

TI  == comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  == studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) sampling methods. the purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and gcf samples using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. a total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. the mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (sd+/-4.7). on average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (sd+/-2.9). the  proportion of streptococcus oralis (p<0.02) and fusobacterium periodonticum (p<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). the gcf samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). the proportions of tannerella forsythia (t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola were both higher in gcf samples (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). the microbial  composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of porphyromonas gingivalis. a combination of gcf and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein vaccine reduces the alveolar bone loss induced by multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: heat shock protein (hsp) can be utilized as a vaccine to cross-protect against multiple pathogenic species. the present study was performed to evaluate porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) as a vaccine candidate to inhibit multiple bacteria-induced alveolar bone loss. material and methods: recombinant p. gingivalis hsp60 was produced and purified from p. gingivalis groel gene. rats were immunized with p. gingivalis hsp60, and  experimental alveolar bone loss was induced by infection with multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria. results: there was a very strong inverse relationship between postimmune anti-p. gingivalis hsp immunoglobulin g (igg) levels and the amount of alveolar bone loss induced by either p. gingivalis or multiple bacterial infection (p=0.007). polymerase chain reaction data indicated  that the vaccine successfully eradicated the multiple pathogenic species. conclusions: we concluded that p. gingivalis hsp60 could potentially be developed as a vaccine to inhibit periodontal disease induced by multiple pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == resolution of furcation bone loss after non-surgical root canal treatment: application of a peptidase-detection kit for treatment of type i endoperiodontal  lesion.
AB  == here, we report the management of a type i endoperiodontal lesion with furcation  bone loss. a 59-year-old female attended our hospital with the chief complaint of mobility of tooth 46 and recurrent gingival swelling around the tooth. she previously received dental treatment from two dentists, but her condition did not improve. the tooth manifested the symptoms of typical periodontitis, such as gingival swelling, tooth mobility, pus discharge from the periodontal pocket and  furcation bone loss. the tooth had no caries and the pulp reacted to an electric  pulp test. careful examination of the gingiva revealed traces of dental fistula.  x-ray examination via a gutta percha inserted into the fistula revealed that furcation bone loss was associated with the periapical lesion. we diagnosed a type i endoperiodontal lesion, and applied periocheck, a detection kit for peptidase-producing bacteria, to check for decreases in bacteria in the furcation and root canals. soon after non-surgical root canal treatment, the condition of tooth 46 improved without periodontal treatment. after confirming a negative score with periocheck, the root canal was filled. after 3 months, the furcation bone loss was on the way to recovery. these results indicate that proper diagnosis and confirmation of a decrease in root canal bacteria are important for treating endoperiodontal lesions.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == involvement of periodontopathic anaerobes in aspiration pneumonia.
AB  == increasing evidence has linked the anaerobic bacteria forming periodontopathic biofilms with aspiration pneumonia in elderly persons. in experiments designed to eliminate the potent respiratory pathogens forming biofilms in the oral cavity, we have shown that the mechanical and chemical oral cleansing using povidone-iodine effectively reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae in patients scheduled to undergo oral surgery requiring endotracheal intubation. we confirmed the pathogenicity of periodontopathic anaerobic bacteria for aspiration pneumonia in an experimental mouse model. based upon the finding of the coexistence of porphyromonas gingivalis with treponema denticola in chronic periodontitis lesions, we innoculated a mixed culture of p.  gingivalis and t. denticola into the mouse trachea; the resulting infection induced inflammatory cytokine production and caused pneumonia. in another series  of investigations, professional oral health care (pohc), mainly cleansing administered by dental hygienists once a week for 24 months to elderly persons requiring daily care, resulted in the reduction of the number of total anaerobes, candida albicans, and staphylococcus species and in the number of cases of fatal  aspiration pneumonia. we also found that the pohc treatment of elderly persons for 6 months in the winter season reduced the salivary levels of protease, trypsin-like activity, and neuraminidase and also decreased the frequency of influenza cases.

TI  == biofilm formation by the periodontopathic bacteria treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background: periodontitis develops as a result of the interaction of the host with subgingival plaque bacteria. both porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola are frequently associated together in these oral biofilms. methods: the molecular basis for in vitro biofilm formation was investigated for p. gingivalis 381, t. denticola 35405, and mixtures of the two organisms using microtiter plate assays. in addition, the biofilms were examined following confocal laser scanning microscopy. results: p. gingivalis 381, but not t. denticola strains, formed biofilms in vitro. this property was dependent, in part, on the strain 381 fima,  ppk, and usp genes. microarray and northern blot analyses suggested that the expression of the ppk gene was required for maximal expression of the uspa gene.  p. gingivalis 381 formed synergistic biofilms when incubated with t. denticola strains. this process was dependent upon the strain 381 rgpb and fima genes as well as the t. denticola flge and cfpa genes. conclusions: p. gingivalis 381 formed synergistic biofilms with t. denticola 35405. these results may be relevant to the previous observations that the two organisms are frequently observed together in subgingival plaque with the spirochetes localized to the exterior of the oral biofilms. it is suggested that other such synergistic effects may also occur between other plaque bacteria.

AB  == background/aims: the presence of selected bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola) in infected root canals was studied using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays, and the association of bacteria with clinical signs of endodontic disease was assessed. the null hypothesis, that no difference could be observed between clinical signs of apical periodontitis and a specific bacterial  strain, was tested. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 62 teeth in 54  patients with endodontic disease. for each tooth, clinical data including patient symptoms were collected. teeth were categorized by diagnosis as having acute apical periodontitis (aap, teeth with clinical symptoms but no periapical radiolucency, n=22), chronic apical periodontitis (cap, teeth with radiolucency but no clinical symptoms, n=15) or exacerbated apical periodontitis (eap, teeth with symptoms and radiolucency, n=25). seventy-one percent of cases were primary  endodontic infections, and 29% were recurrent ('secondary') endodontic infections (failing cases). pcr assays were used to detect the presence of the selected bacteria. results: t. denticola and e. faecalis were each detected in 15 of 62 samples (24%), p. gingivalis in 8 samples (13%), p. intermedia in 5 samples (8%), and t. forsythensis in 4 samples (7%). t. denticola was detected in 56% of teeth  with eap. e. faecalis was found in 60% of teeth with cap and in 72% of teeth with secondary infection. statistical analysis demonstrated an association of cap and  secondary endodontic infection with the presence of e. faecalis. (p<0.01). eap was associated with the presence of t. denticola (p<0.01). conclusion: t. denticola was associated with symptomatic endodontic disease in the presence of apical bone resorption. e. faecalis was associated with treatment failures. we suggest that these species may play critical roles in endodontic pathology.

AB  == background: the association between the infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola in chronic periodontitis (cp) and the severity of periodontal disease remains to be elucidated. the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival infection frequencies of three periodontopathic bacteria in chinese cp patients and to evaluate the correlations between infection by these bacteria and periodontal destruction. methods: a multiple pcr assay using primers derived from 16srdna genes of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola was established to measure simultaneously the presence of the three microbes in 162 subgingival samples from 81 chinese cp patients. results: the positive rates of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the subgingival samples  were 84.6%, 83.3% and 88.3%, respectively. of the subgingival samples, 68% revealed the coinfection of all the three microbes. the infection rates with p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans or t. denticola alone was 5.9% (1/17), 17.6% (3/17) and 76.5% (13/17), respectively. a close association was present between the a. actinomycetemcomitans infection and gingival index (gi) (p < 0.01), but not between p. gingivalis or t. denticola infection and gi (p > 0.05). p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were more frequently detectable in middle and deep pockets than in shallow ones (p < 0.01), while t. denticola was found remarkably often in deep pockets (p < 0.05). the coinfection rate of the three microbes was significantly higher in sites with severe periodontitis than in those with mild periodontitis (p < 0.01). conclusions: the multiple pcr established in this study can be used as a sensitive and specific method to simultaneously detect all three microbes in subgingival samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans infection may be associated with cp and play an important role in the periodontal tissue destruction. the coinfection of p. gingivalis, a.  actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola can cause more serious periodontal destruction than infection of any one or two of the three microbes.

AB  == objectives: to compare the clinical and microbiological outcome of non-surgical periodontal therapy after 6 months with data obtained after hygienic phase or 6 weeks after completion of non-surgical therapy, in order to evaluate the value of clinical and microbiological parameters to predict treatment success. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were available from 271 sites in 10 systemically healthy non-smokers with moderate-to-advanced chronic periodontal disease (24-32 sites per individual). subgingival plaque samples were tested for  the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola using rna probes. results: stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant impact of the number of sites with visible plaque index >1 after hygienic phase on the bleeding tendency of a subject at month 6 (p<0.01). furthermore, an association could be demonstrated between the number of residual pockets (pd>3 mm) 6 months after therapy and the number of bleeding sites and suppurating sites after hygienic phase (p=0.016). six weeks after therapy, the mean total bacterial loads had a significant impact on the bleeding tendency of a subject at month 6 (p<0.01). although the average numbers of sites with persisting p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. forsythensis and t. denticola seemed to be very similar 6 weeks and 6 months after therapy, large variations were noted between subjects, and therefore the microbiological status of a subject at week 6 could not predict the status at month 6. conclusions: the present study showed a limited potential  of microbiological tests, performed after hygienic phase or shortly after non-surgical periodontal therapy, to predict the clinical outcome 6 months later, but confirmed the importance of an establishment of perfect oral hygiene before non-surgical therapy.

TI  == [critical assessment of microbiological diagnostics in periodontal diseases with  special focus on porphyromonas gingivalis].
AB  == periodontitis is caused by an opportunistic infection with pathogenic microorganisms of the oral biofilm. in this paper, we discuss the usefulness of microbial diagnostics with respect to the differential diagnosis or the treatment approaches of periodontal diseases. several diagnostic techniques, based on morphological, enzymatic, cultural, genetic or antigenetic properties have been established to analyze the microbial flora. among the bacterial species some virulent genotypes of p. gingivalis play an important role in the etiology of periodontitis. expression of fimbriae or different proteases have been identified as potential virulence factors of this gram negative anaerobic rod. to date a characterization of virulence of specific strains or a correlation between expression of different virulence factors and distinct periodontal conditions, however, is missing. therefore, the importance of a routine identification of p.  gingivalis still needs further evaluation.

TI  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for rapid detection of the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola.
AB  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), a novel nucleic acid amplification method, was developed for the rapid detection of the major periodontal pathogens  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. the lamp method amplifies dna with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity under isothermal conditions using a set of four specially designed primers and a dna polymerase with strand displacement activity. in this study, we initially designed the primers for lamp assays to detect these bacteria and evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of these assays. the specificities of the primers for these bacteria were examined using various oral bacteria and various reaction times. the lower detection limits of the 60-min lamp reaction without loop primers were 1 microg/tube for p. gingivalis, 10 fg/tube for t. forsythia, and 1  ng/tube for t. denticola. addition of the loop primers for each bacterium improved the detection specificities and sensitivities by several magnitudes. furthermore, lamp assays were applied to the rapid detection of these periodontal pathogens in clinical specimens, and the results were compared with those of conventional pcr detection. the results of the lamp assays corresponded to those  of conventional pcr assays. these results indicate that the lamp assay is an extremely rapid, highly sensitive, specific method. this method is very useful for the rapid detection of periodontopathic bacteria and the diagnosis of periodontal disease.

TI  == high production of methyl mercaptan by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane lyase from treponema denticola.
AB  == methyl mercaptan is derived from l-methionine by the action of l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane lyase (metase) and is a major component of oral malodor. this compound is highly toxic and is thought to play an important role in periodontal disease. we found that treponema denticola, a member of the subgingival biofilm at periodontal disease sites, produced a large  amount of methyl mercaptan even at low concentration of l-methionine. metase activity in a cell-free extract from t. denticola was detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, and the protein spot that exhibited high metase activity was identified using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. the identified gene produced a metase with a k(m) value for l-methionine (0.55mm) that is much lower  than those of metases previously identified in the other organisms. this result suggests that t. denticola is an important producer of methyl mercaptan in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == scaling and root planing, systemic metronidazole and professional plaque removal  in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in a brazilian population ii--microbiological results.
AB  == objective: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (srp) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned  in four treatment groups, a control (c, n=10) that received srp and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: t1 (n=12): srp and metronidazole (m, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; t2 (n=12): srp, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (pc) and placebo; and t3 (n=10): srp, m and pc. subgingival  plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. results: the mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. counts (x 10(5)+/-sem) of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella  forsythensis and treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups t2 and  t3. levels of beneficial species, such as some actinomyces species, veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (t3). mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group t3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group t2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group t1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group c (ns). proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups t2 and t3. conclusions: all treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.

TI  == pro- versus anti-inflammatory cytokine profile in african children with acute oro-facial noma (cancrum oris, noma).
AB  == fresh noma is a severe orofacial necrosis with an astonishingly rapid development. it is seen mainly in malnourished children less than 4 years old from developing countries. cytokines play a central role in oral mucosal inflammation. we therefore studied the relevance of circulating cytokines to noma, and the key microorganisms associated with the lesion. nigerian village children with acute noma (n=68) and their neighborhood village (n=63) as well as  urban (n=45) counterparts of comparable age and free of overt infections were evaluated for serum cytokine levels by elisa. oral bacteria were studied by polymerase chain reaction. evaluation of random cases of the village and noma children showed marked depletion (p<0.05 or 0.001) of the plasma antioxidant micronutrients (retinol, ascorbic acid, zinc) as well as albumin and blood hemoglobin in the latter, relative to the former group. concentrations of the circulating, pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-18, il-6, il-12, il-8, ifn-gamma) and the soluble inhibitors (tnfr-p55, tnfr-p75 and il-1ra) were significantly higher  (p<0.01 or 0.001) in noma children than in the healthy urban children, but less so when compared to their neighborhood village counterparts. the increase in levels of the anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokines (il-4, il-10 and tgf-beta) was less marked relative to the pro-inflammatory cytokines. bacteria observed at  the highest frequencies in noma lesions were p. intermedia (83%), t. forsythensis (83%), p. gingivalis (50%), c. rectus (50%) and t. denticola (50%). we conclude that noma is an immunopathological response to potent bacterial factors resulting in uncontrolled production of cytokines and possibly other, still unknown, inflammatory mediators.

TI  == mechanisms of porphyromonas gingivalis-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in endothelial cells.
AB  == monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) is expressed in vascular endothelial cells of inflamed gingival tissues and plays an important role in periodontal pathogenesis. endothelial cells produce high levels of mcp-1 in response to porphyromonas gingivalis, an important periodontal pathogen. the present study investigated the mechanisms involved in mcp-1 production by human umbilical vein  endothelial cells (huvec) following infection with p. gingivalis. in contrast to  p. gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus only weakly stimulated mcp-1 production while treponema denticola could not induce mcp-1 in huvec. the mcp-1 production was independent of endogenous interleukin (il)-1alpha as il-1 receptor antagonist treatment did not reduce mcp-1 production by p. gingivalis. meanwhile, antioxidant treatment and inhibition of nad(p)h oxidase significantly reduced mcp-1 production. pharmacological inhibition of p38 mitogen-associated protein (map) kinase, c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk), nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) or activator protein-1 (ap-1) also substantially attenuated p. gingivalis-induced mcp-1 expression by huvec. indeed, activation of nf-kappab and ap-1 was observed  in p. gingivalis-infected huvec. these results suggest that mcp-1 expression is upregulated in p. gingivalis-infected endothelial cells via reactive oxygen species, p38 map kinase, jnk, nf-kappab, and ap-1.

TI  == quantitative detection of volatile sulfur compound- producing microorganisms in oral specimens using real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: it is well-known that some periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus or tan. forsythensis), and treponema denticola, actively produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs), such as h2s and ch3sh. we previously reported a qualitative relationship between periodontopathic bacteria and vscs; however, a quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria in oral specimens is required for further characterization of the relationship between oral bacteria and vscs. in this study, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing bacteria in oral specimens. subjects and methods: specimens were collected from 22 patients who visited the preventive dentistry and breath odor clinic of kyushu dental college. a real-time pcr assay using the taqman system, based on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of taq polymerase, was employed for the quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria that produce vscs. results: using real-time pcr, we performed a quantitative analysis of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, tan. forsythia, and t. denticola in the saliva, on the tongue coat, and in the subgingival plaque of patients with oral malodor. conclusion: real-time pcr using the taqman system  can be used for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing oral bacteria.

TI  == detection of dna from periodontal pathogenic bacteria in biofilm obtained from waterlines in dental units.
AB  == direct person-to-person transmission of periodontal bacteria through saliva has recently been widely reported and dental units have been demonstrated to retract  saliva from patients under treatment and to release it into the mouths of subjects undergoing the next operation. in this study the presence of a group of  periodontal pathogenic bacteria inside waterlines in dental units was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based methods. briefly, 18 dental units of three different manufacturers were studied. dental units were divided into two groups according to their prevalent use in routine practice. the first group consisted of nine dental units characterized by the frequent use of high-speed dental hand-pieces directly inside the mouth and in contact with patients' saliva. the second group, as a control, consisted of nine dental units  where high-speed dental hand-pieces were not in use. a one cm section of the waterline tubing connected to the high-speed hand-piece was removed from each dental unit to evaluate the presence of dna of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola. two specimens were positive for prevotella intermedia dna. all the positive results were from samples obtained from dental units categorised in the first group. these findings clearly suggest  that dental units have the potential to transmit periodontal pathogens. manufacturers should be invited to design dental units that incorporate automated devices to disinfect duwls between patients with minimal effort by dental staff.

TI  == periodontal diseases: microbiological considerations.
AB  == the location of plaque-associated gingivitis at the gingival portion of the tooth plays an essential role in its genesis. however, at times local and other host response modifying factors also have an influence. the pathogeny of periodontitis is more complex. the microorganisms that comprise subgingival plaque are capable  of acting directly on periodontal tissues or of modifying the host response, whereas the participation of the plaque per se (normal, decreased, or increased)  is as decisive as the action of the bacteria themselves in the emergence of the disease. different types of periodontitis are associated with specific microorganisms. the most periodontopathogenic are a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis. periodontitis as a whole, represent the source of complications such as root caries, endoperiodontal processes and periodontal abscesses. they are associated with various illnesses such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and respiratory infections, amongst others, as well as pathological oral halitosis. the different modalities of pcr are particularly important in the microbiological diagnosis of periodontitis, although on the negative side of things, it must be pointed out that in vitro sensitivity studies cannot be performed using this technique. first line antibiotic treatment of periodontitis  includes amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid, metronidazole (associated or not with amoxicillin) and clindamycin.

TI  == oral flora in the age of molecular biology.
AB  == the present work describes the fundamental aspects of the molecular methods that  are applied to oral microbiology: probes, pcr, multiple real time pcr, 16s rdna,  and proteomics. likewise, it presents the results obtained by applying these methods to the study of the bacterial flora encountered inside the mouth. by identifying 16s rdna, up to 132 known species and 215 new, unknown phylotypes have been detected inside patients s periodontal pockets. we are currently using  a commercial system based on multiple pcr (genomic amplification), followed by reverse hybridization to detect the five species known to cause periodontal disease. we also summarize the findings derived from the application of proteomic techniques to the study of odontologic infections pathogenesis and from the use of molecular methods in the study of resistance to antimicrobial agents. finally, it puts forth the problems that remain unsolved with respect to oral flora and the treatment of odontogenic infections. traditional culture methods continue to  be indispensable, as they make it possible to later work with the cultured microorganisms.

TI  == detection frequency of periodontitis-associated bacteria by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival and supragingival plaque of periodontitis and healthy subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the detection frequencies of 25 bacterial species in subgingival and supragingival plaque of 18 untreated periodontitis subjects and 12 periodontally healthy subjects. genomic dna was extracted from subgingival and supragingival plaque samples, and bacterial detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction of the 16s rrna genes. fourteen bacteria showed no relationship with periodontitis, and 11 of these 14 species were frequently detected (> or =50%) in subgingival plaque in both periodontitis and healthy subjects. nine bacteria such as eubacterium saphenum, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola seemed to be related to periodontitis; their  detection frequencies in subgingival plaque samples were higher in periodontitis  than in healthy subjects, but these differences were not statistically significant by multiple comparisons (0.002< or =p<0.05). two species (mogibacterium timidum and porphyromonas gingivalis) were detected significantly  more frequently in subgingival plaque of periodontitis subjects than of healthy subjects (p<0.002), with p. gingivalis being detected only in periodontitis subjects, suggesting that these two species are closely related to periodontitis. there were no significant differences in the detection frequencies of the 25 bacteria between subgingival and supragingival plaque, suggesting that the bacterial flora of supragingival plaque reflects that of subgingival plaque.

TI  == contribution of periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa analyzed with real-time pcr to oral malodor.
AB  == oral malodor is considered to originate primarily from tongue microbiota populations. however, the relationship between oral malodor and tongue microbiota remains unclear. in this study, tongue periodontal pathogens were analyzed via real-time pcr, and the association between oral malodor and tongue periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola, was examined. the subject population consisted of 29 individuals with and 10 healthy persons without oral malodor. oral malodor was assessed by organoleptic test and volatile sulfur compound (vsc) levels as measured by gas chromatography. real-time pcr was conducted for anaerobes in tongue biofilm samples employing a lightcycler system; furthermore, bacterial proportion served as a quantitative parameter. among the five anaerobes, only t. forsythia displayed higher proportions in malodor subjects than corresponding values in healthy controls. proportions of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens correlated strongly with hydrogen sulfide concentration. proportions of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens also exhibited strong correlation with methyl mercaptan concentration. the correlation coefficient between the proportion of the total of the five anaerobes and total vsc level (r = 0.88) was greater than that between bacterial proportion and organoleptic score (r = 0.29). when a linear regression analysis was performed utilizing the proportion of each of the five periodontal pathogens as an independent variable, the explanatory power of these independent variables revealed 81% for total vsc level and 16% for organoleptic score. these results suggest that these five periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa may contribute greatly to vsc production.

TI  == genetic analysis of treponema denticola atcc 35405 biofilm formation.
AB  == treponema denticola is a major aetiological organism implicated in periodontal disease. the interaction of t. denticola with other oral bacteria, in particular  porphyromonas gingivalis, in biofilm formation is thought to be an important step in the onset of periodontal disease. the interaction between t. denticola and p.  gingivalis has been examined using a panel of t. denticola mutants and their effects on mixed biofilm formation tested in a static biofilm model. t. denticola atcc 35405 did not form detectable biofilms on various inert surfaces. however, the spirochaete was demonstrated to form a biofilm with preattached p. gingivalis 381. t. denticola cfpa, which lacks the cytoplasmic filament, was unable to produce a mixed biofilm with p. gingivalis. a t. denticola flge mutant which lacks the flagella hook protein and is therefore non-motile displayed a reduced,  but readily detectable, ability to form a mixed biofilm as did the t. denticola mutant which does not possess the major outer sheath protein (msp). the t. denticola lrra mutant was only moderately defective in forming mixed biofilms with p. gingivalis. however, the t. denticola methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (dmca) did not appear to play a major role in mixed biofilm formation. in contrast, t. denticola lacking the prtp protein for prolyl-phenylalanine-specific protease, showed an increased ability to form mixed biofilms and a prolonged viability in the biofilm.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chilean patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: an association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. a study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in chileans residing in santiago. methods: twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (pd) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (al) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a  history of periodontal therapy were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the microbial data of the chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from boston, massachusetts. since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for  each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean pd, gender, and smoking status. results: each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. with the exception of prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), and treponema denticola as well as fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros, and treponerma socranskii. sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between chilean and  u.s. subjects. red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the  chileans, while the actinomyces were higher in the u.s. subjects. conclusions: the composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.

TI  == changes in oral microbial profiles after periodontal treatment as determined by molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes.
AB  == terminal rflp (t-rflp) analysis was used to investigate changes in the oral microbiota in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from one patient with aggressive periodontitis (subject a) and two patients with chronic periodontitis  (subjects b and c) before and 3 months after periodontal treatment. substantial changes in the t-rflp patterns of subgingival plaque samples of subjects b and c  were noted after 3 months of improved oral hygiene and full-mouth supra- and subgingival scaling and root planing. however, there was little change in the subgingival microbiota of subject a. although the proportions of terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) larger than 1000 bp were notable in the t-rflp patterns generated after digestion with hhai of the samples from two subjects before treatment (subject b, 35.5 %; subject c, 29.6 %), the proportions of these t-rfs were significantly reduced or not detected after treatment (subject b, none; subject c, 4.1 %). real-time pcr showed a significant change in the proportions of target bacteria in subgingival plaque samples of subject b. after  3 months, the porphyromonas gingivalis population was markedly reduced (3.1 x 10(-3) %), whereas the proportion of porphyromonas gingivalis before treatment was 7.6 %. the proportions of tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola and treponema socranskii were also markedly diminished after treatment. similarly, the proportion of the t-rf presumed to represent porphyromonas gingivalis was 5.9 % and became undetectable after 3 months. analysis of 16s rrna gene clone libraries from subgingival plaque samples of subject b before and after treatment showed a notable change in the subgingival microbiota. these results were in agreement with the t-rflp analysis data and showed that the t-rfs larger than 1000 bp represent peptostreptococcus species. our results indicate that t-rflp analysis is useful for evaluation of the effects of medical treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == quadrant root planing versus same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological findings.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that over a period of 6 months, same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) resulted in greater reductions in the detection frequency of five putative periodontal pathogens compared with quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) in chronic periodontitis patients. materials and methods: forty patients were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups. the fm-srp group received full-mouth scaling and root planing completed within the same day, while the q-srp group received quadrant root planing at 2-weekly intervals over four consecutive sessions. selected-site analyses were performed on the deepest site in each quadrant before and after therapy, at approximately 3 and 6 months from baseline (r1 and r2) and clinical indices were recorded with an electronic pressure-sensitive probe. in addition, subgingival plaque samples were collected  from these sites at baseline (bas), at reassessment 1 (r1), approximately 6 weeks after the completion of therapy and at reassessment 2 (r2), 6 months from baseline. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in plaque. results: both therapies resulted in significant improvements in all clinical indices both  at r1 and r2. a marked reduction in the presence of all candidate periodontal pathogens was noted after both treatment modalities, reaching statistical significance for the majority of the test organisms. these improvements were maintained over a period of 6 months. when the two treatment groups were compared, a significantly higher percentage of q-srp patients was positive for p. intermedia at r1 compared with fm-srp patients (p<0.05). in addition, a greater reduction in the patient prevalence for t. denticola was found for the fm-srp group than the q-srp group at r1 and r2 from baseline (p<0.005), but the significance of this is questionable given the skewed detection frequency of this organism at baseline between the two treatments (p<0.01). conclusion: this study  failed to confirm that same-day fm-srp resulted in greater microbiological improvements compared with q-srp at 2-weekly intervals over a 6-month period, as  determined by pcr.

AB  == backgrounds/aims: the aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical, radiological and microbiological response to the local delivery of tetracycline (te) of sites  with persistent periodontal lesions. materials and methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. nineteen patients with at least four bilateral pockets 4-5 mm and bleeding on probing (bop) were treated with scaling and root planing (srp) plus te fibres (test sites) or with srp alone (control sites). clinical and radiological measurements were taken at baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-operatively. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, at fibres removal, 6 and 12 months following treatment and analysed by polymerase chain reaction. results: both treatments yielded a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction of probing depth (2.05 and 1.21 mm), gain of clinical attachment level (1.71 and 0.53 mm) and reduction of bop scores (23.68% and 57.89%) for te and srp groups, respectively, when comparing 12-month data with baseline. the differences between two groups were significant. the prevalence of  treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus decreased after therapy in both groups but only in the test sites actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were not yield detected. the pathogens could be eliminated  from five periodontal pockets by srp alone, while 21 te sites were not recolonized at 12 months. conclusions: srp plus te fibres gave the greatest advantage in the treatment of periodontal persistent lesions at least 12 months following treatment.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) and quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) resulted in variations in the systemic humoral immune response dynamics (antibody titres and avidity) during active treatment and 3 and 6 months post-therapy. materials and methods: forty patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups and received either scaling and root planing quadrant by quadrant at 2-weekly intervals (q-srp group) or same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp group). clinical measurements and serum samples were obtained at baseline and approximately 6 weeks after the last clinical intervention (r1) and 6 months after the initiation of therapy (r2). furthermore, serum samples were obtained from each patient undergoing therapy (q-srp and fm-srp) at 3 bi-weekly instances so as to determine the short-term effects of each session of scaling and root planing on the dynamics of the humoral immune response. serum antibody titre was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and antibody avidity was measured by thiocyanate dissociation against five putative periodontal pathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis; actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; prevotella intermedia; treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus. results: both therapies resulted in similar antibody titre reductions against the majority of the organisms tested and although there was a distinct trend for antibody avidity to increase following therapy, this was not found to be statistically significant, reflecting marked inter-individual variation. in addition, no evidence emerged from this study to support increased antibody titres following the active phases of both treatment approaches due to an inoculation effect. nevertheless, significant short-term increases in antibody avidity to most test bacteria were noted for both treatment strategies. conclusion: both therapies were associated with a reduction in antibody titres and an increase in the binding ability or avidity of antibodies, but there was a marked inter-subject variability and statistical significance was reached for only some of the test bacteria. no significant differences in the humoral antibody dynamics were found  between the two treatment approaches.

AB  == bacterial effects on in vitro mineralization of human periodontal fibroblasts (hpf) have not yet been examined in great detail. in our study, we investigated the effects of soluble extracts of the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and, treponema denticola on cell proliferation, mineralization, as well as on osteoblastic markers present in hpf cultured in vitro, such as alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity and collagen content. periodontal fibroblasts stimulated by b-glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid and dexamethasone (bad) or by dexamethasone and ascorbic acid (da) were compared to unstimulated cells. during the cultivation period, the stimulation of hpf by combined dexamethasone and ascorbic acid (da) had a strong inductive effect on proliferation, alp activity and collagen formation. the extracts obtained from the periodontal pathogens had a suppressing effect on the proliferation rate of hpf. the extracts from p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola caused a decrease in alp activity within 24 h of application. while extracts obtained from p. gingivalis and b. forsythus induced a reduction in collagen content in bad- and da-stimulated hpf cells, t. denticola extracts led to an increase in collagen. our data suggest that specific periodontopathic bacteria may suppress tissue regeneration in vivo not only by activating host defense mechanisms but also directly via a suppression of growth and differentiation of hpf and a reduction in the extracellular collagen matrix. for the process of pocket formation, not even the direct influence of viable bacteria seems to be necessary. additionally, long-distance effects of bacteria harboured in periodontal pockets or in root canals may be of importance.

TI  == binding of porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae to treponema denticola dentilisin.
AB  == treponema denticola has been reported to coaggregate with porphyromonas gingivalis and localize closely together in matured subgingival plaque. in this study of the interaction of t. denticola with p. gingivalis, the p. gingivalis fimbria-binding protein of t. denticola was identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by a ligand overlay assay with p. gingivalis fimbriae, and was determined to be dentilisin, a chymotrypsin-like proteinase of t. denticola. the binding was further demonstrated with a ligand overlay assay using an isolated gst fusion dentilisin construct. our results suggest that p. gingivalis fimbriae and t. denticola dentilisin are implicated in the coaggregation of these bacteria.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == enzymatic degradation of collagen-guided tissue regeneration membranes by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == bacterial infection in the vicinity of guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes was shown to have a negative effect on the clinical outcomes of this increasingly used technique. several oral and specifically periodontal bacteria were shown to adhere to such membranes in vivo and in vitro with a higher affinity to membranes constructed from collagen. the present study examined the role of periodontal bacteria and their enzymes in the degradation of commercially used collagen membranes. degradation of two collagen membranes [biomend (calcitek, colla-tec inc., plainsboro, nj) and bio-gide (geistlich biomaterials,  wolhousen, switzerland)] labeled by fluorescein isothiocyanate was examined by measuring soluble fluorescence. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and their enzymes were evaluated. collagenase from clostridium hystolyticum was used as a positive control. while whole cells of p. gingivalis were able to degrade both types of membranes, t. denticola could degrade bio-gide membranes only and a. actinomycetemcomitans whole cells could degrade none of the membranes. fractionation of p. gingivalis cells revealed that cell membrane associated proteases were responsible for the degradation of the two collagen membranes. in t. denticola, the purified major phenylalanine protease was found to be responsible for the degradation of bio-gide membranes. these results suggest that proteolytic bacterial enzymes may  take part in the degradation of collagen barrier membranes used for guided tissue regeneration.

TI  == inhibitory effect of procyanidin oligomer from elm cortex on the matrix metalloproteinases and proteases of periodontopathogens.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate a partially purified extract (elm extract) from the ulmi cortex (ulmi macrocarpa hance) and its active ingredient, a mix of procyanidin oligomers (3 to 12 flavan-3-ol monomers, an average molecular weight of 1,518 with an average polymerization degree of 5.3) for a possible inhibitory effect against proteases. background: host-derived matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and bacterial proteases play important roles in  the gingival tissue destruction that is a characteristic of periodontitis. the inhibitors of these proteases may be developed into therapeutic agents against periodontitis. methods: the inhibitory effects were assessed by gelatin zymography. the mmps tested were originated from the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) of adult periodontitis patients and from the conditioned media of cultured  periodontal ligament (pdl) cells, which provided the prommp-2 and activated mmp-2 when treated with a periodontopathogen, treponema lecithinolyticum. bacterial enzymes tested were secreted forms from two major periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. in addition, the inhibitory effects on trypsin-like enzymes from these two periodontopathogens were assayed by the n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide (bana) test. results: the elm extract  and the procyanidin oligomer (100-1,000 microg/ml) exhibited potent inhibitory effects on the mmps in gcf (chiefly mmp-8 and mmp-9), the pro and active forms of mmp-2, and secreted and trypsin-like enzymes from t. denticola and p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that elm cortex should be considered as a potential agent against periodontal diseases, due to its inhibitory action on mmps and the proteases of periodontopathogens.

TI  == accidentally induced periodontitis in primary dentition: longitudinal examinations of periodontal bacteria and clinical conditions.
AB  == periodontitis is very rare in the primary dentition although it can be accidentally induced in young children. the purpose of this study was to describe a case of periodontitis in a 4-year-old child, which was accidentally induced by  insertion of small plastic tubes into the dental cervix of the primary incisors during play, and to discuss the clinical, radiographic, and microbiological findings. removal of the plastic tubes resulted in resolution of the periodontal  condition. prevotella nigrescens and campylobacter rectus were detected in subgingival plaque samples from the affected teeth at every examination, whereas  porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and bacteroides forsythus were never found during the two-year observation period. the clinical and microbiological results suggest that the type of periodontitis caused by such an incidence is not progressive, unlike other periodontal diseases such as prepubertal and juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == role for recombinant gamma-glutamyltransferase from treponema denticola in glutathione metabolism.
AB  == volatile sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s), have been implicated in the development of periodontal disease. glutathione is an important thiol source for h(2)s production in periodontal pockets. our recent studies have delineated a pathway of glutathione metabolism in treponema denticola that releases h(2)s. in this pathway, gamma-glutamyltransferase (ggt) has been proposed to catalyze the first step of glutathione degradation. we have cloned the gene of ggt from t. denticola, which contains an open reading frame of 726 bp encoding a protein of 241 amino acids. transformation of this gene into escherichia coli led to the expression of a recombinant protein. after purification by chromatography, the recombinant protein showed enzymatic activity typical of ggt, catalyzing the degradation of na-gamma-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline (gna) and the hydrolysis of glutathione, releasing glutamic acid or glutamine and cysteinylglycine. l-cysteine is not a substrate of ggt. importantly, gna, when added to t. denticola, was able to compete with glutathione and inhibit the production of h(2)s, ammonia, and pyruvate. this was accompanied by the suppression of hemoxidative and hemolytic activities of the bacteria. purified ggt was inactivated by tlck (nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) and proteinase k treatment. however, higher enzymatic activity was demonstrated in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol. our further experiments showed that the addition of recombinant ggt to porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium without significant glutathione-metabolizing capacity, drastically increased the utilization of glutathione by the bacterium, producing h(2)s, ammonia, and pyruvate. this was again accompanied by enhanced bacterial hemoxidative and hemolytic activities. together, the results suggest an important role for ggt in glutathione metabolism in oral bacteria.

TI  == the relationship of oral malodor in patients with or without periodontal disease.
AB  == background: halitosis has been correlated with the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds (vsc) produced in the oral cavity by metabolic activity of bacteria colonizing the periodontal area and the dorsum of the tongue. the aim of this study was to determine whether there is some relationship between the presence of n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-2-napthylamide (bana)-positive species treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus and clinical and oral malodor parameters. methods: twenty-one subjects (21 to 59 years old) with probing depths (pd) > 3.0 mm and 20 subjects (21 to 63 years old) with pd < or = 3.0 mm (controls) participated. the quality of the mouth air was assessed organoleptically, and a portable sulfide monitor was used to measure the concentration of vsc. clinical parameters, plaque index (pi) and gingival index (gi), were obtained from 6 teeth. samples for bana test were taken from the dorsal surface of the tongue, saliva, and the 6 reference teeth. results: the scores of pi, gi, subgingival samples that tested positive for bana hydrolyzing species, organoleptic ratings, and vsc values were significantly higher in the subjects with pd > 3.0 mm (p < 0.01, mann-whitney u test). there was a correlation between bana hydrolysis by subgingival plaque bacteria and vsc values (r = 0.55, p < 0.01), and between gi and vsc values (r = 0.48, p < 0.05) in patients with pd > 3.0 mm. there was no significant correlation between these parameters in the control group. conclusion: these results confirm that the bana  hydrolyzing bacteria in the subgingival plaque are an important source of malodor production in the oral cavity.

TI  == transmission of periodontal disease-associated bacteria from teeth to osseointegrated implant regions.
AB  == purpose: the presence of periodontopathic bacteria is a risk factor for peri-implantitis. the present study examined colonization by periodontopathic bacteria and their transmission from periodontal pockets to osseointegrated implant sulcus. materials and methods: plaque samples were collected from 105 sites in the 15 patients who participated in the study. colonization by these bacteria was examined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and culture. the transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from periodontal sites of natural teeth to the implant sulcus was analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: the pcr detection rates of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola were 80.0%, 53.3%, 46.7%, 60.0% and 40.0%, respectively. colonizations by p gingivalis and a actinomycetemcomitans were statistically correlated with periodontal pockets and implant sulcus regions (p < .01). the pfge patterns of the p gingivalis strains isolated from each patient were identical, but differed from those from other patients. the pfge patterns of p intermedia strains were identical in 2 out of 3 patients. discussion: these analyses indicated that there appeared to be transmission of p gingivalis and p intermedia from the periodontal pocket to the peri-implant region. conclusion: elimination of these periodontal pathogens from the patient's oral cavity before  administering dental implant treatment may inhibit colonization by these pathogens and reduce the risk of peri-implantitis.

TI  == comparison of microbial cultivation and a commercial pcr based method for detection of periodontopathogenic species in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == objectives: microbiological laboratory procedures are involved in diagnosis and therapy control of progressive and refractory forms of periodontitis. in recent years techniques have been developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. the purpose of this study was to validate the commercially available micro-dent(r) test which employs probes for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus and t. denticola. methods: 122 plaque samples obtained from periodontal pockets with various depths from 33 early onset periodontitis (eop) patients and 15 periodontally healthy subjects were analysed by cultivation and the microdent(r) kit. results: both cultivation and the nucleic acid based assay showed a positive correlation of pocket depth with the frequency and quantity of periodontopathogenic species. t. denticola was found only in pockets  > 4 mm in eop patients. comparison of the two methods revealed that the microdent(r) kit identified both p. gingivalis and b. forsythus more often than did the cultivation method. conclusions: nucleic acid techniques should replace cultivation methods as gold standard in microbiological diagnosis of progressive  periodontitis. the micro-dent(r) kit can be recommended for microbiological laboratories analysing subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == microbiological findings and host response in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to characterise microbiota and inflammatory host response around implants and teeth in patients with peri-implantitis. we included 17 partly edentulous patients with a total of 98 implants, of which 45 showed marginal bone loss of more than three fixture threads after the first year of loading. nineteen subjects with stable marginal tissue conditions served as controls. oral hygiene, gingival inflammation, and probing pocket depth were evaluated clinically at teeth and implants. microbiological and crevicular fluid  samples were collected from five categories of sites: 1) implants with peri-implantitis (pi), 2) stable implants (si) in patients with both stable and peri-implantitis implants, 3) control implants (ci) in patients with stable implants alone, 4) teeth in patients (tp) and 5) controls (tc). crevicular fluid  from teeth and implants was analysed for elastase activity, lactoferrin and il-1  beta concentrations. elastase activity was higher at pi than at ci in controls. lactoferrin concentration was higher at pi than at si in patients with peri-implantitis. higher levels of both lactoferrin and elastase activity were found at pi than at teeth in patients. the concentrations of il-1 beta were about the same in the various sites. microbiological dna-probe analysis revealed a putative periodontal microflora at teeth and implants in patients and controls. patients with peri-implantitis harboured high levels of periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. these findings indicate a site-specific inflammation rather than a patient-associated specific host response.

TI  == clinical, genetic and microbiological findings in a brazilian family with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background/aim: aggressive periodontitis comprises a group of rapidly progressive forms of periodontitis. besides bacteria, a high level of subject susceptibility  must be involved in the expression of disease. in the present study, we report the clinical, microbiological and genetic profile of a 14-individual family with  aggressive periodontitis. method: pcr was utilized to detect pathogenic bacteria  of affected sites. dna was obtained from epithelial cells through a mouthwash with 3% glucose and scrapping of the oral mucosa. rflp-pcr was used to analyze cytokine genetic polymorphisms. results: localized aggressive periodontitis was diagnosed for an 18-year-old systemically healthy non-smoking proband, with siblings displaying aggressive periodontitis. bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola were the most frequent pathogens. the proband presented actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans and detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. allele 2 of il-1alpha (-889) polymorphism was found in all individuals as well as allele 1 of the il-1beta (+3953) gene. alleles 1 and 2 (50 % each) of il-1beta (-511), allele 1 of tnf-alpha (-308) and allele 2 (in homo or heterozygosity) of il-rn (intron 2) gene were present. conclusion: the results show that the present microbiological  and genetic parameters were not relevant for the prediction of periodontitis susceptibility in this family.

TI  == maternal periodontitis and prematurity. part ii: maternal infection and fetal exposure.
AB  == clinical data from the first 812 deliveries from a cohort study of pregnant mothers entitled oral conditions and pregnancy (ocap) demonstrate that both antepartum maternal periodontal disease and incidence/progression of periodontal  disease are associated with preterm birth and growth restriction after adjusting  for traditional obstetric risk factors. in the current study we present measures  of maternal periodontal infection using whole chromosomal dna probes to identify  15 periodontal organisms within maternal periodontal plaque sampled at delivery.  in addition, maternal postpartum igg antibody and fetal exposure, as indexed by fetal cord blood igm level to these 15 maternal oral pathogens, was measured by whole bacterial immunoblots. the potential role of maternal infection with specific organisms within 2 bacterial complexes most often associated with periodontitis, conventionally termed "orange" (campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia) and "red" (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola) complexes, respectively, to prematurity was investigated by relating the presence of oral infection, maternal igg, and fetal  cord igm, comparing full-term to preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks). the prevalence of 8 periodontal pathogens was similar among term and preterm mothers  at postpartum. there was a 2.9-fold higher prevalence of igm seropositivity for one or more organisms of the orange or red complex among preterm babies, as compared to term babies (19.9% versus 6.9%, respectively, p = 0.0015, chi square). specifically, the prevalence of positive fetal igm to c. rectus was significantly higher for preterm as compared to full-term neonates (20.0% versus  6.3%, p = 0.0002, as well as p. intermedia (8.8% versus 1.1%, p = 0.0003). a lack of maternal igg antibody to organisms of the red complex was associated with an increased rate of prematurity with an odds ratio (or) = 2.2; confidence interval  (ci) 1.48 to 3.79), consistent with the concept that maternal antibody protects the fetus from exposure and resultant prematurity. the highest rate of prematurity (66.7%) was observed among those mothers without a protective red complex igg response coupled with a fetal igm response to orange complex microbes (combined or 10.3; p < 0.0001). these data support the concept that maternal periodontal infection in the absence of a protective maternal antibody response is associated with systemic dissemination of oral organisms that translocate to the fetus resulting in prematurity. the high prevalence of elevated fetal igm to  c. rectus among premature infants raises the possibility that this specific maternal oral pathogen may serve as a primary fetal infectious agent eliciting prematurity.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

AB  == objectives: recent molecular approaches have revealed that fastidious organisms such as bacteroides forsythus and oral treponemes were frequently found in root canals with apical periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to identify the isolates of oral spirochetes at the species level in endodontic infections and to determine their association with b forsythus and porphyromonas gingivalis. study  design: seventy-nine teeth with apical periodontitis were selected for this study. after sampling from the root canals aseptically, polymerase chain reaction amplification for the 16s rrna gene was performed with eubacterial universal primers. subsequently, dot-blot hybridization was performed with 8 species-specific oligonucleotide probes. the microbial associations were analyzed by using the odds ratio. results: the most frequently found species was p gingivalis (27.4%), followed by treponema maltophilum (26%), b forsythus (16.4%), and treponema socranskii (2.7%). other treponemes, including treponema denticola, were not detected in our samples. significant microbial associations were identified between t maltophilum, b forsythus, and p gingivalis by performing analysis with the odds ratio. conclusion: our results indicate that t maltophilum should be included in etiologic studies of endodontic diseases.

AB  == sixty-five patients with generalised early-onset periodontitis (g-eop) (age range 16-42 years, 32 smokers and 33 non-smokers) were assessed for antibody titres and avidity to a panel of five suspected periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus). thirty-four of these patients were untreated (17 smokers and 17 non-smokers), and thirty-one were in the maintenance phase of periodontal therapy (15 smokers and 16 non-smokers). previous studies have investigated the effect of smoking on igg levels in periodontitis patients in the context of the more extensive periodontal destruction seen in smokers. based on this literature our hypothesis was that smokers would have depressed serum igg levels directed against recognised periodontal pathogens compared with non-smokers. antibody titres were measured by elisa deploying fixed whole cells as coating. the igg response was detected with  biotin-anti-human igg and avidin-peroxidase; avidity was determined by elution with ammonium thiocyanate. median titres to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and t. denticola were significantly lower in maintenance patient smokers (p= 0.02, 0.02 and 0.002 respectively) but not in untreated patients. avidity to p. gingivalis was also lower in smoking maintenance patients (p = 0.003) but not in untreated patients. these findings may imply some interruption  of immune maturation in smokers following periodontal treatment.

TI  == clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  == background: this is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. in this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (scn, kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (cn). methods: the scn patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with cn had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. results: by a pcr-based method, prevotella nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the scn patient and p. intermedia, c.  rectus, c. gingivalis, and c. sputigena in the cn patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and c. ochracea were not found in  either patient. conclusions: use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.

TI  == detection of putative oral pathogens in acute periradicular abscesses by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic  origin. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain  reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. porphyromonas endodontalis was found  in 70%, t. denticola in 50%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis. prevotella nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == pcr detection of 5 putative periodontal pathogens in dental plaque samples from children 2 to 12 years of age.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus in plaque samples from 119 children, collected from their toothbrushes using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). method: the subjects  were 24, 83, and 12 children with healthy gingiva, gingivitis, and periodontitis, respectively, ranging in age from 2-12 years old. plaque samples were collected from all erupted teeth sites using a sterile toothbrush. the mean concentration of dna recovered from the plaque samples was approximately 640 microg/ml, which was deemed sufficient for performing a pcr-based survey. results: the prevalence  by pcr in healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis subjects was 0.0%, 6.0% and 25.0% for p. intermedia, 45.8%, 79.5% and 50.0% for p. nigrescens, 33.3%, 63.9% and 58.3% for b. forsythus, 0.0%, 18.1% and 16.7% for t. denticola, and 100% in duplicate for c. rectus, respectively. conclusion: our survey indicated that p. intermedia and t. denticola were more associated with periodontal diseases, b. forsythus and p. nigrescens had a moderate prevalence in all clinical groups, while c. rectus were the most commonly detected species in the oral cavities of children suggesting establishment in their early years.

TI  == relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background: the relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. method: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. results: greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. members of the orange and red complexes including e. nodatum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, p. intermedia, p. micros, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly more  prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. the difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). the difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. conclusions: the major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking  history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. the greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == "red complex" (bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola) in endodontic infections: a molecular approach.
AB  == objective: the "red complex," composed of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola, is implicated in severe forms of periodontal diseases. the purpose of this study was to assess the occurrence of the red complex in root canal infections through the use of a sensitive technique-the 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). study design: samples were obtained from 50 necrotic pulps with periradicular pathosis. ten cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed with a pcr-based identification assay. results: at least 1 member of the red complex was found in 33 of 50 cases. t denticola, p gingivalis, and b forsythus were detected in 44%, 30%, and 26% of the cases, respectively. the red  complex was found in 4 of 50 cases. no particular signs or symptoms were associated with the presence of these bacterial species. conclusions: despite what is indicated in reports with respect to marginal periodontitis, red complex  bacteria-either singularly or collectively-was not associated with any particular pattern of clinical symptoms. however, because the bacterial species from the red complex are recognized oral pathogens, their occurrence in root canal infections  suggests that they may play a role in the pathogenesis of periradicular diseases.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == rapid detection and quantification of five periodontopathic bacteria by real-time pcr.
AB  == the quantity of periodontopathic bacteria in plaque samples is an important determinant for understanding the etiologic role of bacteria. the real-time pcr method was used to detect and quantify periodontopathic bacteria, such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii, in saliva and subgingival plaque samples. there was good agreement between the results of conventional pcr and real-time pcr methods. using the lightcycler system we were  able to determine the amount of periodontopathic bacteria within an hour. the real-time pcr method was linear for samples containing from 10(3) to more than 10(8) cells (r2 = 0.999). the application of the real-time pcr method should be useful in the rapid detection and quantification of periodontopathic bacteria in  clinical samples.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == adherence of periodontopathic bacteria to bioabsorbable and non-absorbable barrier membranes in vitro.
AB  == guided tissue regeneration (gtr) techniques are increasingly used for the treatment of periodontal defects, or in conjunction with dental implant procedures. as adhesion of bacteria to barrier membranes used in these techniques may lead to failure, a prerequisite for treatment success is an infection-free healing process. the present study examined the adhesion of 3 periodontal pathogenic bacteria: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis, to 3 barrier membranes: collagen, (biomend) ptfe, (tefgen-fd) and e-ptfe, (gore-tex). the membranes were incubated with 3[h]-thymidine labeled bacteria, and the number of adherent bacteria was calculated using a scintillation counter. the effect of albumin coating on bacterial adherence to the membranes was also studied. bacterial adherence to the membranes was further examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the results show that the adherence of all bacterial strains to collagen membranes was significantly higher than to the other membranes tested. precoating of the membranes with albumin did not change the bacterial adherence significantly. these findings are of importance in evaluating the ability of periodontal bacteria to colonize and infect different types of barrier membranes.

TI  == inability of intact cells of treponema denticola to degrade human serum proteins  iga, igg and albumin.
AB  == treponema denticola has been shown to be associated with periodontitis in man and animals. the organism ferments amino acids and thrives on the proteins in the periodontal pocket. accordingly, t. denticola possesses various proteolytic enzymes, including a chymotrypsin-like protease, capable of hydrolyzing a whole range of proteins, including immunoglobulins. yet, it is not clear whether the intact cells of t. denticola can degrade immunoglobulins and albumin. the purpose of this study was to clarify this point. three strains of t. denticola were cultured in liquid medium, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. protein degradation in cell suspensions was assayed by capillary electrophoresis and immunonephelometry. none of the t. denticola strains appeared to be able to degrade iga, igg, or albumin, while a strain of p. gingivalis completely hydrolyzed these proteins. the findings suggest that, in the periodontal pocket,  t. denticola depends on proteinases from other bacteria for utilization of the available serum proteins. this is in accordance with clinical data showing a close relationship between t. denticola and strongly proteolytic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus.

AB  == the effect of a polymicrobic infection employing treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis in the murine lesion model was used to determine the synergistic virulence of these two periodontopathic bacteria. at high doses of p. gingivalis w50, addition of t. denticola in the infection mixture had no effect on the formation and size of the spreading lesion caused by this microorganism. however, at low p. gingivalis challenge doses, t. denticola significantly enhanced the virulence of p. gingivalis compared with monoinfection of this microorganism. a potential role of the trypsin-like protease enzyme activity of p. gingivalis in this synergistic virulence was tested using p. gingivalis mutants deficient (i.e., bei) or devoid (i.e., ng4b19) of this protease activity. these findings demonstrated that t. denticola-p. gingivalis complexes exhibit enhanced virulence in this model and that even using a polymicrobic challenge infection, the trypsin-like protease activity was important to p. gingivalis virulence expression.

TI  == risk indicators for harboring periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the risk for harboring 6 putative periodontal pathogens in 4 selected periodontal pockets, in whole saliva, or in either site (i.e., orally) was determined in 52 caucasians, 49 african-americans, 48 asian-americans, and 50 hispanics living in  los angeles. 16s rrna pcr analysis assessed the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. step-wise  regression analysis determined the relationship between the occurrence of each organism and various explanatory variables (risk indicators). periodontal probing depth or disease severity was positively associated with all 6 study organisms. african-americans carried an increased risk for harboring p. gingivalis in saliva (odds ratio [or] 2.95) and orally (or 2.66), and a reduced risk for harboring t.  denticola orally (or 0.34). asian-americans showed an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 6.63) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 5.39), in saliva (or 5.74), and orally (or  5.81). hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 12.27) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 6.07), in saliva (or 8.72), and orally (or 7.98). age was positively associated with the prevalence of p. gingivalis in saliva (or 1.20) and orally (or 1.20), and of a. actinomycetemcomitans orally (or 1.18). the male  gender was a risk factor for harboring p. intermedia in periodontal pockets (or 2.40), in saliva (or 3.31), and orally (or 4.25), and for harboring p. nigrescens in saliva (or 2.85). the longer the subjects resided in the united states, the less likely a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected orally (or 0.82). former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (or 0.23). current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring t. denticola in periodontal pockets (or 4.61). the number of dental visits in the past 10 years was inversely related to the prevalence of p. intermedia orally (or 0.96). the prevalence of p. intermedia in saliva was positively associated with the length of time from the last dental visit (or 1.01). this study suggests that genetic and/or environmental factors predispose subjects to oral colonization by  putative periodontal pathogens.

AB  == during normal pregnancy, maternal hormones and locally acting cytokines play a key role in regulating the onset of labor, cervical ripening, uterine contraction, and delivery. maternal infections during pregnancy have been demonstrated to perturb this normal cytokine and hormone-regulated gestation, sometimes resulting in preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and preterm low birth weight (plbw), i.e., < 2,500 g and < 37 weeks of gestation. our research focus has been to determine whether periodontal infections can provide sufficient challenge to the mother to trigger plbw. new experiments from 48 case-control subjects have measured gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) levels of pge(2) and il-1-beta to determine whether mediator levels were related to current pregnancy outcome. in addition, the levels of 4 periodontal pathogens were measured by using microbe-specific dna probes. results indicate that gcf-pge(2) levels are significantly higher in plbw mothers, as compared with normal birth weight (nbw) controls (131.4 +/- 21.8 vs. 62.6 +/- 10.3 [mean +/- se ng/ml], respectively, at p = 0.02). furthermore, within primiparous plbw mothers, there was a significant inverse association between birth weight (as well as gestational age) and gcf-pge(2) levels at p = 0.023. these data suggest a dose-response relationship for increasing gcf-pge(2) as a marker of current periodontal disease activity and decreasing birth weight. microbial data indicate that 4 organisms associated with mature plaque and progressing periodontitis--bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and treponema denticola--were detected at higher levels in plbw mothers, as compared to nbw controls. these data suggest that biochemical measures of maternal periodontal status and oral microbial burden are associated  with current plbw.

TI  == crevicular fluid level of beta-glucuronidase in relation to clinical periodontal  parameters and putative periodontal pathogens in early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == analysis of beta-glucuronidase (betag) in the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) provides an indication of neutrophil influx into the crevicular environment. the  aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that: (1) betag is significantly elevated in individuals with early-onset periodontitis (eop) and that betag activity correlates with disease severity; and (2) betag level may reflect the local bacterial challenge in the gingival crevice. the study subjects consisted of a sub-sample of individuals examined in the national survey of oral health of  united states children, which was undertaken during the 1986/87 school year. a total of 249 individuals were selected based on presence or absence of clinical attachment loss at baseline. the individuals were examined a second time 6 years  later and the clinical attachment loss was assessed, and subgingival plaque and gcf were collected. the subjects were classified into 3 types of eop and a control group. betag activity in the gcf and the levels of 7 putative micro-organisms in the pocket were assessed. the generalized eop group had the highest betag activity, followed by the localized and incidental eop groups, and  the controls, respectively. there was a significant increase in betag activity with the increase in probing depth. also, sites with bleeding on probing had a significantly higher betag activity than sites without bleeding. however, the effect of gingival inflammation on betag activity was more evident in the generalized and localized eop groups. sites harboring high levels of one or more  of the micro-organisms tended to have high betag activity. there were moderate differences between the organisms with respect to their effect on betag activity, but sites with high numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, or treponema denticola also had the highest betag activity. the present findings  suggest that betag activity in gcf from patients with eop can be of value in the  early identification of individuals at higher risk of developing eop the findings also suggest that host mechanisms leading to higher betag activity in eop represent systemic responses and are only partly related to the presence of local factors at the site-level.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile of papillon-lefevre patients assessed by dna-probes.
AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == the utility of whole saliva to detect the oral presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study compared the presence of 6 periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and subgingival plaque of 202 subjects. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition. the kappa test revealed a fair agreement between the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples (kappa > 0.4). the mcnemar test showed that the differences between sample types were due to a more frequent detection of the 3 organisms in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01). prevotella nigrescens also was detected more frequently in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01; mcnemar  test). although little agreement between samples was found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus (kappa < or = 0.4), neither whole saliva nor pocket samples showed better detection for these 2 species (p < 0.01,  mcnemar test). the results indicate that whole saliva is superior to pooled periodontal pocket samples to detect p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola in the oral cavity. the detection of oral a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus with reasonably good accuracy may require  both whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples.

TI  == dentilisin activity affects the organization of the outer sheath of treponema denticola.
AB  == prolyl-phenylalanine-specific serine protease (dentilisin) is a major extracellular protease produced by treponema denticola. the gene, prtp, coding for the protease was recently cloned and sequenced (k. ishihara, t. miura, h. k.  kuramitsu, and k. okuda, infect. immun. 64:5178-5186, 1996). in order to determine the role of this protease in the physiology and virulence of t. denticola, a dentilisin-deficient mutant, k1, was constructed following electroporation with a prtp-inactivated dna fragment. no chymotrypsin-like protease activity was detected in the dentilisin-deficient mutant. in addition, the high-molecular-mass oligomeric protein characteristic of the outer sheath of  the organism decreased in the mutant. furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was decreased, and coaggregation of the mutant with fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced compared to that of the wild-type organism. the results obtained with a mouse abscess model system indicated that the virulence of the mutant was attenuated relative to that of the wild-type organism. these results suggest that dentilisin activity plays a major role in the structural organization of the outer sheath of t. denticola. the loss of dentilsin activity  and the structural change in the outer sheath affect the pathogenicity of t. denticola.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  == this investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. the % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. commonly detected species, such as actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. mean % of sites (+/-sem) colonized by bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. the odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when b. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. mean prevalence for porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2  (p<0.001) and for selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with pd 0-4 mm were analyzed. the data suggest an etiologic role for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and s. noxia in adult periodontitis.

TI  == association of oral spirochetes from sites of periodontal health with development of periodontitis.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the presence of disease-associated bacteria in health-associated plaque correlated with susceptibility to periodontitis over time. sites of periodontal health were identified in 65 adults. six months later (recall 1), plaque was collected from sites that remained in periodontal health, and specific bacteria were detected using monoclonal antibodies in a microscopic assay. the spirochete morphogroup was identified by phase contrast microscopy. the relationship between detection at recall 1 and development of periodontitis over two successive 6-month intervals (recalls 2 and 3) was evaluated by means of logistic regression using generalized estimating equations (gee), from which odds ratios (or) were estimated and tested for significance. significant relationships were defined as  those having ors with p < 0.05. ninety-three of 1,032 sites developed signs of early periodontitis over the 12-month interval between recall 1 and recall 3. the spirochete morphogroup (or = 3.13, p < 0.001) and pathogen-related oral spirochetes (pros) (or = 3.68, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with healthy sites that developed periodontitis. the association of treponema socranskii was not significant (or = 3.62, p = 0.0918). odds ratios for campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and porphyromonas gingivalis were less than 2.0 and not significant. treponema denticola was not detected in health-associated plaque from stable health sites and was detected in only three  sites that progressed to periodontitis. these findings indicate that the presence of pros and some unidentified spirochetes in health-associated plaque is associated with increased susceptibility to periodontitis.

TI  == oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of subjects with adult periodontitis who responded poorly to scaling and root planing.
AB  == in a previous report, it was shown that scaling and root planing (srp) decreased  mean pocket depth and attachment level in subjects with adult periodontitis, as well as the levels and prevalence of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. however, a subset of subjects in that study exhibited mean loss of attachment following srp. the purpose of the present investigation was to seek clinical and microbiological differences between subjects who responded well or poorly to srp. 57 subjects with adult periodontitis were treated by full-mouth srp under local anaesthetic. clinical assessments of plaque, redness, suppuration, bop, pocket depth and attachment level were made at 6 sites per tooth prior to and 3 months post-srp. attachment level measurements were repeated at each visit and differences in means between visits used to assess change. 18 subjects showed mean attachment loss 3 months post-srp (poor response group), while 39 showed mean attachment level gain (good  response group). the prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa in subgingival  plaque samples from the mesiobuccal site of each tooth (maximum 28 sites) in each subject prior to and 3 months post-srp were assessed using checker-board dna-dna  hybridization. the prevalence of each species was computed for each subject and averaged across subjects in the 2 treatment-response groups at each visit. differences between groups were sought using the mann-whitney test. there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 response groups in any clinical parameter prior to therapy. subjects in the good response group showed more attachment level gain at sites with baseline pocket depths of < 4 mm, 4-6 and > 6 mm than poor response subjects. of 40 species evaluated, a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus), t. denticola, c. gracilis and c. rectus were significantly higher and more prevalent pre-therapy in the good response subjects. mean attachment level change post srp could be predicted using multiple linear regression with a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) and t. denticola as the predictor variables (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.00001). sites that gained > or = 2  mm of attachment post therapy showed a significant decrease in the counts of p. gingivalis (7.5 +/- 3.5 to 0.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(5)), t. denticola (8.2 +/- 3.5 to 1.8 +/- 1.1 x 10(5)) and b. forsythus (11.1 +/- 5.7 to 0.3 +/- 0.2 x 10(5)). the data of the present investigation indicate that srp is most effective in subjects and  sites with high levels of the subgingival species that this therapy affects.

AB  == protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and  chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. the elastase-like activity was strongest in capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others  were greatest in capnocytophaga gingivalis. the latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease  activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to p. gingivalis. treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.

AB  == ninety-two subjects were tested before orthodontic mechanotherapy for the presence of three putative periodontopathogens-porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and bacteroides forsythus-with the bana test (perioscan oral-b). the sample ranged from 9 to 16 years, with a mean age of 13.1 years, and consisted of 51% girls and 49% boys; 48% african american, 46% white, 4% asian, and 2% hispanic. unlike other bana studies that examined children and adolescents with a 15-minute incubation time, this research used a 5-minute incubation time to increase the specificity and to reduce the false positives obtained from the perioscan cards. no statistically significant difference was found between the age, gender, or race of the patients and the levels of the three putative periodontopathogens. a friedman two-way analysis of variance assessed the bana levels for three groups of teeth: molars, incisors, and premolars. the central incisors and first molars had a significantly higher percentage of positive bana  readings than the first premolars at p < or = 0.05. the clinical importance of this finding has yet to be determined, however, because the central incisor and first molar are the first permanent teeth to erupt, a possible association between dental emergence time and the rate of infection with various organisms may be postulated. in a pilot study, 10 patients from a statistically comparable  pretreatment group were assessed longitudinally at two separate collection times  separated by 4 months. the wilcoxon signed rank test indicated no significant changes in these patients over the 4-month period.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult chinese: prevalence and relation to periodontal disease progression.
AB  == the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technology was used to study the epidemiology of 18 microbial species associated with various states of periodontal health and disease, in a sample of 148 chinese subjects never exposed to systematic dental therapeutic intervention, aged 30 to 39 and 50 to 59 years.  our aims were to: 1) describe the prevalence of these microorganisms; 2) correlate the microbiological and clinical profiles of the subjects; and 3) examine the association between the microbiological variables and the longitudinal changes of periodontal status that occurred over a preceding 10-year period. a maximum of 14 subgingival samples were obtained from each subject-1,864 in all. the frequency of occurrence of the 18 species examined was high in this chinese population, on both the subject and the tooth site level. however, all species were not found equally capable of reaching high numbers in the subgingival samples and, as a rule, colonized heavily only limited proportions of tooth sites within each mouth. there was a profound increase of certain species such as porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and bacteroides forsythus  in deep pockets or progressing sites. multivariate techniques using the subgingival profile could effectively discriminate between deep/shallow pockets and progressing/ stable tooth sites. the microbiological variables showed an enhanced discriminating potential when classifications were performed on the individual subject level. colonization by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and t. denticola at levels exceeding certain thresholds entailed a significantly increased probability (odds ratios > 4) for an individual subject to harbor deep pockets or progressing tooth sites.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == the effect of srp on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the effect of srp on clinical and microbiological parameters in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis (mean age 47 +/- 11 years). subjects were monitored clinically and microbiologically prior to and 3, 6 and 9 months after full-mouth srp under local anaesthesia. clinical assessments of plaque, redness, suppuration, bop, pocket depth and attachment level were made at 6 sites per tooth. the means of duplicate attachment level measurements taken at each visit were used to assess change between visits. clinical data were averaged within each subject and then averaged across subjects for each visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject at each visit. differences in clinical and microbiological parameters before and after srp were sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test or the quade test for more than 2 visits. overall, there was a mean gain in attachment level of 0.11 +/- 0.23 mm (range -0.53 to 0.64 mm) 3 months post-therapy. there was a significant decrease in the % of sites exhibiting gingival redness (68 to 57%) and bop (58 to 52%) as well as a mean (+/-sem) pocket depth (3.3 +/- 0.06 to 3.1 +/- 0.05 mm). sites with pre-therapy pocket depths of < 4 mm showed a non-significant increase in pocket depth and attachment level, 4.6 mm pockets showed a significant decrease in pocket depth and a non-significant gain in attachment post-therapy, while > 6 mm  pockets showed a significant decrease in pocket depth and attachment level measurements post-therapy. significant clinical improvements were seen in subjects who had never smoked or were past smokers but not in current smokers. mean prevalences and levels of p. gingivalis, t. denticola and b. forsythus were  significantly reduced after srp, while a. viscosus showed a significant increase  in mean levels. the mean decrease in prevalence of p. gingivalis was similar at all pocket depth categories, while b. forsythus decreased more at shallow and intermediate pockets and a. viscosus increased most at deep sites. p. gingivalis. b. forsythus and t. denticola were equally prevalent among current, past and never smokers pre-therapy, decreased significantly post-srp in never and past smokers but increased in current smokers. clinical improvement post-srp was accompanied by a modest change in the subgingival microbiota, primarily a reduction in p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola, suggesting potential targets for therapy and indicating that radical alterations in the subgingival microbiota may not be necessary or desirable in many patients.

TI  == in vitro models that support adhesion specificity in biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  == adhesion to adsorbed pellicles and interspecies co-adhesion to form plaque biofilms involve selective interactions of bacterial adhesins with specific receptors. our laboratory has devised in vitro assays for co-adhesion between actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis or porphyromonas gingivalis on saliva-coated mineral and hexadecane droplet substrata. p. gingivalis structures  significant for co-adhesion with a. naeslundii include surface vesicles and fimbriae. a family of arginine-specific cysteine proteinases in vesicles may be involved in adherence to bacteria, to host cells, and to matrix proteins. new research from several laboratories has found that such proteinases are processed  from genes encoding polyproteins containing both proteinase and hemagglutinin domains. in addition to enzyme-substrate recognition, bacterial adhesion is often determined by specific protein-peptide and lectincarbohydrate recognition. a. naeslundii--salivary prolinerich protein, s. gordonii--salivary alpha-amylase, and treponema denticola--matrix protein recognition are examples of the former. co-adhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis is an example of the latter. lactose can selectively desorb a. naeslundii cells from mixed biofilms with s. oralis, a  demonstration of the significance of specificity. although non-specific forces are probably secondary to stereochemical fit in determining the selective range of surfaces that bacteria have evolved to recognize and bind, they probably help  stabilize non-covalent bonds within aligned, complementary domains.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == similarities of periodontal clinical and microbiological parameters in mother-child pairs.
AB  == the aim of this study was to verify the association between children and their mothers (n = 28) for periodontal clinical and microbiological measures. periodontal clinical parameters (probing depth and bleeding on probing) were obtained from six reference teeth from each mother-child pair. in addition, subgingival plaque samples taken from the same reference teeth were collected and placed on the perioscan test for the detection of treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. there were statistically significant differences between children and mothers regarding probing depth; there was an overall tendency for mothers to exhibit average probing depths greater than their children. in contrast, if a child had a bleeding site, the respective site on the mother usually also bled on probing, implying that there was an association in terms of bleeding between the mother-child pairs. similar findings were observed for the perioscan test. it is concluded that the occurrence of bleeding and periodontal anaerobic infections (as determined by the perioscan test) were similar in reference teeth of mother-child pairs. these data suggest that parents with periodontal disease may serve as a reservoir of periodontopathic organisms for their children.

AB  == bodipy-alpha-casein is a new fluorescent protein substrate designed for fluorescence polarization studies to measure proteolytic activity at any ph over  the range from ph 2 to 11. kinetic protease assays in real-time were performed in 1 to 5 min using an fpm-1 fluorescence polarization instrument. a purified enzyme or bacterial culture was mixed with the bodipy-alpha-casein in a buffer of an appropriate ph and the decrease in fluorescence polarization was automatically recorded at 0.5-min intervals. the initial decrease in fluorescence polarization  with time was dependent on protease concentration. in 3-min assays at 37 degrees  c, the sensitivity of detection was 8 mu for pepsin at ph 2.0, 1 mu for papain at ph 6.0, 0.6 mu for proteinase k at ph 7.4, and 2 mu for streptomyces griseus alkaline protease at ph 11. only 1-10 microliters of a growing culture was necessary to assay the protease activity of porphyromonas gingivalis or treponema denticola, oral bacteria that possess certain proteases on their surfaces. these  assays have clinical applications, since certain pathogens use proteolytic activity as a virulence mechanism and differ from their nonpathogenic counterparts in this characteristic. fluorescence polarization assays are simple, rapid, and reproducible.

TI  == the effects of a pulsed nd:yag laser on subgingival bacterial flora and on cementum: an in vivo study.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of scaling and nd:yag laser  treatments with that of scaling alone on cementum and levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola. study samples consisted of 14 patients, age 30 to 75 years,  8 females and 6 males, with a total of 150 periodontally involved sites with probing depth > or = 5 mm. group a consisted of 100 pockets that were subdivided  into 4 equal groups that were treated with conventional scaling and pulsed nd:yag laser using an optic fiber of 300 microns and 4 different power levels as follows: group 1: p = 0.8 w, f = 10 hz, e = 100 mj/pulse; group 2: p = 1.0 w, f = 1.0 hz, e = 100 mj/pulse; group 3: p = 1.2 w, f = 12 hz, e = 100 mj/purse; and group 4: p = 1.5 w, f = 15 hz, e = 100 mj/pulse. the time of each treatment was 60 sec per pocket in all 4 groups. group b consisted of 50 pockets that were treated by conventional scaling alone and served as a control group. microbiological samples from group a were collected before scaling; after scaling = before laser, just after laser, 2 weeks later, 6 weeks later, and 10 weeks later. microbiological samples from group b were collected before scaling, after  scaling, 6 weeks later, and 10 weeks later. microbiological analysis of all samples was done by the institute fur angewandte immunologie (iai) method. the effects of laser on root surfaces were assessed by sem examination and the sample consisted of 13 teeth from 5 different patients. four sets of 3 teeth each were treated with nd:yag laser using 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.5 w, respectively. one tooth was just scaled and not treated with laser to serve as a control. microbiological analysis of group a samples indicated posttreatment reduction in levels of all 4  bacterial types tested compared to pretreatment levels and group b controls. sem  examination of the specimens treated with nd:yag laser at different levels exhibited different features of root surface alterations.

TI  == associations between porphyromonas gingivalis and oral treponemes in subgingival  plaque.
AB  == colonization and/or proliferation of treponema denticola may depend on the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis. the aims of this study were to confirm this synergistic relationship, to determine whether other oral bacteria were similarly associated with p. gingivalis and to relate coinfection to the periodontal status of plaque donors. subgingival plaque was collected from every tooth except third  molars in 106 subjects who were grouped by their worst periodontal condition. in  addition to p. gingivalis, monoclonal antibodies were used to identify campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, t. denticola, treponema socranskii and pathogen-related oral spirochetes. associations of these bacteria with coinfection by p. gingivalis were assessed by estimated odds ratios. the results  indicate that coinfection with p. gingivalis is linked to all tested bacteria, but each pair was associated with distinct periodontal conditions. the distribution of coinfected sites suggests biased colonization of facial surfaces  over lingual surfaces.

TI  == a comparison of cysteine and serine proteinases in human gingival crevicular fluid with tissue, saliva and bacterial enzymes by analytical isoelectric focusing.
AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) contains several different proteinase activities  and the study sought to clarify their sources. gingival tissue and gcf were collected from chronic periodontitis patients. gel-filtration chromatography of crude tissue extracts yielded cathepsin b and tryptase fractions sensitive to cysteine and serine proteinase inhibitors, respectively. cell sonicates of suspected periodontal pathogens were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. of these, porphyromonas gingivalis showed much the strongest activity and this had an effector response consistent with the metal-dependent cysteine proteinase described by others. banding patterns in gcf, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. on z-val-lys-lys-arg-afc overlays, gcf had bands corresponding to tissue cathepsin b and the enzyme from p. gingivalis, though a contribution from treponema denticola could not be ruled out. use of d-val-leu-arg-afc overlays showed gcf activity similar to tissue tryptase. in gcf there were additional bands that did not correspond to any tissue or bacterial samples and on z-ala-ala-lys-afc overlays these closely resembled activity in parotid saliva. the results confirmed that gcf contains tissue cathepsin b and tryptase, while the apparent presence of enzymes from p. gingivalis and possibly  t. denticola is consistent with previous reports linking activity to these organisms. the saliva bands demonstrated that contamination of gcf may occur despite rigorous collection procedures.

TI  == antagonistic effect of oral bacteria towards treponema denticola.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola.  when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease  sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.

TI  == proteolytic artifacts in sds-page analysis of selected periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the aim of the study was to examine whether proteolytic artifacts, which result in a loss and poor resolution of protein bands, occur during sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular proteins from selected proteolytic (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola) and non-proteolytic (fusobacterium nucleatum) bacteria. conditions to limit or prevent proteolysis were also investigated. bacterial cells were incubated in solubilizing buffer (sds+ beta mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for various periods of time before boiling. a control assay consisted of trichloroacetic acid-treated bacterial cells. cellular proteins were separated by electrophoresis and stained with coomassie blue. proteolysis occurred very rapidly in the case of p. gingivalis (< 30 s), whereas a longer incubation time (> 1 h) was required to observe similar effects in p. nigrescens and t. denticola. no proteolysis was observed for f. nucleatum. in all cases, heat (100  degrees c) and low ph (< 4) treatments of bacterial cells could avoid production  of proteolytic artifacts. incorporation of specific protease inhibitors before solubilization of bacteria could also prevent proteolysis. more particularly, n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck), iodoacetamide and diisopropylfluorophosphate (50 mm) were highly efficient for p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens and t. denticola, respectively. when outer membranes of p. gingivalis  were prepared in the presence of tlck, numerous additional protein brands, not seen in the absence of tlck, were detected. the present study suggests that specific protease inhibitors, effective in preventing proteolysis, should be identified and added during cell fractionation and protein purification procedures.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. in the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt a gene of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp a gene of treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. these gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the pcr assays. primers for p. gingivalis detected p. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of capnocytophaga, 3 species of prevotella, 2 species of porphyromonas other than p. gingivalis, bacteroides levii, escherichia coli, 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of t. denticola. pcr analysis using primers for the lkt a gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. primers selected from the tdp a gene of t. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except t. denticola serovars a, b, and c. thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either p. gingivalis (33277), a. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717  and 43718) or t. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). the pcr assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.

TI  == periodontal status and detection frequency of bacteria at sites of periodontal health and gingivitis.
AB  == it is generally recognized that bacteria in dental plaque at sites of periodontal diseases are not commonly found at sites of periodontal health. one hypothesis to explain the etiology of periodontitis is that pathogenic bacteria from diseased sites infect healthy sites. it has been suggested that gingival inflammation may  predispose sites to colonization by bacteria associated with periodontal diseases. the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether the  detection frequency of selected bacteria at sites of periodontal health or gingivitis differed between subjects who were in good periodontal health, subjects who had gingivitis, or subjects with periodontitis. the clinical status  of every tooth (except third molars) from 106 subjects was characterized by means of clinical attachment level, probing depth and by signs of inflammation. subgingival plaque was collected from mesio-facial and disto-lingual surfaces. specific monoclonal antibodies were used in an immunocytochemical assay to identify campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pathogen-related oral spirochetes (pros, using treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum monoclonal antibodies), t. denticola (serotypes a-d), t. socranskii subspecies buccale and t. socranskii subspecies socranskii. differences in detection of bacteria between groups of subjects were measured using odds ratios  (or). results of this study indicate that pros was the only identified bacterium  at sites of both health and gingivitis that demonstrated a significant positive relationship with the presence of periodontitis. these findings do not prove that bacteria spread from periodontitis sites, nor do they imply that disease necessarily results from infection. however, these data do suggest that some bacteria associated with periodontitis are more likely than others to tolerate conditions at healthy sites and that the presence of periodontitis increases risk of infection at healthy sites.

TI  == interbacterial binding among strains of pathogenic and commensal oral bacterial species.
AB  == strong interspecies adherence was demonstrated among the periodontal pathogens treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus and porphyromonas gingivalis, and between these pathogens and the commensal plaque organism streptococcus crista. adherence showed specificity and demonstrated saturation binding kinetics. binding between b. forsythus and p. gingivalis appeared to be a unimodal protein-protein interaction. binding between the other organisms was at least bimodal involving interactions between combinations of proteins and carbohydrates with a variety of sugar specificities. salivary molecules prevented adherence between t. denticola and s. crista, and serum eliminated b. forsythus binding to  p. gingivalis. all other interactions occurred to some degree in the presence of  serum and saliva. such interbacterial binding interactions may be important in the establishment of periodontopathic plaque.

TI  == comparative virulence of periodontopathogens in a mouse abscess model.
AB  == objective(s): this report compares the virulence of selected strains of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, f. nucleatum and t. denticola in a murine model as a measure of pathogenic potential of these oral microorganisms. the characteristics of the tissue destruction associated with these monoinfections were then related to a potential model for bacterial synergism in  progressing periodontitis. design and methods: all bacterial strains were grown to mid-logarithmic to early stationary growth phase, harvested and used at various doses to challenge balb/c normal and balb/c dexamethasone (dex) treated mice to mimic a neutrophil dysfunction. the characteristics of tissue destruction, and overt tissue destructive capacity of these species were examined as a function of challenge dose and time. outcome measures: the mice were examined for an interval of approximately 15 days post-challenge and the presence/absence of lesions, localized or generalized nature of the lesion (including size in mm2), and lethality of the infection were assessed. results: comparison of the virulence of the various p. gingivalis strains related to lethality and lesion size associated with destruction of the connective tissue, indicated a virulence capacity of p. gingivalis strains 53977>w50 = t22>3079>33277>381. c. rectus elicited localized necrotic lesions which were limited to the epithelial layers of the skin. the size of the lesions also indicated a graded difference in virulence, such that c. rectus strains 234>576>>33238. a. actinomycetemcomitans caused the formation of classic localized abscesses with a pmn infiltrate and inflammatory exudates. although each of the a. actinomycetemcomitans strains exhibited a similar virulence pattern in this murine model, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b representative  strains were potentially more pathogenic with a virulence capacity of 3113d-n = 3975a>jp2 > or = y4>29523>33384. both c. rectus and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains showed clear evidence that recent clinical isolates were more virulent than laboratory strains. challenge with f. nucleatum resulted in tissue destructive responses which were different from those observed with the other strains used in this study. a rapid onset of dose-dependent lesion development, related to the formation of either closed abscesses or open lesions, was observed with f. nucleatum. tissue involvement was also greater at lower f. nucleatum doses when compared to the other bacteria. f. nucleatum challenge of dex-treated  mice resulted in a shift to open lesions. t. denticola appeared to be more tissue invasive than the other species examined in this study. challenge of mice with t. denticola resulted in involvement of multiple tissues, including epithelial and connective tissues, as well as appearing to invade muscle layers and deeper tissues. in addition to invading deeper tissues, the resulting lesions took considerably longer to resolve. in the dex-treated mice (neutrophil depleted), p. gingivalis, c. rectus, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly more virulent. in contrast, while dex treatment altered the characteristics of lesions caused by f. nucleatum, the extent of lesions produced by f. nucleatum and t. denticola was not substantially enhanced. conclusions: the results obtained from  this study suggest that different microorganisms have the ability to provide individual pathologies which may act in an additive/synergistic fashion contributing to the tissue destruction noted in periodontitis.

TI  == cellular source, activation and inhibition of dental plaque collagenase.
AB  == dental plaque is the major aetiological factor in periodontal diseases and contains several proteolytic enzymes. the origin of these proteinases is, however, poorly studied. this study was undertaken to characterize collagenase present in dental plaque of adult periodontitis patients. vertebrate-type rather  than bacterial-derived collagenase activity was detected in extracts of both supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts of adult periodontitis patients. dental plaque collagenase was found to exist predominantly in autoactive form. dental plaque collagenase from periodontally healthy individuals existed in latent from. latent dental plaque collagenase from periodontitis lesions could be activated by a 95 kd chymotrypsin-like proteinase from treponema denticola and human leukocyte cathepsin g but not by human plasmin. incubation of purified latent leukocyte collagenase with whole cells of fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium saburreum, prevotella buccae and porphyromonas gingivalis, however, did not result to the activation of the enzyme. doxycycline in vitro inhibited dental plaque collagenase with an ic50-value of 20 microm. dental plaque collagenase degraded more efficiently type i and ii collagens than type iii collagen. western-blot analysis with specific anti-human neutrophil collagenase-antibody revealed that both in supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts dental plaque collagenase had undergone proteolytic conversion from an 80 kd proform to a 58 kd active form which is associated with catalytic autoactivity as measured by functional collagenase assay. this reflects proteolytic activation of leukocyte collagenase in dental plaque probably by other proteases derived from potent periodontopathogenic bacteria such as t. denticola or other pmn proteases such as cathepsin g.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparison of host tissue and bacterial dipeptidyl peptidases in human gingival crevicular fluid by analytical isoelectric focusing.
AB  == earlier work has shown that gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) contains dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp) activities that resemble those in host tissue. here, further comparisons were made with enzymes from suspected periodontal pathogens. gingival tissue and gcf were collected from patients with chronic periodontitis. dpp ii and dpp iv fractions with acid and alkaline ph optima, respectively, were separated from crude tissue extracts by gel-filtration chromatography. bacterial  cell sonicates were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. there was  moderate to strong dpp activity with capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp., very weak activity with treponema denticola and no detectable activity with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fusobacterium nucleatum. banding patterns in gcf, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. in  gels washed with acid buffer, gcf had bands corresponding to tissue dpp ii. use of an alkaline washing buffer showed gcf activity which closely matched tissue dpp iv that had been pretreated with neuraminidase, an enzyme found by others in  the gingival crevice. p. gingivalis gave multiple bands and several of these had  counterparts in gcf. the apparent presence in gcf of the dpp from p. gingivalis is consistent with the association of this organism with destructive periodontitis.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of  treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the  outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.

AB  == the aim of this study was to obtain measurements of oral malodor, as measured by  volatile sulfur compounds (vsc), in periodontally healthy individuals without any complaints of bad breath, and to compare the results with data obtained from patients with complaints of oral malodor. the quality of the mouth air was assessed organoleptically and a portable sulfide monitor was used to measure the  concentration of vsc in mouth air. the gingival health of 35 individuals (21 m, 14 f; ages 18-57 years) without any malodor complaints was evaluated according to the papillary bleeding score (pbs). pocket depths and bleeding upon probing (bop) were also recorded in 20 patients (11 females and 9 males ranging in age from 14  to 71 years) who complained of oral malodor. scrapings of the dorsal surface of the tongue and each of 6 plaque samples per patient were evaluated for the presence of bana-positive species, such as t. denticola, p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus. the organoleptic ratings and vsc values were significantly higher in the complaint group (p < 0.05). subjects in the complaint group had a significantly higher percentage of bleeding sites (p < 0.005) and had significantly more plaques that tested positive for the presence of bana-hydrolyzing species (p < 0.05). tongue scrapings of subjects with a high organoleptic score consistently yielded a positive bana reaction suggesting that  the dorsal surface of the tongue is an important niche for bana-positive, vsc-producing bacteria. this study suggests that the primary sources of vsc production are bana-hydrolyzing bacteria in the plaque and on the dorsal surface  of the tongue.

TI  == configural frequency analysis for exploring bacterial sets in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == periodontal research has been concerned with identifying bacterial sets in oral health and disease. configural frequency analysis (cfa) is a taxonomical method used to test the statistical significance of patterns of elementary cell frequencies in cross-tabulated data, and may therefore be used to evaluate interactions among occurrences and non-occurrences of periodontal microorganisms. cfa patterns may exist as configural types or anti-types depending on whether observed cell frequencies are greater or less than expected frequencies, respectively, based on table marginals. cfa was applied to two published data sets. in the first, the occurrence of bacteroides (porphyromonas) gingivalis (bg) and treponema denticola (td) was studied in military subjects. analysis of individual cells of the resultant two-by-two contingency table revealed the existence of a single anti-type (td in the absence of bg) suggesting a sequential phenomenon. the second, more complex, data set was based on reported occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), bg, and bacteroides (prevotella) intermedius (bi) in sites with and without progressive periodontitis. cfa based on all data identified three statistically significant configural types and two anti-types. however, a somewhat different configurational picture emerged when disease progression status was considered a stratification variable for separate  analysis. all these analyses, which were undertaken for expository purposes, assumed independence of observations. methodological procedures are suggested for cfa when observations are not independent.

TI  == measurement of electrical bioimpedance for studying utilization of amino acids and peptides by porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema  denticola.
AB  == the growth response of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola to peptides (supplied as trypticase) and amino acids (supplied as casamino acids) was measured over 24 hours by monitoring changes in  alternating-current conductivity at 37 degrees c. all species utilized peptides preferentially over amino acids. these results are consistent with those obtained previously with conventional growth-response experiments. the duration of the linear growth response to trypticase of p. gingivalis was 9.7 hours, whereas that of both f. nucleatum and t. denticola was > 24 hours. by contrast, there was more uniformity in the utilization of amino acids from the casamino acid mixture, which previously has been shown to be a poor growth substrate. furthermore, subtle differences in growth patterns, such as the ability of f. nucleatum to metabolize its storage glycopolymers before utilizing amino acids, were clearly evident. the present method provides an excellent means of studying bacterial growth kinetics and delineating bacterial/substrate specificities of both synthetic and natural substrates.

AB  == intracrevicular plaque from periodontally-healthy individuals who had refrained from oral hygiene measures for 24 h prior to sampling, and subgingival plaque from diseased sites of patients with chronic periodontitis were screened by elisa for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the samples were also subjected to the perioscan test to detect the presence of enzymes capable of degrading n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-2-naphthylamide (bana). of the 141 samples from periodontally-healthy sites, 73% contained t. denticola antigens and 78% p. gingivalis antigens, compared to 43% and 59%, respectively, in plaque samples from the 159 diseased sites. a positive reaction in the perioscan test was obtained in 89% of plaque samples from diseased sites and in 60% of those from healthy sites. the correlation between the results of the two assays was poor in the case of intracrevicular plaque from healthy sites. however, with plaque samples from diseased sites, the results of the perioscan test showed very strong correlation with those obtained with the elisa, suggesting that the former may be a useful, rapid means of indicating the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis in such plaque samples.

TI  == the effect of incubation temperature on the specificity of the bana (n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide) test.
AB  == the hydrolysis of bana by subgingival plaque samples is associated with the presence of either treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and/or bacteroides forsythus. a protocol in which pure cultures were incubated for 15 min at 55 degrees c detected about 5 x 10(5) cfu of p. gingivalis and 1 x 10(6) cfu of t. denticola. clinical studies indicated that the bana test in this configuration will detect about 10(4) organisms in vivo as compared with the 10(5) to 10(6) organisms found with in vitro grown cells. the bana test can be made less sensitive by decreasing the time and/or temperature of incubation, which could improve the specificity of the test. in the present study we determined the incubation parameters that would give optimal specificity when the plaque samples were removed from sites of gingival health. twenty-six approximal  plaque samples were taken from each of 90 clinically healthy subjects and incubated with the bana substrate on perioscan cards (oral-b laboratories) for 5  and 15 min at 35 degrees, 45 degrees, and 55 degrees c. subjects were randomly assigned to the various temperatures. wooden toothpicks were inserted interproximally in all sites anterior to distal of the first molars and then each side of the toothpick was wiped onto the perioscan card. the specificity of the bana test relative to clinical health was 96% when the cards were incubated for 5 min at 35 degrees c, but decreased to 50-70% when the cards were incubated for 15 min at 35 degrees c or for 5 and 15 min at 45 degrees c and 55 degrees c.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == phosphorylated nutrient uptake by treponema denticola and other potential periodontopathogens.
AB  == nutrient uptake may contribute to the survival of certain potential periodontopathogens in the competitive environment of the gingival sulcus. this study was conducted to assess the uptake of commercially available, key radiolabelled phosphorylated compounds by treponema denticola. there was a linear relationship in the uptake of atp and g-1-p with cell concentrations of 0.1-2.5 mg of cell dry weight. this uptake reached a steady state within 15 min, and at temperatures of 25-37 degrees c the uptake ranged between 13-21%. at 50 degrees c, or above 50 degrees c the assay cells took up 0-1% of the assay nutrients. the maximum uptake of atp was 47.5, 38 and 47.6 pmoles for serovars a, b and c. g-1-p yielded maximum uptake values of 306, 304, and 306 pmoles respectively. significant uptake of atp, or g-1-p occurred at ph 4.8 for serovars a, or c, while serovar b showed a broad ph range for the uptake of g-1-p. stannous fluoride at a concentration of 0.17 mm enhanced the uptake of atp while chlorhexidine digluconate inhibited the uptake of atp. at concentrations usually  employed (0.05-0.5 mm) the metabolic poisons 2,4-dinitrophenol, sodium azide, sodium arsenite and the atpase inhibitor n,n1-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide did not alter significantly the uptake of atp. the uptake of atp, by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and t. denticola at ph 4.8 was 13.4, 1.5, 6.9, and 18-20.4%, respectively. at ph 6.5 the uptake for the microorganisms indicated above was 22, 1.3, 6.6 and 6.2%, respectively. g-1-p showed the same trend in its uptake by a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. denticola. this study provides for the first time specific examples of phosphorylated nutrient uptake by potential periodontopathogens, and that the uptake of phosphorylated nutrients can be suppressed by oral hygienic compounds.

TI  == demonstration of a bimodal coaggregation reaction between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == this study demonstrates a strong coaggregation reaction between 2 suspected periodontopathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. other black-pigmented oral bacterial species tested did not coaggregate with t. denticola. this specific interbacterial aggregation was bimodal, since heating of both cell types was required to completely eliminate the reaction. the coaggregation reaction occurred between ph 4 and 9. under some conditions, arginine and d-galactosamine were effective in preventing the coaggregation. the  heat-sensitive receptor on p. gingivalis was found to be loosely bound and could  be released by a light ultrasonic treatment of the cells. it is suggested that the bacterial interaction described may participate in the establishment of a potentially pathogenic subgingival plaque.

TI  == inhibition of peptidase and glycosidase activities of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius and treponema denticola by plant extracts.
AB  == aqueous extracts from 5 plants used widely in kenya as chewing sticks (mswaki) for the control of oral hygiene were tested for their ability to inhibit extracellular peptidase and glycosidase enzyme activities produced by the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly bacteroides gingivalis), bacteroides intermedius and treponema denticola. the plants studied  were rhus natalensis, cupressus hisitanica, sida cordifolia, olea africana and euclea divinorum. protease activities, including glycylprolyl dipeptidase and trypsin-like activities of p. gingivalis, chymotrypsin-like and glycylprolyl dipeptidase activities of b. intermedius and the trypsin-like activity of t. denticola, were particularly affected by extracts from rhus natalensis and euclea divinorum. glycosidase activities were generally less affected with the notable exceptions of the inhibition of beta-mannosidase activity of p. gingivalis by all extracts and the inhibition of neuraminidase activity of t. denticola by rhus natalensis and euclea divinorum. generally, these same proteolytic and glycosidic activities were inhibited by tannic acid and to lesser extents by gallic acid and gallic acid methyl ester. an inhibitory component, present in all extracts, exhibited physical and chemical properties identical to those of tannic acid. the inhibition of these enzyme activities is likely to reduce the virulence of these  periodontophathic bacteria and to reduce the rate of dental plaque formation.

TI  == bacterial synergy of treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis in a multinational population.
AB  == treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with human  adult severe periodontitis. in this study, we quantified these putative pathogens in subgingival plaque samples collected from 74 fijians, 74 colombians and 73 u.s. americans stationed at the multinational force and observers encampment in the sinai desert, egypt. a contingency table of t. denticola and p. gingivalis frequency revealed a highly significant synergistic relationship. we discovered that the occurrence of t. denticola apparently requires the presence of p. gingivalis. this represents the first observation of a synergistic relationship between these putative oral pathogens associated with adult severe periodontal disease.

TI  == treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis as prognostic markers following  periodontal treatment.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were collected from individuals with advanced periodontitis before and 3 to 11 weeks after scaling and root planing periodontal treatment. the plaque levels of treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis  antigens were measured before and after treatment by a quantitative immunoassay procedure using monoclonal antibodies specific for these oral bacteria. a decrease in mean levels of t. denticola (p less than .05) and p. gingivalis antigens (p less than .09) were observed following periodontal therapy. improved  health, as measured by a decrease in probing depth, was associated with a decrease in t. denticola antigen (p less than .05). these results suggest that the t. denticola levels of successfully treated sites decreased, while non-responding sites had levels of this microbial marker which were equal to or greater than the pre-treatment levels. these results provide additional evidence  that t. denticola is associated with human adult severe periodontal disease, and  can serve as a prognostic marker for disease recurrence.

TI  == application of bana during experimental gingivitis. application of n-alpha-benzoyl-dl-arginine 2 naphtilamide (bana) hydrolysis to identify periodontopathic environments during experimental gingivitis in man.
AB  == this study evaluates the accuracy of the perioscan reagent card kit which uses bana hydrolization to detect the presence of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and b.  forsythus in dental plaque during an experimental gingivitis in man. 32 healthy subjects underwent a phase of optimal oral hygiene before they abolished all oral hygiene practices for 21 days, but rinsed twice daily with a slurry of three different toothpastes. on days 0, 7, 14, and 21, full mouth plaque and gingival index scores were assessed and, in addition, on days 0 and 21, sulcular plaque samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal aspects of the second premolars. the samples were placed on bana reagent cards (perioscan), and the result of the trypsin-like activity read after 15 minutes. subsequently, the samples were processed for the detection of p. gingivalis, t. denticola and b. forsythus using elisa. the gingival indices on day 21 indicated a development towards gingival inflammation. the frequencies of detection of the three periodontopathogens revealed by elisa showed increased presence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola on day 21. changes in the composition of the microbiota were also indicated by the higher rate of positive bana results at the end of the experimental gingivitis. without considering further clinical diagnostic tests such as "bleeding on probing", this clinically simple test does not provide a prognostic indicator for the eventual onset of disease in cases with gingival inflammation. however, specificity was only 61% and the sensitivity was 41.7%.

TI  == benzoyl-arginine naphthylamide (bana) hydrolysis by treponema denticola and/or bacteroides gingivalis in periodontal plaques.
AB  == treponema denticola and bacteroides gingivalis are among the few recognized species found in periodontal pockets that can hydrolyze the synthetic peptide n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-2-naphthylamide (bana). we determined the presence of these periodontal pathogens in bana-positive and -negative plaque samples through the use of indirect immunofluorescent antibody techniques. eighteen of 27 diseased sites gave bana-positive reactions, and 9 gave bana-negative reactions. t. denticola was present in 16 of 18 bana-positive reactions, whereas b. gingivalis  was detected in 9 of the 18 bana-positive reactions. t. denticola was present in  1 and b. gingivalis in 2 of the 9 bana-negative reactions. neither organism was detected in the 19 healthy sites that were negative for bana. all measured differences between bana-positive and bana-negative plaques obtained in the same  individuals were statistically significant. the accuracy of the bana test, compared with clinical parameters such as bleeding upon probing and increased probing depth, was about 80%. the accuracy of the test in detecting the presence  of t. denticola was 93%, for b. gingivalis, 76% and for t. denticola and/or b. gingivalis, 96%. this study indicated that bana-positive plaques were associated  with the presence of t. denticola and/or b. gingivalis, that t. denticola was found at a greater frequency and levels in bana-positive plaques than b. gingivalis, and that the presence of these organisms was associated with clinical disease.

TI  == the formation of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan by oral bacteria.
AB  == the capacity to form volatile sulfur compounds was tested in bacteria isolated from subgingival microbiotas and in a representative number of reference strains. a majority of the 75 tested oral bacterial species and 7 unnamed bacterial taxa formed significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine. the most active bacteria were found in the genera peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, selenomonas, centipeda, bacteroides and fusobacterium. methyl mercaptan from l-methionine was  formed by some members of the genera fusobacterium, bacteroides, porphyromonas and eubacterium. when incubated in serum for 7 d, the most potent producers of hydrogen sulfide were treponema denticola and the black-pigmented species, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loescheii, porphyromonas endodontalis and porphyromonas gingivalis. p. endodontalis and p. gingivalis also produced significant amounts of methyl mercaptan in serum. no other volatile sulfur compound was detected in serum or in the presence of l-cysteine and l-methionine. these findings significantly increase the list of oral bacteria known to produce  volatile sulfur compounds.

TI  == growth stimulation of treponema denticola by periodontal microorganisms.
AB  == previous experiments have indicated that enrichment of subgingival plaque in human serum can lead to the accumulation of treponema denticola. t. denticola depends on bacterial interactions for its growth in serum. aim of the present study was to identify specific microorganisms involved in the growth stimulation  of t. denticola. to this end, strains isolated from previous plaque enrichment cultures were tested for growth stimulation in co-cultures with t. denticola. in  addition, growth of t. denticola was tested in culture filtrates of the same strains, bacteroides intermedius, eubacterium nodatum, veillonella parvula and fusobacterium nucleatum were found to enhance growth of t. denticola in co-cultures. a continuous co-culture of t. denticola, f. nucleatum and b. intermedius in human serum gave very high levels of t. denticola, up to 3.10(9).ml-1. mechanisms involved in growth stimulation may include the ability of b. intermedius and e. nodatum to cleave the protein-core of serum (glyco-)proteins, making these molecules accessible for degradation by t. denticola. in addition, e. nodatum was found to produce a low-molecular weight growth-factor for t. denticola, that was heat-stable and acid as well as alkaline resistant. v. parvula may provide peptidase activities complementary to those of  t. denticola. the nature of the growth enhancing activity of f. nucleatum is yet  unknown. the data support the dependency of t. denticola on other bacterial species for growth in the periodontal pocket.

TI  == inhibition of protease activities of periodontopathic bacteria by extracts of plants used in kenya as chewing sticks (mswaki).
AB  == extracts from five plants used as chewing sticks, and tannic acid, gallic acid and methyl ester of gallic acid, were tested for their ability to inhibit proteolytic activities of three strains of bacteroides gingivalis, three strains  of bacteroides intermedius and two strains of treponema denticola. aqueous extract from the plants rhus natalensis and euclea divinorum were the most inhibitory of those tested, inhibiting by 50% the proteolytic activity of the test organisms, at concentrations of up to 200 micrograms/ml. tannic and gallic acids had similar effects at concentrations of less than 10 micrograms/ml, while  the methyl ester of gallic acid was less inhibitory. these findings suggest that  extracts from plants used as chewing sticks may possess enough inhibitory components to interfere with the virulence and growth of periodontopathic bacteria in vivo, provided they are able to gain access to the subgingival sites  such bacteria preferentially inhabit.

TI  == [correlation between subgingival microflora and peptidase activity in periodontal pockets measured with synthetic substrates].
AB  == the activity of peptidases in periodontal pockets of patients were examined by using four different synthetic enzyme substrates, and surveyed their correlation  with the microbial populations of subgingival plaque and clinical symptoms. the substrates were (1) alpha-n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (bana), (2) n-carbobenzoxy-glycylglycyl-arginine-4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide, (3) alpha-n-benzoyl-l-arginylglycyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-proline-4-methoxy -beta-naphthylamide and (4) n-carbobenzoxy-prolyl-l-alanylglycyl-l-proline-4-methoxy-beta naphthylamide. whereas substrates (1) and (2) were hydrolyzed more specifically by peptidases of mainly bacteroides gingivalis and treponema denticola, substrates (3) and (4) were susceptible to most of the strains of black-pigmented bacteroides, capnocytophaga and t. denticola. correlation between the peptidase activity and the level of spirochetes in the plaques were observed with the substrates (1), (2) and (3). substrate (3) had the strongest correlation also with the level of the black-pigmented bacteroides and with the depth of the periodontal pockets, suggesting that it is a better substrate for enzymatic diagnosis than bana which  is currently used as an indicator of oral spirochetes and the black-pigmented bacteroides.

TI  == api zym system for identification of bacteroides spp., capnocytophaga spp., and spirochetes of oral origin.
AB  == a total of 80 oral strains of bacteroides gingivalis, b. asaccharolyticus, b. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, b. melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus, capnocytophaga, treponema denticola, and t. vincentii were characterized with the api zym system for 19 enzyme activities. comparison of anaerobic and aerobic incubation with nine reference strains of these organisms showed no important differences. the key differential tests for black-pigmented bacteroides strains and treponemes of oral origin were trypsin, alpha-glucosidase, and n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. all capnocytophaga strains produced distinctive aminopeptidase activities but varied in their glycosidic capabilities. the presence of a trypsin-like activity in b. gingivalis, t. denticola, and a group of capnocytophaga strains may contribute to tissue destruction in periodontal disease.

TI  == lymphoproliferative responses to oral bacteria in humans with varying severities  of periodontal disease.
AB  == we assessed in vitro the lymphocyte blastogenic resp onsess of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigen extracts of a large battery of oral microorganisms in a population of humans with varying severities of periodontal disease. when the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. the actinomyces species proved to be potent stimulators of lymphocyte blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas streptococcus sanguis, campylobacter, and eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. the response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. however, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including bacteroides asaccharolyticus and treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis. these results, taken together with recent microbiological findings, suggest that the specificity of the lymphocyte blastogenic response to antigens of oral bacteria correlates with the presence of these organisms in the subgingival microflora during various periodontal disease  states.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
