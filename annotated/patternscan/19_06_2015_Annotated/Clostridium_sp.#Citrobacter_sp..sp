TI  == 1,3-propanediol production with citrobacter werkmanii dsm17579: effect of a dhad  knock-out.
AB  == background: 1,3-propanediol (pdo) is a substantially industrial metabolite used in the polymer industry. although several natural pdo production hosts exist, e.g. klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and clostridium sp., the pdo yield on glycerol is insufficient for an economically viable bio-process. enhancing this yield via strain improvement can be achieved by disconnecting the production and  growth pathways. in the case of pdo formation, this approach results in a microorganism metabolizing glycerol strictly for pdo production, while catabolizing a co-substrate for growth and maintenance. we applied this strategy  to improve the pdo production with citrobacter werkmanii dsm17579. results: genetic tools were developed and used to create citrobacter werkmanii dsm17579 dhad in which dhad, encoding for glycerol dehydrogenase, was deleted. since this  strain was unable to grow on glycerol anaerobically, both pathways were disconnected. the knock-out strain was perturbed with 13 different co-substrates  for growth and maintenance. glucose was the most promising, although a competition between nadh-consuming enzymes and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase emerged. conclusion: due to the deletion of dhad in citrobacter werkmanii dsm17579, the pdo production and growth pathway were split. as a consequence, the pdo yield on glycerol was improved 1,5 times, strengthening the idea that citrobacter werkmanii dsm17579 could become an industrially interesting host for  pdo production.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == unraveling the dha cluster in citrobacter werkmanii: comparative genomic analysis of bacterial 1,3-propanediol biosynthesis clusters.
AB  == in natural 1,3-propanediol (pdo) producing microorganisms such as klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and clostridium sp., the genes coding for pdo producing enzymes are grouped in a dha cluster. this article describes the dha cluster of a novel candidate for pdo production, citrobacter werkmanii dsm17579 and compares the cluster to the currently known pdo clusters of enterobacteriaceae and clostridiaceae. moreover, we attribute a putative function to two previously unannotated orfs, orfw and orfy, both in c. freundii and in c.  werkmanii: both proteins might form a complex and support the glycerol dehydratase by converting cob(i)alamin to the glycerol dehydratase cofactor coenzyme b12. unraveling this biosynthesis cluster revealed high homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frames of c. werkmanii dsm17579 and those of c. freundii dsm30040 and k. pneumoniae mgh78578, i.e., 96 and 87.5 % identity, respectively. on the other hand, major differences between the clusters have also been discovered. for example, only one dihydroxyacetone kinase (dhak) is present in the dha cluster of c. werkmanii dsm17579, while two dhak enzymes are present in the cluster of k. pneumoniae mgh78578 and clostridium butyricum vpi1718.

TI  == the effect of heavy metals on microbial community structure of a sulfidogenic consortium in anaerobic semi-continuous stirred tank reactors.
AB  == the effect of heavy metals on community structure of a heavy metal tolerant sulfidogenic consortium was evaluated by using a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene and dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrb) gene fragments, 16s rrna gene cloning analysis and fluorescence  in situ hybridization (fish). for this purpose, four anaerobic semi-continuous stirred tank reactors (referred as r1-r4) were run in parallel for 12 weeks at heavy metal loading rates of 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 7.5 mg l(-1) d(-1) each of cu(2+), ni(2+), zn(2+), and cr(6+), respectively. the abundance ratio of desulfovibrio vulgaris detected by fish to total cell counts was consistent with the obtained results of cloning and dgge. this indicated that d. vulgaris was dominant in all  analyzed samples and played a key role in heavy metal removal in r1, r2, and r3.  in contrast, after 4 weeks of operation of r4, a distinct biomass loss was observed and no positive hybridized cells were detected by specific probes for the domain bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria and d. vulgris. high removal efficiencies of heavy metals were achieved in r1, r2 and r3 after 12 weeks, whereas the precipitation of heavy metals in r4 was significantly decreased after 4 weeks and almost not observed after 6 weeks of operation. in addition, the anaerobic bacteria, such as pertrimonas sulfuriphila, clostridium sp., citrobacter amalonaticus, and klebsiella sp., identified from dgge bands and clone library were hypothesized as heavy metal resistant bacteria at a loading rate of 1.5 mg l(-1) d(-1) of cu(2+), ni(2+), zn(2+), and cr(6+.)

TI  == comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  == in this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (vb) and through cesarean section (cb) were investigated using culture-independent 16s rdna cloning and sequencing approach. the results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of vb infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart cb infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants  delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. the most abundant bacterial species present in vb infants were acinetobacter sp., bifidobacterium sp. and staphylococcus sp. however, cb infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with citrobacter sp., escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. the intestinal  microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of bifidobacteria species. an interesting finding of  our study was recovery of large number of acinetobacter sp. consisting of acinetobacter pittii (former acinetobacter genomic species 3), acinetobacter junii and acinetobacter baumannii in the vb infants clone library. among these, acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of tce-dechlorinating consortia enriched on a variety of electron donors.
AB  == two rapidly fermented electron donors, lactate and methanol, and two slowly fermented electron donors, propionate and butyrate, were selected for enrichment  studies to evaluate the characteristics of anaerobic microbial consortia that reductively dechlorinate tce to ethene. each electron donor enrichment subculture demonstrated the ability to dechlorinate tce to ethene through several serial transfers. microbial community analyses based upon 16s rdna, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and clone library/sequencing, were performed to assess major changes in microbial community structure associated with electron donors capable of stimulating reductive dechlorination.  results demonstrated that five phylogenic subgroups or genera of bacteria were present in all consortia, including dehalococcoides sp., low g+c gram-positives (mostly clostridium and eubacterium sp.), bacteroides sp., citrobacter sp., and delta proteobacteria (mostly desulfovibrio sp.). phylogenetic association indicates that only minor shifts in the microbial community structure occurred between the four alternate electron donor enrichments and the parent consortium.  inconsistent detection of dehalococcoides spp. in clone libraries and t-rflp of enrichment subcultures was resolved using quantitative polymerase chain reaction  (q-pcr). q-pcr with primers specific to dehalococcoides 16s rdna resulted in positive detection of this species in all enrichments. our results suggest that tce-dechlorinating consortia can be stably maintained on a variety of electron donors and that quantities of dehalococcoides cells detected with dehalococcoides specific 16s rdna primer/probe sets do not necessarily correlate well with solvent degradation rates.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  == a genomic library of clostridium perfringens atcc 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the c. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. a positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb dna fragment insert was selected  and purified. lytic and lysogenic escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. the 3.8 kb dna fragment was amplified by pcr and found to hybridize with one band from c. perfringens dna digested with ecor1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. the fragment also hybridized with dna from other azoreductase-producing clostridium species, a eubacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter amalonaticus and e. coli, but  not with dna from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. the data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of c. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in  others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == purification and properties of crystalline 3-methylaspartase from two facultative anaerobes, citrobacter sp. strain yg-0504 and morganella morganii strain yg-0601.
AB  == 3-methylaspartase (3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase, ec 4.3.1.2) from two facultative anaerobes from soil, citrobacter sp. strain yg-0504 and morganella morganii strain yg-0601, were purified and crystallized from their crude extracts. both of the citrobacter and morganella enzymes appeared to be a dimer of subunits of m(r) 40,000 and 44,000, respectively. the enzymes had similar enzymological properties: optimum ph for the deamination reaction of (2s,3s)-3-methylaspartic acid, substrate specificity, inhibitor, divalent and monovalent cation requirement, and n-terminal amino acid sequence homology. however, some differences were detected in ph and temperature stability, optimum  ph for the amination reaction of mesaconic acid, optimum temperature, specific activity, and stability during electrophoresis. both enzymes had similar enzymological properties to the known 3-methylaspartase from an obligate anaerobic bacterium, clostridium tetanomorphum h1, except kinetic constants and substrate specificities.

AB  == rokitamycin, a newly developed macrolide antibiotic was orally administered to 7  healthy male volunteers (22-25 years) for 7 consecutive days to study changes in  bacterial flora and concentrations of the drug in feces, and to observe adverse reactions and laboratory test parameters. a dose of 200 mg (2 tablets: 100 mg/tablet) was given 3 times daily before meals and the fecal studies were done on the 5 days before administration (adm.) [b.a.], at the time of administration  (0), and the 3rd, 5th, 7th (the final day of treatment) days during adm. [u.a.] and the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th days after adm. [a.a.]. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. obvious changes in mean populations of total aerobes and enterobacteriaceae were not found. in changes of each bacteria of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli was not observed in cases from initial day of treatment to the 3rd day a.a. cases from which citrobacter sp. was isolated tended to increase after 3 days u.a. and gradually decrease after 3 days a.a. among gram-negative bacilli, cases where isolation of pseudomonas sp. was observed increased temporarily on the 3rd u.a., gram-positive cocci did not show  particular patterns of changes. no changes in mean count of total anaerobes were  observed during the course of the experiment. among individual anaerobes, numbers of lactobacillus and peptococcaceae decreased slightly from the 3rd day u.a. and  returned on the 5th day a.a. 2. clostridium difficile d-1 toxin was detected in feces at amounts approximately 500 ng/g in 2 cases each on 20th and 30th day a.a., with 1 incidence occurring in the same person on the 2 separate days. 3. the drug was detected in all 7 cases on the 3rd, 5th and 7th days u.a., and in 1  cases each on the 5th and the 30th day a.a. the mean peak level was 315.5 micrograms/g on the 7th day u.a. the reason for the detection of the drug in feces in 1 case on the 30th day a.a. at a value of 5.90 micrograms/g was not clear. 4. adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory test results due to this drug were not observed in any cases.

TI  == in vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

(mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.
