TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == coaggregation between prevotella oris and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/purpose: the coaggregation of bacteria has been defined as one of the  most important processes in the oral infection such as periodontitis. prevotella  oris and porphyromonas gingivalis, which are two of the periodontopathogens, are  frequently detected in severe forms of periodontal diseases. however, the interaction between p. oris and p. gingivalis is still unknown. in this study, the coaggregation of p. oris with nine oral bacterial species including p. gingivalis was examined. methods: all bacteria used in this study were cultured anaerobically and suspended in coaggregation buffer. each cell suspension was mixed in a test tube and subjected to shaking at room temperature for 1 hour. subsequently, the coaggregation values were scored. furthermore, the effects of various chemical reagents, and heat, proteinase k, and serum treatment were examined. results: in this study, p. oris coaggregated only with p. gingivalis. a heat-stable, nonproteinous component of p. oris and a heat-labile, proteinous component of p. gingivalis play important roles in this coaggregation. in addition, this coaggregation was inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine. therefore, it was considered that a cell surface protein on p. gingivalis, such as gingipain, may be involved in the coaggregation. furthermore, the coaggregation was not inhibited by serum treatment. conclusion:  this is the first report to describe the coaggregation of p. oris and p. gingivalis. our study proposes the possibility that p. oris may promote the colonization of p. gingivalis in an early stage of biofilm formation. furthermore, this coaggregation may contribute to the initiation and progression  of periodontitis.

TI  == the release of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) from human erythrocyte membranes lysed by hemolysin of prevotella oris.
AB  == we found that a 38-kda protein was released from erythrocyte membranes lysed by hemolysin of prevotella oris, although hypotonic hemolysis did not show such a phenomenon. the 38-kda protein was identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) by n-terminal amino acid sequencing. this study discusses the relationship between gapdh and hemolysis.

TI  == molecular methods for diagnosis of odontogenic infections.
AB  == purpose: historically, the identification of microorganisms has been limited to species that could be cultured in the microbiology laboratory. the purpose of the present study was to apply molecular techniques to identify microorganisms in orofacial odontogenic infections (ois). materials and methods: specimens were obtained from subjects with clinical evidence of oi. to identify the microorganisms involved, 16s rrna sequencing methods were used on clinical specimens. the name and number of the clones of each species identified and the combinations of species present were recorded for each subject. descriptive statistics were computed for the study variables. results: specimens of pus or wound fluid were obtained from 9 subjects. a mean of 7.4 +/- 3.7 (standard deviation) species per case were identified. the predominant species detected in  the present study that have previously been associated with ois were fusobacterium spp, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella oris. the predominant species detected in our study that have not been previously associated with ois were dialister pneumosintes and eubacterium brachy. unculturable phylotypes accounted for 24% of the species identified in our study. all species detected were obligate or facultative anaerobes. streptococci were not detected. conclusions: molecular methods have enabled us to detect previously cultivated and not-yet-cultivated species in ois; these methods could change our  understanding of the pathogenic flora of orofacial ois.

TI  == correlation network analysis applied to complex biofilm communities.
AB  == the complexity of the human microbiome makes it difficult to reveal organizational principles of the community and even more challenging to generate  testable hypotheses. it has been suggested that in the gut microbiome species such as bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are keystone in maintaining the stability and functional adaptability of the microbial community. in this study, we investigate the interspecies associations in a complex microbial biofilm applying systems biology principles. using correlation network analysis we identified bacterial modules that represent important microbial associations within the oral community. we used dental plaque as a model community because of its high diversity and the well known species-species interactions that are common in the  oral biofilm. we analyzed samples from healthy individuals as well as from patients with periodontitis, a polymicrobial disease. using results obtained by checkerboard hybridization on cultivable bacteria we identified modules that correlated well with microbial complexes previously described. furthermore, we extended our analysis using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim), which includes a large number of bacterial species, among them uncultivated organisms present in the mouth. two distinct microbial communities appeared in healthy individuals while there was one major type in disease. bacterial modules in all communities did not overlap, indicating that bacteria were able to effectively re-associate with new partners depending on the environmental conditions. we then identified hubs that could act as keystone species in the bacterial modules. based on those results we then cultured a not-yet-cultivated microorganism, tannerella sp. ot286 (clone bu063). after two rounds of enrichment by a selected helper (prevotella oris ot311) we obtained colonies of tannerella sp. ot286 growing on blood agar plates. this system-level  approach would open the possibility of manipulating microbial communities in a targeted fashion as well as associating certain bacterial modules to clinical traits (e.g.: obesity, crohn's disease, periodontal disease, etc).

TI  == exploring bacterial diversity of endodontic microbiota by cloning and sequencing  16s rrna.
AB  == introduction: the characterization of microbial communities infecting the endodontic system in each clinical condition may help on the establishment of a correct prognosis and distinct strategies of treatment. the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in primary endodontic infections by 16s  ribosomal-rna (rrna) sequence analysis. methods: samples from root canals of untreated asymptomatic teeth (n = 12) exhibiting periapical lesions were obtained, 16s rrna bacterial genomic libraries were constructed and sequenced, and bacterial diversity was estimated. results: a total of 489 clones were analyzed (mean, 40.7 +/- 8.0 clones per sample). seventy phylotypes were identified of which six were novel phylotypes belonging to the family ruminococcaceae. the mean number of taxa per canal was 10.0, ranging from 3 to 21 per sample; 65.7% of the cloned sequences represented phylotypes for which no cultivated isolates have been reported. the most prevalent taxa were atopobium rimae (50.0%), dialister invisus, prevotella oris, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and tannerella forsythia (33.3%). conclusions: although several key species predominate in endodontic samples of asymptomatic cases with periapical lesions, the primary endodontic infection is characterized by a wide bacterial diversity, which is mostly represented by members of the phylum firmicutes belonging to the class clostridia followed by the phylum bacteroidetes.

TI  == stimulants of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 are elevated in saliva of periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == aim: because the absorption of stimulants of toll-like receptor (tlr)2 and tlr4 from the gastrointestinal tract into the circulation has been proposed to promote the development of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance, we aimed to quantify the abundance of stimulants of tlr2 and tlr4 in human saliva. methods: a recently developed bioassay based upon measurement of nf-kappab activation in tlr-deficient human embryonic kidney (hek)-293 cells transfected with human tlr2  or tlr4 and calibrated with synthetic bacterial lipopeptide (pam(3) csk(4) ) or escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps), was used to establish the normal range of tlr stimulants in saliva of 20 healthy subjects and 20 subjects with periodontal disease. results: median soluble stimulants of tlr2 and tlr4 were significantly higher in saliva of periodontitis patients compared with saliva of  healthy subjects; 3450 versus 77 ng/ml pam(3) csk(4) equivalents (p<0.0001) and 138 versus 7 ng/ml lps equivalents, respectively (p<0.0001). salivary tlr stimulant levels remained relatively stable in healthy subjects over several days. six strains of oral gram-negative bacteria, including tannerella forsythensis, lysobacter enzymogenes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oris and  porphyromonas gingivalis, from a panel of nine examined did not stimulate tlr4-dependent signalling. conclusions: elevated salivary tlr stimulants may represent a novel mechanism by which periodontitis increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance.

TI  == trends in antibiotic resistance in prevotella species from patients of the university hospital of maxillofacial surgery, sofia, bulgaria, in 2003-2009.
AB  == head-and-neck infections often involve anaerobes such as prevotella species. aim  of the present study was to assess the evolution and the factors associated with  resistance in prevotella species to penicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline and beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (bl/blis). in total, 192  prevotella strains, isolated from patients with oral and head-and-neck infections, were evaluated. common isolates were prevotella intermedia and prevotella melaninogenica within the pigmented species as well as prevotella oris and prevotella oralis group within the non-pigmented species. overall resistance  was 43.2% for penicillin, 10.9% for clindamycin, 0% for metronidazole. nonsusceptibility to tetracycline was 29.1% without significant differences in resistance rates between pigmented and other species. penicillin resistant strains were beta-lactamase positive. from 2003-2004 to 2007-2009, penicillin resistance rates increased about four-fold (from 15.4% to 60.6%). clindamycin resistance did not show evolution, whereas tetracycline nonsusceptibility decreased from 43.3% in 2003-2004 to 20.7% in 2007-2009. except for one (0.5%) p. oralis strain with intermediate susceptibility to bl/blis, the other strains were susceptible to the agents. in conclusion, in prevotella strains from patients with head-and-neck infections, the resistance rate to penicillin increased, that  to clindamycin remained stable and the nonsusceptibility rate to tetracycline decreased during the period. activity against >99% of prevotella strains was observed with metronidazole and bl/blis. the penicillin resistance and tetracycline nonsusceptibility were associated with the year of study, national antibiotic consumption and possibly with previous treatment (for tetracycline). the evolution of penicillin resistance in prevotella strains was highly dynamic.

TI  == prevotella maculosa sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == three strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from human oral sites were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed the strains to constitute a novel group within the genus prevotella, most closely related to prevotella oris and prevotella salivae. a novel species,  prevotella maculosa sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. prevotella maculosa is saccharolytic and produces acetic and succinic acids as end products of fermentation. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 48 mol%. the type strain of prevotella maculosa is w1609(t) (=dsm 19339(t) =ccug 54766(t)).

TI  == development of a novel pcr assay for detection of prevotella oris in clinical specimens.
AB  == prevotella oris is a nonpigmented, gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium that has been associated with several serious oral and systemic infections. prevotella oris has been identified in clinical specimens by bacterial culture and biochemical tests, which are generally unreliable. the aim of this study was to develop a pcr assay for the direct detection of p. oris in clinical specimens. pcr primers specific for p. oris were identified by alignment of bacterial 16s rrna genes from closely related species and selection of pcr primers specific for p. oris at their 3' ends. amplification of a 1110-bp product indicated pcr positivity for p. oris. the primers were shown to be specific for p. oris dna, because no pcr products were obtained when dna from other oral bacteria, including closely related prevotella species, were used as test species, and this was confirmed by digestion of pcr products with rsai and mnli. prevotella oris dna was detected in 17 (36.2%) of 47 pus samples from subjects with dentoalveolar abscesses and in all three pus samples from subjects with spreading odontogenic infections. this pcr assay provides a sensitive, specific and reliable method for identifying p. oris in clinical specimens.

TI  == identification of bacteria associated with spreading odontogenic infections by 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial species associated with spreading odontogenic infections (sois). study design: pus samples from 4 cases of soi were analyzed by microbiological culture methods for the presence of bacteria, and by  polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification, cloning, and sequencing of bacterial 16s rrna genes. results: culture methods identified species from the genera prevotella, streptococcus, and fusobacterium, as well as anaerobic streptococci. molecular detection methods identified a far more diverse microflora. the predominant genus detected was prevotella, representing 102 (50.2%) of 203 clones analyzed. prevotella oris was the most abundant species identified, representing 45 (22.2%) of 203 clones analyzed. twelve clones (5.9%)  represented uncultivable species, namely prevotella pus9.180, an uncultured peptostreptococcus species, and an uncultured bacterium belonging to the bacteroidetes phylum. conclusions: prevotella species may play an important role  in sois, and further work to examine in more detail the pathogenicity determinants of these organisms and associated host responses is warranted.

TI  == prevotella shahii sp. nov. and prevotella salivae sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == two bacterial strains, ehs11(t) and epsa11(t), which were isolated from the human oral cavity, were characterized in terms of phenotypic and biochemical characteristics, cellular fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic position based on  16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of the isolates belonged to a novel species of the genus prevotella. strain ehs11(t) was related to prevotella loescheii (about 95 % similarity), whereas strain epsa11(t) was related to prevotella oris (about 94 % similarity). both strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile,  gram-negative rods. the cellular fatty acid composition of strain epsa11(t) was very similar to that of p. oris jcm 8540(t). on the other hand, the cellular fatty acid composition of strain ehs11(t) was significantly different from those  of other prevotella species. the predominant fatty acids in strain ehs11(t) are c(18 : 1)omega9c, c(16 : 0) and c(16 : 0) 3-oh, whereas other prevotella species, except for p. loescheii jcm 8530(t), possess anteiso-c(15 : 0), iso-c(17 : 0) 3-oh and c(18 : 1)omega9c. the predominant fatty acids in p. loescheii jcm 8530(t) are anteiso-c(15 : 0), c(16 : 0) and c(18 : 1)omega9c. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed a genomic distinction of strains ehs11(t) and  epsa11(t) from p. loescheii jcm 8530(t) and p. oris jcm 8540(t). on the basis of  these data, two novel prevotella species are proposed: prevotella shahii sp. nov. and prevotella salivae sp. nov. the type strains of p. shahii and p. salivae are  ehs11(t) (=jcm 12083(t)=dsm 15611(t)) and epsa11(t) (=jcm 12084(t)=dsm 15606(t)), respectively.

TI  == oro-facial gangrene (noma/cancrum oris): pathogenetic mechanisms.
AB  == cancrum oris (noma) is a devastating infectious disease which destroys the soft and hard tissues of the oral and para-oral structures. the dehumanizing oro-facial gangrenous lesion affects predominantly children ages 2 to 16 years, particularly in sub-saharan africa, where the estimated frequency in some communities varies from 1 to 7 cases per 1000 population. the risk factors are poverty, malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, residential proximity to livestock in unsanitary environments, and infectious diseases, particularly measles and those  due to the herpesviridae. infections and malnutrition impair the immune system, and this is the common denominator for the occurrence of noma. acute necrotizing  gingivitis (ang) and oral herpetic ulcers are considered the antecedent lesions,  and ongoing studies suggest that the rapid progression of these precursor lesions to noma requires infection by a consortium of micro-organisms, with fusobacterium necrophorum (fn) and prevotella intermedia (pi) as the suspected key players. additional to production of a growth-stimulating factor for pi, fn displays a classic endotoxin, a dermonecrotic toxin, a cytoplasmic toxin, and a hemolysin. without appropriate treatment, the mortality rate from noma is 70-90%. survivors  suffer the two-fold afflictions of oro-facial mutilation and functional impairment, which require a time-consuming, financially prohibitive surgical reconstruction.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == pathogenesis of cancrum oris (noma): confounding interactions of malnutrition with infection.
AB  == this study showed that impoverished nigerian children at risk for cancrum oris (noma) had significantly reduced plasma concentrations of zinc (< 10.8 micromol/l), retinol (< 1.05 micromol/l), ascorbate (< 11 micromol/l), and the essential amino acids, with prominently increased plasma and saliva levels of free cortisol, compared with their healthy counterparts. the nutrient deficiencies, in concert with previously reported widespread viral infections (measles, herpesviruses) in the children, would impair oral mucosal immunity. we  postulate, subject to additional studies, that evolution of the oral mucosal ulcers including acute necrotizing gingivitis to noma is triggered by a consortium of microorganisms of which fusobacterium necrophorum is a key component. fusobacterium necrophorum elaborates several dermonecrotic toxic metabolites and is acquired by the impoverished children via fecal contamination  resulting from shared residential facilities with animals and very poor environmental sanitation.

TI  == isolation of fusobacterium necrophorum from cancrum oris (noma).
AB  == a study of the predominant microflora in active sites of noma (cancrum oris) lesions was carried out in eight noma patients 3-15 years of age in sokoto state  in northwestern nigeria. paper point sampling and conventional anaerobic microbiologic techniques were used. fusobacterium necrophorum was recovered from  87.5% of the noma lesions. oral microorganisms included prevotella intermedia, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and actinomyces spp. which were isolated from 75.0%, 50.0%, and 37.5% of the patients, respectively. peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas spp. were each recovered from one lesion. the f. necrophorum and p. intermedia isolates were tested for antibiotic sensitivity to clindamycin, tetracycline, metronidazole, and penicillin using the e-test, and all strains were observed to be sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested with the exception of one strain of p. intermedia,  which showed resistance to penicillin. the first reported isolation from human noma lesions of f. necrophorum, a pathogen primarily associated with animal diseases, may have important etiologic and animal transmission implications.

TI  == fibronectin and laminin binding of urogenital and oral prevotella species.
AB  == 88 strains of five prevotella species--p. bivia, p. buccae, p. disiens, p. oralis, and p. oris--were examined for their fibronectin and laminin binding properties with the aid of latex particle agglutination assays. beside single protein binding activities, all species showed strains that adhered to both fibronectin and laminin. the oral species, p. buccae, p. oralis, and p. oris were found to interact with laminin to a pronouncedly higher extent than with fibronectin. the urogenital species, p. bivia and p. disiens showed comparable activities of binding to fibronectin and laminin, with p. bivia exhibiting higher matrix protein binding rates than p. disiens. within the oral species group, p. oralis showed a higher percentage of fibronectin and laminin reactive strains than did p. buccae and p. oris. the finding of species-related different binding  properties may throw some light on the known differences in clinical relevance and pathogenicity of the urogenital species, p. bivia and p. disiens, but does so only in part concerning the oral species, p. buccae, p. oralis, and p. oris. moreover, the observed differences in matrix protein binding of prevotella species may have implications in chemotaxis and opsonization on the one hand and  maintenance of colonization activities under antibiotic therapy on the other.

TI  == role of human intestinal prevotella oris in hydrolyzing ginseng saponins.
AB  == the potential of intestinal bacteria to hydrolyze ginsenoside rb1 to 20-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-20(s)-protopanaxadiol (i) was found in 79% of the fecal specimens from 58 human subjects whose age ranged from 1 to 64 years. following a ginsenoside-rb1-hydrolyzing activity assay, prevotella oris strains were then isolated as a major bacterial species possessing the potential. all the intestinal isolates converted ginsenosides rb1 and rd to i, ginsenoside rb2 to 20-o-[alpha-l-arabinopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-d-glucopyranosyl]-20(s) -protopanaxadiol (ii), and ginsenoside rc to 20-o-[alpha-l-arabinofuranosyl(1-->6)-beta-d-glucopyranosyl]-20(s)- protopanaxadiol (iii) like fecal microflora, but did not attack ginsenosides re or rg1 (protopanaxatriol-type). the isolates were susceptible to colimycin (mic,  3.13 micrograms/ml) and then the treatment of specific pathogen free mice with colimycin (20 mg/kg/day) decreased intestinal bacterial rb1-hydrolyzing potential from 22.1 +/- 1.2% to 4.7 +/- 2.7%, while the decreased potential was restored to 30.7 +/- 3.7% by the inoculation with p. oris isolates. these results suggest that the metabolism of protopanaxadiol saponins to metabolites i-iii in the intestines seems most partly due to intestinal p.oris. in addition, the fact that neither intact ginsenoside rb1 nor its middle metabolic derivatives but only the  final metabolite i was detected at 1.0-7.3 micrograms/ml in blood after oral administration of mice with ginsenoside rb1 (125 mg/kg) allows us to speculate that metabolites i-iii are the most likely forms of protopanaxadiol saponins absorbed from the intestines.

AB  == oral prevotella and capnocytophaga species, regularly isolated from periodontal pockets and associated with extraoral infections, secret specific immunoglobulin  a1 (iga1) proteases cleaving human iga1 in the hinge region into intact fab and fc fragments. to investigate whether these enzymes are subject to inhibition in vivo in humans, we tested 34 sera from periodontally diseased and healthy individuals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and titers of inhibition of seven prevotella and capnocytophaga proteases. all or nearly all of the sera inhibited the iga1 protease activity of prevotella buccae, prevotella oris, and prevotella loescheii. a minor proportion of the sera inhibited prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, and prevotella melaninogenica iga1 proteases, while no sera inhibited capnocytophaga ochracea iga1 protease. all inhibition titers were low, ranging from 5 to 55, with titer being defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum causing 50% inhibition of one defined unit of protease activity. no correlation between periodontal disease status and the presence, absence, or titer of inhibition was observed. the nature of the low titers of inhibition in all sera of the iga1 proteases of p. buccae, p. oris, and p. loescheii was further examined. in size exclusion chromatography, inhibitory activity corresponded to the peak volume of iga. additional inhibition of the p.  oris iga1 protease was found in fractions containing both iga and igg. purification of the igg fractions of five sera by passage of the sera on a protein g column resulted in recovery of inhibitory igg antibodies against all three iga1 proteases, with the highest titer being for the p. oris enzyme. these  finding indicate that inhibitory activity is associated with enzyme-neutralizing  antibodies.

TI  == evidence for the absence of hyaluronidase activity in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to degrade hyaluronic acid. no hyaluronidase activity was detected using a turbidimetric method, whereas a standard plate assay showed a positive reaction for p. gingivalis. we postulated that the high proteolytic activity of p. gingivalis may account for this observation. a modified plate assay was designed to avoid false-positive reactions caused by proteolytic bacteria. the new assay, based on the formation of a water-insoluble salt between hyaluronic acid and the polyanion cetylpyridinium chloride, indicated that p. gingivalis does not have hyaluronidase activity. by this modified plate method, it was found that among 24 different oral bacterial species tested, propionibacterium acnes and prevotella oris were the only species that possess hyaluronidase activity.

TI  == the use of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of bacteroides intermedius isolates in a dot blot assay.
AB  == bacteroides intermedius includes two distinct groups of organisms that are phenotypically indistinguishable by conventional methods. these two groups are represented by the type strain of the species atcc 25611t (b. intermedius type i) and by atcc 33563 (b. intermedius type ii). members of each group can be distinguished from each other by analysis of the cellular protein composition by  sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and by dna-dna homology studies, because they share less than 40% homology. the purpose of this study was to prepare specific dna probes for the two groups of bacteroides intermedius and  to test them against field isolates. whole-cell dna probes were prepared from b.  intermedius types i and ii and tested against 253 field strains of bacteroides which had been identified by conventional phenotypic tests as b. intermedius. of  these, 170 (67%) hybridized with the b. intermedius type i dna probe, 28 (11%) with the type ii, and 23 (9%) failed to react with the b. intermedius probes but  did hybridize with either b. melaninogenicus, b. loescheii, or b. corporis whole-cell dna probes. the 32 (13%) remaining isolates failed to hybridize with any of the five bacteroides probes or with probes to b. asaccharolyticus, b. buccae, b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. gingivalis, b. oralis, or b. oris. these data demonstrate the usefulness of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of phenotypically similar or identical field isolates.

TI  == infectious oral necrosis (cancrum oris) in nigerian children: a review.
AB  == the devastating orofacial gangrenous disease known as cancrum oris (noma) is still commonly seen in underprivileged nigerian children. these children are usually victims of such stressors as chronic malnutrition, numerous endemic communicable diseases and severe adverse physical conditions which may lead to depletion of their adaptive resources or produce physiological maladaptation to additional stressors. measles is the most common infection preceding the development of noma in nigerian children. acquired immunodeficiency as well as the impaired endocrine balance of the chronically malnourished permits, for example, widespread infection with the measles virus. anergy resulting from the combination of malnutrition and measles virus infection promotes selective overgrowth and invasion by an infective consortium consisting of anaerobic organisms and other species capable of elaborating necessary growth factors for the former. because of the pre-existing depletion of adaptive physiologic resources in the malnourished child, the infection is not readily contained locally as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis but instead spreads rapidly to the next naturally occurring anatomical barriers. this is then followed by continuing necrosis and possible sequestration as exemplified by noma.
