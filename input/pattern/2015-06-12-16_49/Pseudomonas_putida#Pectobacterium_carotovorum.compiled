TI  - Molecular characterization of spoilage bacteria as a means to observe the microbiological quality of carrot.
AB  - This study characterized the bacteria causing decay of carrots during storage and marketing. Spoilage strains were identified by 16S-amplified rDNA restriction analysis and intergenic transcribed spacer-PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-PCR-RFLP). Genotypic fingerprinting by RFLP-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to assess the genetic diversity of the isolates. A total of 252 Pseudomonas isolates from carrots were identified and classified into eight separate groups. Most strains belonged to group A (Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas marginalis, and Pseudomonas veronii) and group B (Pseudomonas putida). The strains identified as Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, Pectobacterium atrosepticum, Dickeya chrysanthemi, and Erwinia rhapontici were distinguished by ITS-PCR-RFLP. All isolates belonging to the genera Pectobacterium and Erwinia were responsible for carrot spoilage. This work has led to the development of new strategies for the identification and genotyping of vegetable-spoiling strains of Pseudomonas, Pectobacterium, and Erwinia. This is also the first report describing the occurrence of carrot-spoiling E. rhapontici. Early recognition of spoilage bacteria in vegetables is important for the implementation of effective handling strategies. Pectolytic bacteria may cause considerable financial losses because they account for a large proportion of bacterial rot of fruits and vegetables during storage, transit, and marketing.
TI  - Suppressing Erwinia carotovora pathogenicity by projecting N-acyl homoserine lactonase onto the surface of Pseudomonas putida cells.
AB  - N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) serve as the vital quorum-sensing signals that  regulate the virulence of the pathogenic bacterium Erwinia carotovora. In the present study, an approach to efficiently restrain the pathogenicity of E. carotovora-induced soft rot disease is described. Bacillus thuringiensis-derived N-acyl homoserine lactonase (AiiA) was projected onto the surface of Pseudomonas putida cells, and inoculation with both strains was challenged. The previously identified N-terminal moiety of the ice nucleation protein, InaQ-N, was applied as the anchoring motif. A surface display cassette with inaQ-N/ aiiA was constructed and expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter in P. putida AB92019. Surface localization of the fusion protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. The antagonistic activity of P. putida MB116 expressing InaQ-N/AiiA toward E. carotovora ATCC25270 was evaluated by challenge inoculation in potato slices at different ratios. The results revealed a remarkable suppressing effect on E. carotovora infection. The active component was further analyzed using different cell fractions, and the cell surface-projected fusion protein was found to correspond to the suppressing effect.
TI  - Draft genome sequence of the biocontrol bacterium Pseudomonas putida B001, an oligotrophic bacterium that induces systemic resistance to plant diseases.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida B001 is a rhizobacterium that was isolated on the basis of its abilities to grow under low-nutrient conditions and induce systemic resistance against bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases of plants. Here we report the draft genome sequence and automatic annotation of strain B001. Comparison of this sequence to the sequenced genome of P. putida KT2440 points to a subset of gene functions that may be related to the defense-inducing functions of B001.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the metal ion-dependent L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidase encoded by bacteriophage T5.
AB  - Although bacteriophage T5 is known to have lytic proteins for cell wall hydrolysis and phage progeny escape, their activities are still unknown. This is the first report on the cloning, expression and biochemical characterization of a bacteriophage T5 lytic hydrolase. The endolysin-encoding lys gene of virulent coliphage T5 was cloned in Escherichia coli cells, and an electrophoretically homogeneous product of this gene was obtained with a high yield (78% of total activity). The protein purified was shown to be an L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidase. The enzyme demonstrated maximal activity in diluted buffers (25-50 mM) at pH 8.5. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by EDTA and BAPTA, and fully reactivated by calcium/manganese chlorides. It was found that, along with E. coli peptidoglycan, peptidase of bacteriophage T5 can lyse peptidoglycans of other Gram-negative microorganisms (Pectobacterium carotovorum, Pseudomonas putida, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis). This endolysin is the first example of an L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidase in a virulent phage infecting Gram-negative bacteria. There are, however, a great many sequences in databases that are highly similar to that of bacteriophage T5 hydrolase, indicating a wide distribution of endolytic L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidases. The article discusses how an enzyme with such substrate specificity could be fixed in the process of evolution.
TI  - Early responses of tobacco suspension cells to rhizobacterial elicitors of induced systemic resistance.
AB  - Colonization of roots by selected strains of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. can trigger induced systemic resistance (ISR) against foliar pathogens in a plant species-specific manner. It has been suggested that early responses in cell suspension cultures in response to rhizobacterial elicitors, such as generation of active oxygen species (AOS) and extracellular medium alkalinization (MA), are linked to the development of ISR in whole plants. Perception of flagellin was demonstrated to elicit ISR in Arabidopsis, and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) have been shown to elicit several defense responses and to act as bacterial determinants of ISR in various plant species. In the present study, the LPS-containing cell walls, the pyoverdine siderophores, and the flagella of Pseudomonas putida WCS358, P. fluorescens WCS374, and P. fluorescens WCS417, which are all known to act as elicitors of ISR in selected plant species, were tested for their effects on the production of AOS, MA, elevation of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](cyt)), and defense-related gene expression in tobacco suspension cells. The LPS of all three strains, the siderophore of WCS374, and the flagella of WCS358 induced a single, transient, early burst of AOS, whereas the siderophores of WCS358 and WCS417 and the flagella of WCS374 and WCS417 did not. None of the compounds caused cell death. Once stimulated by the active compounds, the cells became refractory to further stimulation by any of the active elicitors, but not to the elicitor cryptogein from the oomycete Phytophthora cryptogea, indicating that signaling upon perception of the different rhizobacterial compounds rapidly converges into a common response pathway. Of all compounds tested, only the siderophores of WCS358 and WCS417 did not induce MA; the flagella of WCS374 and WCS417, although not active as elicitors of AOS, did induce MA. These results were corroborated by using preparations from relevant bacterial mutants. The active rhizobacterial elicitors led to a rapid increase in [Ca(2+)](cyt), peaking at 6 min, whereas the inactive siderophores of WCS358 and WCS417 elicited a single spike at 1 min. Elicitation of the cells by cell-wall LPS of WCS358 or the siderophore of WCS374 induced a weak, transient expression of several defense-related genes, including PAL and GST. The spectrum of early responses of the suspension cells was not matched by the expression of ISR in whole tobacco plants against Erwinia carotovora pv. carotovora. Of the live bacterial strains, only WCS358 elicited significant ISR, but application of the LPS or the siderophore of all three strains also elicited ISR. Notably, the absence of elicitation of AOS and MA in suspension-cultured cells but induction of ISR in whole plants by the siderophore of WCS358, which was lost upon treatment with the siderophore-minus mutant of WCS358, indicates that the early responses in suspension cells are not predictive of the ability to induce ISR in whole plants. Possible explanations for these discrepancies are discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis and comparison of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium,  Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida were determined; the DNA sequences of the lexA genes from these bacteria were 86%, 76%, 61% and 59% similar, respectively, to the Escherichia coli K12 gene. The predicted amino acid sequences of the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora and P. putida LexA proteins are 202 residues long whereas that of P. aeruginosa is 204. Two putative LexA repressor binding sites were localized upstream of each of the heterologous genes, the distance between them being 5 bp in S. typhimurium and E. carotovora, as in the lexA gene of E. coli, and 3 bp in P. putida and P. aeruginosa. The first lexA site present in the lexA operator of all five bacteria is very well conserved. However, the second lexA box is considerably more variable. The Ala-84--Gly-85 bond, at which the LexA repressor of E. coli is cleaved during the induction of the SOS response, is also found in the LexA proteins of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora. Likewise, the amino acids Ser-119 and Lys-156 are present in all of these three LexA repressors. These residues also exist in the LexA proteins of P. putida and P. aeruginosa, but they are displaced by 4 and 6 residues, respectively. Furthermore, the structure and sequence of the DNA-binding domain of the LexA repressor of E. coli are highly conserved in the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora, P. aeruginosa and P. putida LexA proteins.
