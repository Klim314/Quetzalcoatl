TI  == culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic.
AB  == to determine whether the culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic is of importance, bacterial cultures were obtained in a consecutive series of 96 patients. routine bacteriologic cultures were performed within 1 hour of collection. ureaplasma urealyticum (t-mycoplasma) cultures were also obtained in  the last 31 of the patients in this series. of these 96 patients, 11% showed significant bacterial growth (greater than 10(4) colonies/ml) in the semen specimens, 8% in those patients with normal semen analyses and 14% in those with  abnormal analyses. fifty-eight per cent of semen specimens were positive for u. urealyticum. in reference to normal and abnormal semen analyses the distribution  was the same regardless of the presence or absence of u. urealyticum. antibiotic  treatment resulted in minor changes in motility and morphology in a few patients  despite conversion to a negative culture. cultures were also coordinated with microscopic urinalysis and the presence of white blood cells or bacteria in stained smears of semen. there were no significant differences between groups with positive or negative cultures. trichomonas vaginalis was not seen.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  == semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group a) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group b). these 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group a were positive and 73% from group b were positive. mixed bacterial flora were isolated  from both groups but in group b they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group a. staphylococcus epidermidis, staph. aureus, corynebacterium species, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group a. group b revealed these organisma plus streptococcus pneumoniae type iii, strep. pyogenes group a, strep. feacalis, escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus species, and eubacterium species. semen samples from group a were of better quality than those from group  b. in addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group a was greater than that from group b.
