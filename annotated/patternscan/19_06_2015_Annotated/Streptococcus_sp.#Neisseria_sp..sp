TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == microbiological quality of indoor air in university libraries.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the concentration of bacteria and fungi in the indoor environment of jimma university libraries, so as to estimate the health hazard and to create standards for indoor air quality control. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of eight libraries of jimma university was determined. the  settle plate method using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed to collect sample twice daily. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: the concentrations of bacteria and fungi aerosols in the indoor environment of the university libraries ranged between 367-2595 cfu/m(3). according to the sanitary standards classification of european commission, almost all the libraries indoor air of jimma university was heavily contaminated with bacteria and fungi. in spite of their major source difference,  the average fungi density found in the indoor air of libraries did appear to follow the same trend with bacterial density (p=0.001). the bacteria isolates included micrococcus sp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus sp. and neisseria sp. while cladosporium sp., alternaria sp., penicillium sp. and aspergillus sp. were the most isolated fungi. conclusions: the indoor air of all  libraries were in the range above highly contaminated according to european commission classification and the most isolates are considered as potential candidates involved in the establishment of sick building syndromes and often associated with clinical manifestations like allergy, rhinitis, asthma and conjunctivitis. thus, attention must be given to control those environmental factors which favor the growth and multiplication of microbes in indoor environment of libraries to safeguard the health of users and workers.

TI  == diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (pid): intra-operative findings and comparison of vaginal and intra-abdominal cultures.
AB  == introduction: pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is frequent in adolescents and younger women. diagnosis is usually based on the clinical findings, and the threshold for empiric antibiotic therapy should be low. however, at least in cases of resistance toward therapy or deterioration of symptoms, laparoscopic evaluation can be helpful. methods: we searched the hospital charts for in-house  patients who were treated for pid or tubo-ovarian abscess between 2007 and 2010.  in cases with both vaginal and intra-abdominal bacterial cultures, results of those were compared. results: 73 patients with suspected pid or tubo-ovarian abscess were included. median patients' age was 40 years (18-88), 18 of 73 (24.7  %) patients had an iud at the time of consultation. 58 patients underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy. in 41 patients (70.7 %) tubo-ovarian abscess could be  confirmed, four patients had differential gynecologic diagnoses, and two patients appendicitis. in vaginal swabs, most frequent bacteria were streptococcus sp. (28.5 %), escherichia coli (22.2 %), enterococcus faecalis (15.9 %), and staphylococcus sp. (9.5 %). in eight patients (11 %) chlamydia trachomatis could  be found, there was no case of neisseria gonorrhea. in 33 patients both vaginal and abdominal cultures were available. in nine cases (27.3 %), identical bacteria could be found, however, 11 cases (33.3 %) showed different results. conclusion:  in severe cases of pid, laparoscopic evaluation and taking an intra-abdominal bacterial culture are helpful for the confirmation of diagnosis, accurate microbiologic testing and specific therapy.

TI  == the cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == epidemiologic pattern of meningococcal meningitis in northern cameroon in 2007-2010: contribution of pcr-enhanced surveillance.
AB  == objectives: monitoring acute bacterial meningitis in northern cameroon. methods:  health professionals collected cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens from patients  presenting with clinical symptoms of meningitis. specimens were tested using gram stain, latex agglutination test, and culture. a pcr assay completed the diagnostic testing. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was performed on some neisseria meningitidis (nm) isolates. results: from 2007 through 2010, of the 1429 csf specimens tested, 292 (20.4%) were positive, either for nm (205), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) (57), or haemophilus influenzae (hi) (30). from 2007 through 2009, the serogroup w135 represented 98.8% of 164 case isolates. until 2008, most serogroup w135 isolates presented the sequence-type st-2881 usually associated with sporadic cases. since 2009, the st-11 (an epidemic-associated clone) became predominant, although no epidemic occurred. serogroup a st-7 was observed in 2010 and caused a localized epidemic. using the  detection pcr on turbid csf, a 2.7-fold increase in cases with etiologic diagnosis was obtained, compared to culture. all tested meningococcal isolates (42) were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cefotaxim. conclusions: resurgence of serogroup a and recent increase in st-11 among serogroup w135 isolates were worrying when considered with the epidemic wave of serogroup a meningitis, which affected neighboring countries and the serogroup w135 epidemic  in niger in 2009-2010.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == the formyl peptide receptor like-1 and scavenger receptor marco are involved in glial cell activation in bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background: recent studies have suggested that the scavenger receptor marco (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure) mediates activation of the immune response in bacterial infection of the central nervous system (cns). the chemotactic g-protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) formyl-peptide-receptor like-1 (fprl1) plays an essential role in the inflammatory responses of host defence mechanisms and neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer's disease (ad). expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin cramp/ll-37 is up-regulated  in bacterial meningitis, but the mechanisms underlying cramp expression are far from clear. methods: using a rat meningitis model, we investigated the influence  of marco and fprl1 on rcramp (rat cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide) expression after infection with bacterial supernatants of streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) and neisseria meningitides (nm). expression of fprl1 and marco was analyzed by immunofluorescence and real-time rt-pcr in a rat meningitis model. furthermore, we examined the receptor involvement by real-time rt-pcr, extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1/2 (erk1/2) phosphorylation and camp level measurement in glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) and transfected hek293 cells using receptor deactivation by antagonists. receptors were inhibited by small interference rna and the consequences in nm- and sp-induced camp (rcramp gene) expression and signal transduction were determined. results: we show an nm-induced increase of marco expression by immunofluorescence and real-time rt-pcr in glial and meningeal cells. receptor deactivation by antagonists and small interfering rna (sirna) verified the importance of fprl1 and marco for nm-  and sp-induced camp and interleukin-1beta expression in glial cells. furthermore, we demonstrated a functional interaction between fprl1 and marco in nm-induced signalling by real-time rt-pcr, erk1/2 phosphorylation and camp level measurement and show differences between nm- or sp-induced signal transduction. conclusions:  we propose that nm and sp induce glial cell activation and rcramp expression also via fprl1 and marco. thus the receptors contribute an important part to the host  defence against infection.

TI  == anti-bacterial activity of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: comparative in vitro study of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine,  and azithromycin.
AB  == background: intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) is recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub-saharan africa. increasing drug resistance necessitates the urgent evaluation of alternative drugs. currently, the most promising candidates  in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. besides the anti-malarial activity, sp is also a potent antibiotic and incurs significant anti-microbial activity when given as iptp - though systematic clinical evaluation of this action is still lacking. methods: in this study, the intrinsic anti-bacterial activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy in a standard microdilution assay. results: sp was highly active against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. all tested gram-positive bacteria, except enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. additionally, azithromycin was active against neisseria gonorrhoeae. mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro action against all other tested pathogens. conclusion: these data indicate  important differences in the spectrum of anti-bacterial activity for the evaluated anti-malarial drugs. given the large scale use of iptp in africa, the need for prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact of antibiotic activity of anti-malarials on maternal and foetal health and on the risk of promoting specific drug resistance of bacterial pathogens is discussed.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == african meningitis belt pneumococcal disease epidemiology indicates a need for an effective serotype 1 containing vaccine, including for older children and adults.
AB  == background: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine strategies in gavi-eligible countries  are focusing on infant immunization but this strategy may not be optimal in all settings. we aimed to collect all available population based data on pneumococcal meningitis throughout life in the african meningitis belt and then to model overall meningitis risk to help inform vaccine policy. methods: after a systematic review of literature published from 1970 through the present, we found robust population-based streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) meningitis data across age  strata for four african meningitis belt countries that included 35 surveillance years spanning from 1970 to 2005. using these data we modeled disease risk for a  hypothetical cohort of 100,000 persons followed throughout life. results: similar to meningococcal meningitis, laboratory-confirmed pneumococcal meningitis was seasonal, occurring primarily in the dry season. the mean annual sp meningitis incidence rates were 98, 7.8 to 14, and 5.8 to 12 per 100,000 among persons <1, 1 through 19, and 20 to 99 years of age, respectively, which (in the absence of major epidemics) were higher than meningococcal meningitis incidences for persons less than 1 and over 20 years of age. mean sp meningitis case fatality ratios (cfr) among hospitalized patients ranged from 36-66% depending on the age group,  with cfr exceeding 60% for all age groups beyond 40 years; depending on the age group, sp meningitis mortality incidences were 2 to 12-fold greater than those for meningococcal meningitis. the lifetime risks of pneumococcal meningitis disease and death were 0.6% (1 in 170) and 0.3% (1 in 304), respectively. the incidences of these outcomes were highest among children age <1 year. however, the cumulative risk was highest among persons age 5 to 59 years who experienced 59% of pneumococcal meningitis outcomes. after age 5 years and depending on the country, 59-79% of meningitis cases were caused by serotype 1. conclusions: in the african meningitis belt, sp is as important a cause of meningitis as neisseria meningitidis, particularly among older children and working age adults. the meningitis belt population needs an effective serotype 1 containing vaccine and policy discussions should consider vaccine use outside of early childhood.

(7.30-/+0.89 copies/ml) and veillonella sp. (8.29-/+0.77 copies/ml) in group t were significantly lower than those in group n (8.15-/+0.55 and 8.93-/+0.76 copies/ml, respectively, p<0.01), but similar with those in group c. the quantity of streptococcus sp. (7.51-/+0.81 copies/ml) in group c was significantly lower than that in group n (8.15-/+0.55 copies/ml, p<0.01), but the quantity of veillonella sp. was similar between the two groups. no significant difference were found in the quantity of neisseria sp. between the 3 groups. conclusion: the quantity of oral microflora differs significantly between patients with recurrent oral ulcers and normal individuals, suggesting a possible correlation between oral microfora and recurrent oral ulcers.

TI  == adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

TI  == a pneumococcal merr-like regulator and s-nitrosoglutathione reductase are required for systemic virulence.
AB  == a transcriptional regulator, nmlr(sp), has been identified in streptococcus pneumoniae that is required for defense against nitric oxide (no) stress. the nmlr(sp) gene is cotranscribed with adhc, which encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase  that is able to reduce s-nitrosoglutathione (gsno) with nadh as reductant. nmlr(sp) and adhc mutants exhibited a reduced level of nadh-gsno oxidoreductase activity and were more susceptible to killing by no than were wild-type cells. comparison of the virulence of wild-type and mutant strains by use of a mouse model system showed that nmlr(sp) and adhc do not play a key role in the adherence of pneumococci to the nasopharynx in vivo. an intraperitoneal challenge experiment revealed that both nmlr(sp) and adhc were required for survival in blood. these data identify novel components of a no defense system in pneumococci that are required for systemic infection.

TI  == regulation of constitutive and microbial pathogen-induced human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) gene expression.
AB  == the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) is an important regulator of innate immunity, inflammation and oncogenesis. however, four decades after its identification, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating the expression of the mif gene remain largely unknown. analyses of human monocytic (thp-1), epithelial (hela and a549) and keratinocytic (hacat) cells transfected with wild-type, truncated and mutated mif promoter reporter constructs, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and sirna inhibition indicated that the transcription factors specificity protein (sp)1 and camp response element-binding protein (creb) are critical positive regulators of  constitutive human mif gene expression. albeit located in a cytosine guanine dinucleotide island, the mif gene was found to be hypomethylated, an observation  consistent with high baseline transcriptional activity. moreover, stimulation of  thp-1 cells and of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with microbial products up-regulated phosphorylated sp1 nuclear content, sp1 dna-binding activity, mif promoter activity and mif mrna levels in a mek1/2-, sp1-dependent manner. taken together with previous observations of an important role for mif in pro-inflammatory macrophage responses, these present findings suggest a key role  for sp1 and creb in transcriptional regulation of mif gene expression and mif-dependent host antimicrobial innate immune defense.

AB  == introduction: acute bacterial meningitis (abm) is one of the most severe diseases in sub-saharan africa. although data for the continent is very limited, more than one million cases are estimated per year, with mortality and life-long sequelae occurring in 50% of these cases. methods: as part of the clinical management of children admitted to the manhica district hospital, information on cases of abm was recorded. we analysed data from june 1998 to november 2003. results: during the study period, 475 cerebrospinal-fluid (csf) samples were collected from 20,173 children <15 years of age admitted to hospital. culture results confirmed  71 (15%) cases of abm. the most prevalent bacterial aetiologies were streptotoccus pneumoniae (pneumococcus, n=31), haemophilus influenzae (n=13) and  neisseria meningitis (n=8). other important bacteria were streptococcus sp. (n=7), salmonella sp. (n=4) and staphylococcus aureus (n=3). crude incidence rates of abm and pneumococcal meningitis were 20/100,000 and 10/100,000 children-year-at-risk, respectively. incidences were more than three times higher in the <1 year age group. overall case fatality rate was 36%, and was highest for h. influenzae and pneumococcal meningitis (55% and 45%, respectively, p=0.044). pneumococcal susceptibility was 81% for oxacillin and 93% for chloramphenicol. for h. influenzae isolates, susceptibility was 54% for ampicillin and 62% for chloramphenicol. conclusions: s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae are the main aetiologies responsible for the high burden of morbidity and mortality associated with abm in rural mozambique. these findings are important to evaluate treatment  guidelines and potential impact of control measures.

TI  == acute bacterial meningitis at the 'complexe pediatrique' of bangui, central african republic.
AB  == to precis the aetiologies of children meningitis and the susceptibility to antibiotics of bacteria responsible for meningitis in bangui, we conducted a prospective study between october 2004 and september 2005, at the 'complexe pediatrique de bangui', central african republic (car). children from 1 day to 16 years with suspected meningitis and who underwent a lumbar puncture were enrolled. gram staining, culture on chocolate blood medium, cell count, biochemistry (protein level, glucose ratio), capsular antigen detection were performed for each cerebrospinal fluid. mics were determined by the e-test method. four hundred and seventeen patients were enrolled during the study period; 130 were proven acute bacterial meningitis and 37 probable bacterial meningitis. among proven bacterial meningitis, streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common organism responsible for meningitis (62 cases, 48%) followed by haemophilus influenzae (46 cases, 35%) and by neisseria meningitidis and salmonella sp. (8 cases, 6% each). ninety-four percent and 96% of s. pneumoniae strains tested remain susceptible to benzylpenicilline and chloramphenicol, respectively. a beta-lactamase was detected in 92% of h. influenzae strains tested. however, mics 50% and 90% for amoxicillin were found to be 1 and 4 mg/l,  respectively and 33% of these strains were resistant to chloramphenicol. the global mortality rate was 35% (59/167). this mortality rate was 47% for s. pneumoniae, 33% for h. influenzae, 62% for salmonella sp. and 13% for n. meningitidis. the probabilistic treatment with ampicillin and chloramphenicol usually administered for children meningitis in bangui must be reconsidered particularly in cases of h. influenzae meningitis. it is of importance to reduce  the presentation delays of children with suspected meningitis in bangui. the h. influenzae b immunization would allow a dramatic reduction of meningitis cases and deaths in central african children.

TI  == intranasal vaccines for protection against respiratory and systemic bacterial infections.
AB  == more than 4 million deaths per year are due to respiratory diseases. although licensed vaccines are available, bacteria, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, bordetella pertussis and neisseria meningiditis, among others, continue to be the major agents of diseases in young children, the elderly and/or immunocompromized individuals. following respiratory tract infection, some microorganisms may also invade the epithelial tissue, achieving systemic circulation and/or other organs. nasal administration  of different antigen formulations has shown promising results in the induction of immune responses and the defeat of the pathogens at the site of infection. this review will focus on the main nasal vaccine strategies and technologies being investigated against the most common infections caused by respiratory bacteria.

TI  == differential identification of bacillus anthracis from environmental bacillus species using microarray analysis.
AB  == aims: to determine whether microarray analysis could be employed for the differential identification of a range of environmental bacillus sp. from four strains of bacillus anthracis. methods and results: oligonucleotide probes were designed that were specific to virulence factor genes of b. anthracis (pag, lef and cap), the variable number tandem repeat region of the b. anthracis vrra gene  and to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region (its) and pleiotropic regulator (plcr) regions of the bacillus cereus subgroup species. generic probes were also designed to hybridize with conserved regions of the 16s  rrna genes of bacillus (as a positive control), neisseria sp., pseudomonas sp., streptococcus sp., mycobacterium sp. and to all members of the enterobacteriaceae to allow simultaneous detection of these bacteria. identification of b. anthracis was found to rely entirely on hybridization of dna specific to regions of the pag, lef and cap genes. cross-reaction was observed between b. anthracis and other bacillus species with all the other bacillus probes tested. results obtained using microarray hybridizations were confirmed using conventional microbiological techniques and found to have very high comparability. conclusions: microarray-based assays are an effective method for the identification of b. anthracis from mixed-culture environmental samples without problems of false-positivity that have been observed with conventional pcr assays. significance and impact of the study: identification of environmental bacillus sp. by conventional pcr is prone to potential for reporting false-positives. this study provides a method for the exclusion of such isolates.

TI  == incidence and behaviour of tn916-like elements within tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated from root canals.
AB  == introduction: tetracycline resistance is commonly found in endodontic bacteria. one of the most common tetracycline-resistance genes is tet(m), which is often encoded on the broad-host-range conjugative transposon tn916. this study aimed to determine whether tet(m) was present in bacteria isolated from endodontic patients at the eastman dental institute and whether this gene was carried on the transferable conjugative transposon tn916. methods: the cultivable microflora isolated from 15 endodontic patients was screened for resistance to tetracycline. polymerase chain reactions for tet(m) and for unique regions of tn916 were carried out on the dna of all tetracycline-resistant bacteria. filter-mating experiments were used to see if transfer of any tn916-like elements could occur.  results: eight out of 15 tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated were shown to possess tet(m). furthermore, four of these eight were shown to possess the tn916-unique regions linked to the tet(m) gene. transfer experiments demonstrated that a neisseria sp. donor could transfer an extremely unstable tn916-like element to enterococcus faecalis. conclusions: the tet(m) gene is present in the  majority of tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated in this study and the conjugative transposon tn916 has been shown to be responsible for the support and transfer of this gene in some of the bacteria isolated.

TI  == antineoplastic agents. 554. the manitoba bacterium streptomyces sp.
AB  == a streptomyces sp. isolated from riverbank soil in manitoba, canada, was found to contain two cancer cell growth inhibitories: diazaanthraquinone 1 and 3-(hydroxyacetyl)indole (8). the structures were determined by interpretation of  data from hrms, uv, and high-field (400 mhz) nmr experiments. the red-colored diazaanthraquinone 1 and 3-(hydroxyacetyl)indole (8) were found to inhibit (0.1-3 microg/ml) growth of a minipanel of human cancer cell lines and p388 lymphocytic  leukemia cells. diazaanthraquinone 1 was also found to inhibit growth of the bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria gonorrheae. however, three companion constituents, cyclo-pro-leu (5), cyclo-pro-phe (6), and cyclo-pro-val (7), did not inhibit cancer cell growth.

TI  == molecular characterization of subject-specific oral microflora during initial colonization of enamel.
AB  == the initial microbial colonization of tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. characterization of the initial microflora is the first step in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. a total of 531 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes  were identified. microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. in all subjects, however, 4-h and 8-h communities were  dominated by streptococcus spp. belonging to the streptococcus oralis/streptococcus mitis group. other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5% of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were actinomyces, gemella, granulicatella, neisseria, prevotella, rothia, and veillonella. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) confirmed that the proportion of streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. fish also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only streptococcus spp. but also the rarer prevotella spp. were usually seen in small multigeneric clusters of cells. this study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject  is unique in terms of diversity and composition. repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner.

TI  == bacterial profile and clinical outcome of childhood meningitis in rural yemen: a  2-year hospital-based study.
AB  == background: childhood acute bacterial meningitis (abm) is an important cause of death and long-term neurological disability in yemen, the only low income-high mortality country in the arabian peninsula. the objective of this study was to document the microbial characteristics, the antibacterial sensitivity pattern, and the outcome for children hospitalized with abm, prior to the introduction of  haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) vaccine in yemen. patients and methods: the study was retrospective, conducted at a rural district hospital, serving the rural population of the northern parts of yemen. all patients aged 1 month-15 years admitted between may 1999 and june 2001, with clinical evidence of meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) cultured, were included in the study. clinical information from case notes, including csf result and the outcome on discharge, were obtained. analysis of extracted data was performed using epi info software. results: during the 2-year study period, 160 study patients met the inclusion criteria, and 7 (4.4%) were negative for bacterial growth. in the 153 positive cultures there were 46 (30.1%) streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), 23 (15%) h. influenzae (hi), 81 (52.9) neisseria meningitidis (nm), 2 (1.3%) staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), and 1 (0.7%) escherichia coli. sixteen study patients died (overall case fatality rate (cfr) 10%), 7 aged under 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 3 more than 60 months. ten deaths were due to sp meningitis, 2 hi meningitis, 3 nm meningitis, and 1 had s. aureus. of the 144 survivors, 28 (19.4%) developed permanent neurological complications, 17 aged less than 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 5 more than 60 months. sp meningitis accounted for 57.1% (16/28), and 6 (21.4%) had hi meningitis. among the 89 aged 1-60 months, 13 died (cfr 14.6%), and 23 (30.3%) of the 76 survivors  developed permanent complications. of those tested 20% and 35% of the 20 hi tested isolates and 9.5% and 14.3% of the 42 sp isolates, were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin g, respectively, and the majority of the 81 nm isolates were sensitive to both. the 3 pathogens were largely resistant to gentamicin, and almost all were susceptible to chloramphenicol and cefotaxime. conclusion: in contrast to the studies from the low-mortality countries of the region, our study showed that the predominant pathogens of childhood abm were sp and nm. sp meningitis was associated with increased mortality and permanent disability.

TI  == simultaneous detection of neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus sp. by polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == the simultaneous detection of neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus sp. was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, as well as the applicability of pcr as a routine test. a cohort study was carried out with 182 children (2 months to 12 years of age) with suspicion of bacterial meningitis. routine tests identified the etiologic agent in 65/84 children whose clinical status and laboratory findings suggested the presence of bacterial meningitis. bacterial meningitis was ruled out in 98 children. in 19 children, the etiologic diagnosis was not possible using standard methods; in 14 of these patients, the etiologic agent was identified by pcr (n. meningitidis=12; h. influenzae=1; streptococcus sp.=1). the sensitivity of pcr was 88.1%; specificity, 99.0%; positive predictive value, 98.7%; and negative predictive, 90.1%. pcr is a useful complementary diagnostic technique, especially when gram stain, culture, or antigenic detection are negative or inconclusive.

TI  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. the mic90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), morexella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, legionella sp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, clamydia pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), listeria sp., most enterobacteriaceae, salmonella sp., shigella sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. menigitidis, pasteurella  spp., vibrio spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. for mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia sp., serratia sp., p. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive gram-negative rods, mic90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. for anaerobic bacteria species, mic90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the mic and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. there is a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the mic and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. a single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h,  auc of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 l/kg. protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (m-1 and m-2). bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. no dose  modification is required in renal impairment. extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. at present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with mics of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. the safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.

TI  == heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine conjugated to outer membrane protein of neisseria meningitidis serogroup b and nasopharyngeal carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae in infants.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) is an important bacterial pathogen in children. nasopharyngeal (np) colonization of s. pneumoniae is necessary for person-to-person transmission and often precedes invasive disease. methods: np carriage of sp was studied in 49 infants following administration of a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv) conjugated to the outer membrane protein of serogroup b neisseria meningitidis (vaccine serotypes: 4, 6b, 9v, 14,  18c, 19f, 23f). the vaccine was administered at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age and carriage rates were compared to a concurrent group of 32 infants not given pcv and evaluated over the first 15 months of life. results: overall, sp was isolated in 86/367 (23%) of np cultures and 49% of infants. serotype 23f was significantly less prevalent in the pcv group (1.9%) than the control group (16.1%) (p<0.05). analysis of the proportion of children with prevalent carriage or acquisition of  carriage did not differ between groups when evaluated by age or serotype. we noted, however, decreased acquisition and carriage in the vaccine group 1 month following the 12 month dose of pcv for vaccine serotypes (76 and 52% reduction, respectively), but this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.3). adjustment for age, daycare and antibiotic use by multivariate modeling revealed  no difference in carriage of vaccine containing serotypes or non-vaccine serotypes between groups. conclusion: we did not show a significant effect of this heptavalent pcv on np carriage. further study of this issue, including a larger population size, is needed.

TI  == employment of broad-range 16s rrna pcr to detect aetiological agents of infection from clinical specimens in patients with acute meningitis--rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons without the need for cloning.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to develop a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) method for the rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons from aetiological agents of acute meningitis. methods and results: blood samples from  40 patients with suspected acute meningococcal meningitis were examined for the presence of causal agents, including neisseria meningitidis employing two methods: (i) broad-range 16s rrna pcr in conjunction with page and automated sequencing and (ii) species-specific pcr employing abi taqman technology for n. meningitidis. analysis of clinical specimens employing 16s rrna pcr yielded 33/40 (82.5%) positive for the presence of bacterial dna. species-specific pcr yielded  30/40 (75%) clinical specimens positive for n. meningitidis. prior to separation  by page, only 6/33 (18.2%) amplicons were able to be identified by sequence analysis, the remaining amplicons (n=27) did not yield an identification due to the presence of mixed 16s rrna pcr amplicons. following separation, amplicons were re-amplified and sequenced, yielding 24/27 (88.9%) positive for n. meningitidis and three specimens positive for acinetobacter sp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. one specimen was positive for both n. meningitidis and streptococcus spp. and another specimen was positive for n. meningitidis and pseudomonas sp., by broad-range pcr. seven clinical specimens were negative for n. meningitidis and other eubacteria using both detection techniques. conclusions: clinical specimens including blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, may become contaminated with commensal skin flora, resulting in difficulties in downstream sequencing of pathogen plus contaminant dna. this study allows for the rapid separation of amplified pathogen from contaminant dna. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrated the usefulness of the rapid separation of multiple 16s rrna pcr amplicons using a combination of page and automated sequencing, without the need of cloning. adoption of this technique is therefore proposed when trying to rapidly identify pathogens in clinical specimens employing broad-range 16s rrna pcr.

TI  == biofilm dispersal of neisseria subflava and other phylogenetically diverse oral bacteria.
AB  == polystyrene petri dishes containing liquid medium were inoculated with single-cell suspensions of a fresh clinical isolate of neisseria subflava and were incubated under conditions of low vibration. n. subflava colonies grew firmly attached to the surface of the dish, while the broth remained clear. growing colonies released cells into the medium, resulting in the appearance of 10(2) to 10(4) small satellite colonies attached to the surface of the dish in an area adjacent to each mature colony after 24 h. satellite colonies grew in patterns of streamers shaped like jets and flares emanating from mature colonies  and pointing toward the center of the dish. this dispersal pattern evidently resulted from the surface translocation of detached biofilm cells by buoyancy-driven convection currents that were generated due to slight temperature gradients in the medium. streamers of satellite colonies ranged from 2 to >40 mm  in length. satellite colonies in very long streamers were relatively uniform in size regardless of their distance from the mature colony, suggesting that mature  colonies released single cells or small clusters of cells into the medium and that the detachment, surface translocation, and subsequent surface reattachment of released cells were a transitory process. incubation of n. subflava single cells in a perfused biofilm fermentor resulted in a large spike of the number of  cfu in the perfusate after 9.5 h of growth, consistent with a rapid release of cells into the medium. biofilm colonies of several other phylogenetically diverse oral bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, streptococcus mitis, and a prevalent but previously uncultured oral  streptococcus sp., exhibited similar temperature-dependent dispersal patterns in  broth culture. this in vitro spreading phenotype could be a useful tool for studying biofilm dispersal in these and other nonflagellated bacteria and may have physiological relevance to biofilm dispersal in the oral cavity.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16s ribosomal dna bacterial genes from dna isolated from advanced noma lesions of four nigerian children were pcr amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into escherichia coli. partial 16s rrna sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine  species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. a total of 67 bacterial  species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including propionibacterium acnes,  staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. other known species that were detected included achromobacter spp., afipia spp., brevundimonas diminuta, capnocytophaga spp., cardiobacterium sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium spp., gemella haemoylsans, and neisseria spp. phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera eubacterium, flavobacterium, kocuria, microbacterium, and porphyromonas and the related streptococcus salivarius and genera sphingomonas and treponema: since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. however, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.

TI  == [investigate of nasopharyngeal flora in highly aged patients].
AB  == to clarify the bacteriological interpretation of flora in the nasopharynx of highly aged patients (n = 107), healthy nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from subjects of advanced age. chief pathogenic bacteria isolated from highly aged persons were coagulase negative staphylococcus (43 strains), corynebacterium spp. (14 strains), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase production and non-production) (16 strains), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase production) (6 strains). chief nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from highly aged persons were alpha-streptococcus (14 strains), neisseria sp (3 strains). streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis which are the chief bacteria isolated from children, demonstrated only 3 strains for each bacteria. in cases showing detection of multiple detected bacteria, common combinations were non-pathogenic bacteria and  weakly pathogenic bacteria and enteric bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. the differences between nasopharyngeal flora of children and highly aged persons are  suspected to be due to the differences in immunological and anatomical factors. we should actively examine these factors in highly aged subjects.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == microbiology of the middle meatus: a comparison between normal adults and children.
AB  == middle meatal samples were obtained from 52 carefully selected healthy adults. in 75 per cent of the test subjects bacterial organisms were cultured. however, growth was often poor and the predominant species suggest a commensal flora: coagulase-negative staphylococci were retrieved from 35 per cent, corynebacterium sp. from 23 per cent and staphyloccus aureus from eight per cent of the adults. these data are very different from those previously obtained among children where--even in the absence of obvious ent pathology--the most frequently cultured organisms were typical sinusitis pathogens: haemophilus influenzae present in 40  per cent, moraxella catarrhalis in 34 per cent and streptococcus pneumoniae in 50 per cent of children. furthermore, streptococcus viridans and neisseria sp., both organisms that might be able to inhibit colonization by some of the pathogens and found commonly among children, are virtually absent in healthy adults.

TI  == designing meningitis vaccines.
AB  == conjugate polysaccharide vaccines are a recent intervention to combat the relative inability of young children to mount an effective immune response against encapsulated bacteria, especially haemophilus influenzae (hib), neisseria meningitidis (nm) and streptococcus pneumoniae (sp). these organisms cause the majority of community acquired septicaemia and meningitis in uk children. their capsular polysaccharides, important virulence factors in evading phagocytosis, are poorly immunogenic in young children compared to adults. conjugation, by covalent linking, of the polysaccharide to an immunogenic protein, has been demonstrated for each of these organisms to produce good antibody response to the polysaccharide. conjugate hib vaccines have proven effective in reducing hib meningitis and invasive disease in the countries that have introduced them. pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have proven effective in preventing invasive disease caused by serotypes contained in the vaccines. efficacy studies are awaited for meningococcal conjugate vaccines.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

AB  == bronchopulmonary infection affects the prognosis of lung cancer patients. thus, we investigated the relationship between the prognosis of bronchopulmonary infectious diseases and their causative bacteria isolated by transtracheal aspiration (tta) in lung cancer patients. in the present study, we determined which factor is more predisposing for the outcome of bronchopulmonary infections, the type of causative bacteria or the host nutritional status. a total of 107 lung cancer patients, which consisted of 105 males and 5 females (mean age 67.3 +/- 8.0), were included in this study. the study was conducted from 1981 to 1994. they were classified into the survival group and the deceased group. causative agents of infection were compared between these 2 groups. s. pneumoniae, alpha-streptococcus sp., m. catarrhalis, and neisseria sp. were predominant in organisms isolated from tta-specimens of lung cancer patients with bronchopulmonary infections, regardless of prognosis. nutritional status, as determined by serum levels of cholinesterase, albumin, and cholesterol, was poor  in the deceased group than in the survival group. these results indicate that the outcome of bronchopulmonary infections in lung cancer patients are affected mainly by the nutritional status of the host.

TI  == microbiologic, radiographic, and anatomic study of the nasolacrimal duct apparatus in the rabbit (oryctolagus cuniculus).
AB  == this study was motivated by the sporadic observation of epiphora in two male rabbits. the epiphora was unilateral and not associated with conjunctivitis or pasteurella infection. to characterize the cause of epiphora, we studied 15 specific-pathogen-free new zealand white rabbits. this study group was composed of the two affected males, four unaffected males, and nine unaffected females. clinical evaluation consisted of bacterial culture of conjunctival specimens, examination of conjunctival scrapings for chlamydial inclusions, culture and cytologic examination of specimens from the nasolacrimal duct, plain and contrast radiography, latex casting, histologic examination, and the schirmer tear test. important differences found in the rabbits with epiphora included an opalescent,  gritty, nasolacrimal duct flush fluid and marked unilateral dilatation of the duct proximal to a dorsal flexure at the caudal limit of the incisor tooth root.  the flush solution from one affected rabbit cleared with ether, suggesting the presence of triglycerides or cholesterol. the organisms most commonly isolated from the conjunctiva were moraxella sp., oligella urethralis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp., and streptococcus viridans. the organisms most commonly isolated from the nasolacrimal duct flush fluid were moraxella sp., s. viridans, and neisseria sp. culture of the nasolacrimal duct flush fluid yielded microorganisms more consistently than did culture of the conjunctival specimens. all microorganisms isolated from affected rabbits also were isolated from unaffected rabbits. there was no apparent contribution of microorganisms to the development of epiphora, and schirmer tear test results for affected animals were within the range seen in unaffected animals. occlusion of the nasolacrimal duct was presumed to be attributable to fat droplets. this study augments the existing literature and represents the first report of anomalous nasolacrimal duct anatomic features in the rabbit.

TI  == microbial flora of the subglottis in intubated pediatric patients.
AB  == infection of the intubated subglottis is felt to be one of the many factors involved in the pathogenesis of acquired cicatricial subglottic stenosis. the precise role of infection is unclear and the microbial flora has not been established. an analysis of subglottic culture material, from 22 intubated pediatric patients undergoing tracheotomy, has been performed to establish the nature of the subglottic microbial flora. fifty-nine isolates were found, including 19 types of organisms. the number of isolates per patient ranged from one to eight, with an average of 2.7 isolates per patient. the most common isolates in the 22 patients were alpha-hemolytic streptococcus viridans (17 isolates-77%), neisseria sp. (6 isolates-27%), pseudomonas sp. (5 isolates-22%),  and coagulase negative staphylococcus sp. (5 isolates-22%). this data indicates that colonization of the subglottis in intubated pediatric patients is polymicrobial in nature. alpha-hemolytic streptococcus viridans and neisseria sp. were most common, with a shift in cultured flora towards pseudomonas sp. in patients intubated for more than 10 days. in view of this, antimicrobial therapy  may be of benefit in preventing acquired cicatricial subglottic stenosis.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of quinolones.
AB  == the quinolones are new antimicrobial agents that are descendants of nalidixic acid. as a new class of synthetic antimicrobials they exhibit a wide spectrum of  activity. newer quinolones such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, and pefloxacin are highly active against gram negative bacilli of the enterobacteriaceae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus ducreyi. they exhibit less activity against pseudomonas sp. and staphylococcus sp., and little in vitro activity against streptococcus pneumoniae or enterococci. their activity against mycobacterium sp. is variable, and obligate anaerobes are usually considered resistant. of the quinolones reviewed, ciprofloxacin displays the highest degree of in vitro activity.

AB  == deep tonsillar flora were identified in tonsils removed from 48 patients, children and adults, with chronic tonsillitis and recurrent sore throats or obstructive hypertrophy. most specimens (38/48) cultured multiple germs (2 to 5 different species) with aerobic and anaerobic gram+ and gram-forms, some being beta-lactamase producers. of the total of 135 strains isolated, 104 were aerobic  and 31 anaerobic. the species of aerobic germs most frequently isolated were: apart from alpha-hemolytic streptococci of undertermined group (38 strains), haemophilus sp. : 14 (including 3 beta-lactamase + strains), staphylococcus aureus: 15 (including 11 beta-lactamase + strains), streptococcus a : 10, enterobacteriaceae : 6, neisseria sp. : 8 (including 1 beta-lactamase + strain).  and among the anaerobic germs: peptococcus : 3, veillonella alc : 10, fusobacterium nucleatum : 9, bacteroides melaninogenicus : 6, other bacteroides : 2. of the 127 strains tested, 102 were sensitive to amoxicillin and 121 to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combination. the presence of a beta-lactamase producing bacterium in 1 of 3 specimens suggests the risk of failure of treatment with penicillin, prescribed classically for this type of affection.

AB  == 36 cerebrospinal fluid specimens (csf) from patients with bacterial meningitis were tested for the presence of bacterial antigens with the "slidex meningite kit" (bio merieux). this kit has latex particles coated with antibodies against hemophilus influenzae type b (hib) streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) and neisseria meningitidis (nm) group a and c. with the lat we could detect the bacterial antigens in 84% of bacterial meningitis cases, 23 of the 27 of hib meningitis (85.2%), all of the 6 cases of sp meningitis (100%) and two of the three nm meningitis cases. the test is handicapped by the fact, that there is no antiserum against nm sero-group b, the main cause of nm meningitis in austria. there were no false positive results with the lat. false negative results were obtained in 19.2% of hib and in one case of nm. even under sufficient antibiotic therapy and  with negative culture we could detect 9 hib- and 1 nm-cases during the first 12-48 hours of therapy with this method. the lat-kit is a useful addition to standard methods of csf examinations in bacterial meningitis. with the lat a rapid bacteriological diagnosis is possible within 15 minutes. the kit is also able to identify bacterial antigens even with negative culture and after initiation of antibiotic treatment.

AB  == two simple and low-priced kits to detect bacterial antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens from patients with suspected meningitis have recently become available. methods employed by these kits are staphylococcal coagglutination (coa) and latex agglutination (la). the coa "phadebact csf-kit" (pharmacia) detects haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), neisseria meningitidis (nm) groups a, b, c, y and w 135 and streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), whereas the la "slidex meningite-kit" (biomerieux) includes hib, nm a, nm c and sp. these two diagnostic tests were compared with the standard methods for analyzing csf specimens from children with suspected meningitis. a total of 336 csf specimens were tested. forty-three were from children with bacterial meningitis due to hib, nm or sp obtained before antimicrobial therapy. thirty-four of them (79%) were correctly detected by coa, 23 (54%) by la, and 42 (97%) by microscopic analysis of stained smears. there were 65 csf samples of such meningitis cases obtained after initiation of antimicrobial therapy: coa detected 26 (40%), la 17 (26%) and staining 26 (40%). with culture-positive csf specimens from patients before therapy, the best sensitivities were obtained with la for sp (100%) and coa for hib (87%), whereas the results for nm antigen detection were only 43% with coa and 0% with la (no reagent against nm b). cross-reactions with other bacterial antigens were frequent with coa (26%) and rare with la (2%), resulting in false-positive findings in 6 of the 66 positive tests with coa (9%) but in none of the 40 positive tests with la (0%). one of the 48 specimens from aseptic meningitis cases was false-positive for hib by coa, whereas all 172 normal specimens were negative with both methods. with 5 culture-negative csf specimens  from patients with unequivocal purulent meningitis coa detected bacterial antigen in 5 and la in 2. conclusions: the two kits evaluated cannot replace standard methods for analyzing csf specimens, in view of insufficient sensitivity (mainly  la) or frequent cross-reactions and false-positive values (coa). however, due to  their simplicity, rapidity, and possible identification of bacterial pathogens after initiation of antimicrobial therapy, these kits are recommended as an useful addition to standard methods.

AB  == lymphocyte from 12 intrinsic asthmatic patients and 10 healthy controls were studied for their capability to produce histamine releasing factor (hrf) in vitro. spontaneous hrf production was measured by culturing the lymphocytes alone for 20 h. in another set of experiments lymphocytes were first preincubated separately with phytohaemagglutinin, antigens of haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus viridans, staphylococcus sp. and neisseria catarrhalis for 4 h then carefully washed three times and cultured alone for an additional 16 h. cell-free supernatant was assayed for histamine releasing activity using basophils from healthy donors. it was observed that lymphocytes from intrinsic asthmatic patients spontaneously produced hrf. the production of this lymphokine was enhanced following preincubation of lymphocytes with phytohaemagglutinin or bacterial antigens. results of skin test with bacterial antigens did not correlate with the magnitude of the production of hrf by lymphocytes. at gel chromatography over sephadex g-75 bacterial antigen-stimulated lymphocyte supernatant revealed two peaks of hrf activity in the molecular weight ranges 35,000-50,000 and 3,000-7,000.

AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == the association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  == sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured  higher levels of neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high streptococcus sanguis levels and total gram-positive cocci and fewer  gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of streptococcus salivarius and veillonella sp. sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; strep. mutans,  veillonella sp. and lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. sucrose intake was negatively related to  concentrations of neisseria sp. on the tongue and total gram-positive bacilli in  saliva. a definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. the high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the  generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.

TI  == [rhino- and oropharyngeal carriage of haemophilus sp. in children].
AB  == the occurence of haemophilus sp. and other potential pathogens: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and neisseria meningitidis has been investigated in 79 children from rhino and oropharyngeal material. h. parainfluenzae is only isolated from the oropharynx. h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae may be isolated from the rhinopharynx but are associated to signs of infection in the upper respiratory tract. the capsule of h. influenzae represents a colonization factor of the rhinopharynx from an oropharyngeal carriage. 6.1% of h. influenzae and 28% of h. parainfluenzae isolates were found resistant to penicillin by production of betalactamase.

TI  == an evaluation of latex particle agglutination to detect antigenemia in children.
AB  == latex particle agglutination (lpa) was used to detect specific bacterial capsular antigen in sera collected at the time blood samples were taken from children with suspected bacteremia. capsular polysaccharide antigens tested for were haemophilus influenzae type b (hi b), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), streptococcus agalactiae (sa) and neisseria meningitidis (nm) groups a and c. an  adequate volume of serum was available for 1085 of the blood culture sets received. antigenemia was detected in 47 children; 36 children from whom the homologous microorganism was isolated from the associated blood culture and 11 children who had prior antibiotic therapy and whose blood culture grew no microorganism. antigenemia was not detected in 46 children whose blood culture yielded a bacterium for which a homologous lpa reagent was available. fifty children had positive blood cultures with microorganisms considered significant to which no lpa reagent was available. lpa was of value as a rapid diagnostic test in the identification of the etiological agent in severe infectious disease  in children.

TI  == the bacteriology and cytology of chronic otitis media with effusion.
AB  == the bacteriology and cytology of middle ear effusion from 729 children with persistent otitis media with effusion were studied. thirty-five percent of these  chronic effusions were culture-positive. type b and non-type b haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria sp. and staphylococcus epidermidis were the predominant isolates. serous and mucoid effusion cultures yielded bacteria more often in younger than in older children. in addition bacteria were seen in 17% of the gram-stained smears of the sterile effusions; gram-positive cocci predominated in these effusions. disparate effusion culture results were obtained in 32% of bilateral otitis media cases. effusions which yielded h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae on culture had more polymorphonuclear leukocytes than did effusions which yielded s. epidermidis or neisseria or were sterile. phagocytic cells were equally prevalent in sterile effusions with or without bacteria on gram stain. phagocytic cells were seen less often in mucoid effusions from antibiotic-treated patients than in mucoid effusions from untreated patients. the results suggest that certain bacteria in chronic middle ear effusion contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition by eliciting a local inflammatory cell response.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  == studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. mic of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of staphylococcus  aureus (36 strains), escherichia coli (35 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). mic of cefoxitin against s. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. many strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae that showed high mic to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. it is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. mic of cefoxitin against h. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. the serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. the mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. the mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours  after the injection. 3. in order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. as for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. as for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of h. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-streptococcus, enterococcus, e. coli and neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. no side effect was observed in any case. abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each  of reduction of rbc and hb, elevation of got and gpt and elevation of gpt, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.

TI  == microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in zaria, nigeria.
AB  == nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in zaria have been identified. the work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. the isolates in order of prevalence were: candida albicans (20.9%), klebsiella sp (15.0%), escherichia coli (9.1%), streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), streptococcus viridans (2.1%), staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), proteus mirabilis (1.1%), peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp were sought but not found. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. it appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. for this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.

TI  == oropharyngeal cultures of patients in protected environment units: evaluation of  semiquantitative technique during antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  == a semiquantitative culture technique was used to monitor the microbial flora of the oropharynx of 30 patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis in protected environment units. after institution of antibiotic prophylaxis, the median concentration of organisms in the oropharynx fell by 2 logs but gradually increased by 1 log and then remained stable. neisseria spp., micrococcus sp., and streptococci were generally eradicated by the antibiotics but were replaced by lactobacilli and yeast. four of nine enteric organisms persisted despite in vitro sensitivity to the antibiotic regimens. yeast were cultured from the initial specimens of only 17% of the 30 patients, but they were cultured subsequently from specimens of 80% of the 20 patients who remained in protected environment units for at least 8 weeks.
