TI  == clostridium aldenense sp. nov. and clostridium citroniae sp. nov. isolated from human clinical infections.
AB  == one hundred eight isolates were previously identified in our laboratory as clostridium clostridioforme by colonial and cellular morphology, as well as biochemical tests. recent studies have indicated that there are actually three different species in this c. clostridioforme group: c. hathewayi, c. bolteae, and c. clostridioforme. our isolates were reexamined using biochemical and enzymatic  tests and molecular methods. forty-six isolates were reidentified as c. hathewayi, 34 as c. bolteae, five as c. clostridioforme, and one as c. symbiosum. twenty-two strains were identified only to the genus level by 16s rrna gene sequencing, and although they are microscopically and morphologically indistinguishable from the above-mentioned three species, they are phenotypically different and only 96 to 98% similar by gene sequencing. twenty of these 22 strains were indole positive and formed two novel species. we propose clostridium aldenense sp. nov. and clostridium citroniae sp. nov. as names for these new species. they are differentiated from each other by results for raffinose, rhamnose, alpha-galactosidase, and beta-galactosidase: positive, negative, positive, and positive, respectively, for the former species and negative, positive, negative, and negative, respectively, for the latter species. the type  strain of c. aldenense is rma 9741 (atcc baa-1318; ccug 52204), and the type strain of c. citroniae is rma 16102 (atcc baa-1317; ccug 52203).

TI  == nadp+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase in the antarctic psychrotolerant bacterium psychrobacter sp. tad1. characterization, protein and dna sequence, and relationship to other glutamate dehydrogenases.
AB  == the antarctic psychrotolerant bacterium psychrobacter sp. tad1 contains two distinct glutamate dehydrogenases (gdh), each specific for either nadp+ or nad+.  this feature is quite unusual in bacteria, which generally have a single gdh. nadp+-dependent gdh has been purified to homogeneity and the gene encoding gdh has been cloned and expressed. the enzyme has a hexameric structure. the amino acid sequence determined by peptide and gene analyses comprises 447 residues, yielding a protein with a molecular mass of 49 285 da. the sequence shows homology with hexameric gdhs, with identity levels of 52% and 49% with escherichia coli and clostridium symbiosum gdh, respectively. the coenzyme-binding fingerprint motif gxgxxg/a (common to all gdhs) has ser at the last position in this enzyme. the overall hydrophilic character is increased and  a five-residue insertion in a loop between two alpha-helices may contribute to the increase in protein flexibility. psychrobacter sp. tad1 gdh apparent temperature optimum is shifted towards low temperatures, whereas irreversible heat inactivation occurs at temperatures similar to those of e. coli gdh. the catalytic efficiency in the temperature range 10-30 degrees c is similar or lower than that of e. coli gdh. unlike e. coli gdh the enzyme exhibits marked positive  cooperativity towards 2-oxoglutarate and nadph. this feature is generally absent  in prokaryotic gdhs. these observations suggest a regulatory role for this gdh, the most crucial feature being the structural/functional properties required for  fine regulation of activity, rather than the high catalytic efficiency and thermolability encountered in several cold-active enzymes.
