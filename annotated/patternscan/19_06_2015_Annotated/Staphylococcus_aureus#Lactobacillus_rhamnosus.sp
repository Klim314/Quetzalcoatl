TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == probiotic features of lactobacillus strains isolated from ragusano and pecorino siciliano cheeses.
AB  == in the present study 177 lactobacillus spp. strains, isolated from ragusano and pecorino siciliano cheeses, were in vitro screened for probiotic traits, and their characteristics were compared to those of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, commercial strain. based on acidic and bile salt resistance, thirteen lactobacillus strains were selected. the multiplex-pcr application revealed that  nine strains belonged to l. rhamnosus species and four to lactobacillus paracasei species. all selected strains were further investigated for transit tolerance in  simulated upper gastrointestinal tract (gi), for adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines, for hydrophobicity, for co-aggregation and auto-aggregation and for antimicrobial activities. moreover, antibiotic resistance, hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities were investigated for safety assessment. viable counts after simulated gastric and duodenal transit revealed that overall the selected lactobacilli tolerated better pancreatic juice and bile salts than acidic juice. in particular, three l. rhamnosus strains (fs10, fs2, and ps11) and one l. paracasei strain (pm8) increased their cell density after the simulated gi transit. the same strains showed also high percentage of auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with escherichia coli. all strains were effective against both staphylococcus aureus and e. coli and variability was achieved versus listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis  used as pathogenic indicator strains. different behavior was revealed by strains  for adhesion ability and hydrophobicity, which are not always linked each other and are strongly strain-dependent. from the safety point of view, no isolate showed hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities, except one, and most of the  strains were sensitive to a broad range of clinical antibiotics. this work showed that the l. rhamnosus fs10 and the l. paracasei pm8 are good promising probiotic  candidates for further in vivo investigations.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus isolated from dairy samples for probiotic properties.
AB  == in the present study twelve lactobacillus isolates (lbs 1-lbs 12) were characterized for probiotic properties. out of the twelve, eight isolates (lbs 1-6, 8 and 11) were bile resistant (survival > 50% at 0.3% bile salt w/v) and five isolates (lbs 1, 2, 5, 6 and 11) were found acid ph value resistant (survival > 50% at ph 3). all twelve isolates inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus whereas isolate lbs 2 also inhibited the growth of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. antibiotic susceptibility testing of isolates was also performed and isolate lbs 2 was selected for further study based on its broad spectrum effect in clinical pathogen inhibition. lbs 2 was characterized phenotypically at institute of microbial technology (imtech), chandigarh, india and was confirmed as lactobacillus rhamnosus by 16s rdna sequencing and subsequent analysis using blast. the gene sequence was deposited in genbank with accession number kj562858. scanning electron microscopy (sem) study was used to study in vitro epithelial cell adherence and bile salt effect on isolate lbs 2. epithelial cells adherence assay showed positive results and surface roughness of lbs 2 increased with increase in bile salt (0.15-0.45% w/v).

TI  == tolerability of a probiotic in subjects with a history of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus colonisation.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a pathogen of major public  health importance. colonisation precedes infection; thus reducing mrsa carriage may be of benefit for reducing infection. probiotics represent a novel approach to reducing mrsa carriage. we undertook a pilot feasibility randomised controlled trial of the tolerability and acceptability of probiotics for reducing nasal and  intestinal carriage of mrsa. in addition, subjects were screened for vancomycin-resistant enterocococci (vre). subjects with a history of mrsa were recruited from a large, academic medical center and randomised to take either a placebo or probiotic (lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001). subjects returned to the clinic after four weeks for further testing to determine adherence to the probiotic regimen and colonisation of mrsa. 48 subjects were enrolled and randomised. nearly 25% were transplant recipients and 30% had diabetes. the probiotic was well tolerated in the study population though minor side effects, such as nausea and bloating, were observed. a majority of the subjects randomised to hn001 had good adherence to the regimen. at the four week time point among subjects randomised to the probiotic, mrsa was detected in 67 and 50% of subjects colonised in the nares and the gastrointestinal tract, respectively. three subjects who initially tested positive for vre were negative after four weeks of  probiotic exposure. probiotics were well tolerated in our study population of largely immunocompromised subjects with multiple comorbidities. adherence to the  intervention was good. probiotics should be studied further for their potential to reduce colonisation by multidrug resistant bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of biosurfactants isolated from lactobacilli against multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == background: biosurfactants (bs) are amphiphilic compounds produced by microbes, either on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly. bs exhibit strong antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties, making them good candidates for applications used to combat infections. in this study, our goal was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities of bs produced by lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus rhamnosus against clinical multidrug  resistant (mdr) strains of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). cell-bound bs from both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus were extracted and isolated. the surface activities of crude bs samples were evaluated using an oil spreading assay. the antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities of both bs against the above mentioned mdr pathogens were determined. results: surface activities for both bs ranged from 6.25 to 25 mg/ml  with clear zones observed between 7 and 11 cm. bs of both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus showed antimicrobial activities against a. baumannii, e. coli and s. aureus at 25-50 mg/ml. anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities were also observed for the aforementioned pathogens between 25 and 50 mg/ml. finally, analysis by electron microscope indicated that the bs caused membrane damage for  a. baumannii and pronounced cell wall damage in s. aureus. conclusion: our results indicate that bs isolated from two lactobacilli strains has antibacterial properties against mdr strains of a. baumannii, e. coli and mrsa. both bs also displayed anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities against a. baumannii, e. coli  and s. aureus. together, these capabilities may open up possibilities for bs as an alternative therapeutic approach for the prevention and/or treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg inhibits the toxic effects of staphylococcus aureus on epidermal keratinocytes.
AB  == few studies have evaluated the potential benefits of the topical application of probiotic bacteria or material derived from them. we have investigated whether a  probiotic bacterium, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, can inhibit staphylococcus aureus infection of human primary keratinocytes in culture. when primary human keratinocytes were exposed to s. aureus, only 25% of the keratinocytes remained viable following 24 h of incubation. however, in the presence of 10(8) cfu/ml of  live l. rhamnosus gg, the viability of the infected keratinocytes increased to 57% (p = 0.01). l. rhamnosus gg lysates and spent culture fluid also provided significant protection to keratinocytes, with 65% (p = 0.006) and 57% (p = 0.01)  of cells, respectively, being viable following 24 h of incubation. keratinocyte survival was significantly enhanced regardless of whether the probiotic was applied in the viable form or as cell lysates 2 h before or simultaneously with (p = 0.005) or 12 h after (p = 0.01) s. aureus infection. however, spent culture  fluid was protective only if added before or simultaneously with s. aureus. with  respect to mechanism, both l. rhamnosus gg lysate and spent culture fluid apparently inhibited adherence of s. aureus to keratinocytes by competitive exclusion, but only viable bacteria or the lysate could displace s. aureus (p = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). furthermore, growth of s. aureus was inhibited by either live bacteria or lysate but not spent culture fluid. together, these data  suggest at least two separate activities involved in the protective effects of l. rhamnosus gg against s. aureus, growth inhibition and reduction of bacterial adhesion.

TI  == assessment of synergistic combination potential of probiotic and bacteriophage against antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus aureus exposed to simulated intestinal conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the combined effect of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus and bacteriophage sa11 on the control of antibiotic-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (assa) and antibiotic-resistant s. aureus (arsa) under the simulated intestinal conditions. the survivability of assa and arsa were determined in the simulated phosphate-buffered saline (pbs)-,  trypticase soy broth (tsb)-, and milk-based gastric juices adjusted to ph 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 at 37 degrees c for 30 min. the inhibitory effect of bacteriophage sa11 and probiotic on the growth of assa and arsa was evaluated in the simulated  intestinal juices at 37 degrees c for 20 h. the least reductions in the numbers of assa and arsa were observed in the milk-based gastric juices at ph 2.0 (<1 log). no significant changes in the teichoic acid-mediated sliding motility were  observed for assa and arsa after 30-min exposure to the simulated gastric juices  (ph 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0), responsible for the enhanced bacterial attachment to the  epithelial cells. the bacteriophage sa11 was stable down to ph 5.0 and up to 0.06 % bile salts. the bacteriophage sa11 combined with probiotic effectively inhibited the growth of assa and arsa in the simulated intestinal conditions, showing more than 4 log reduction. the relative expression levels of adhesion-related genes (clfa, eno, and fnba) and efflux-related genes (mdea, norb, and norc) were less decreased in arsa than in assa after exposure to the simulated gastrointestinal conditions. these results might shed light on the application of bacteriophage to control the ingested antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens in the intestinal tract.

TI  == effectiveness of alternative methods for toothbrush disinfection: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative methods  for toothbrush disinfection. methods: two-hundred eighty toothbrushes were included in the study. the toothbrushes were divided into 7 groups and were contaminated by standardized suspensions of lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus), streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus),  and escherichia coli (e. coli). the following disinfectants were tested: 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), 100% and 50% white vinegar, microwave (mw) oven, ultraviolet (uv) sanitizer, and mouth rinse-containing propolis (mcp). data were  analyzed with kruskal wallis and dunn's tests. results: statistically significant differences were found between different methods and control group for all tested bacteria. there were statistically significant differences between all test groups for all microorganisms. mw was the most effective for l. rhamnosus and 100% white vinegar was the most effective method for s. mutans and s. aureus. naocl was the most effective for e. coli. conclusion: this study showed that 100% white vinegar was considered to be effective for tested microorganisms. similarly, 1% naocl is cost-effective, easily accessible, and comparatively effective for toothbrush disinfection. because these agents are nontoxic, cost-effective and easily accessible, they may be appropriate for household use.

TI  == effect of two probiotic strains of lactobacillus on in vitro adherence of listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == the lactobacilli probiotics maintain a normal vaginal biota and prevent disease recurrence. this microorganisms form a pellicle on the vaginal epithelium that acts as a biologic barrier against colonization by pathogenic bacteria. in this paper were realized assays of exclusion, competition, and displacement. for these test, vaginal epithelial cells, two strains of lactobacilli and pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes) were used. the lactobacilli strains showed a great capacity of adherence, with a mean of 83.5 +/- 26.67 lactobacillus fermentum cells and 56.2 +/- 20.87 lactobacillus rhamnosus cells per vaginal epithelial cells. l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus were able to reduce the adherence of s. aureus, s. agalactiae and l. monocytogenes in a significant level in this assay (p < 0.01).  the lactobacilli used in this study protect the vaginal epithelium through a series of barriers and interference mechanisms. the aim of present study was to assess the ability of vaginal lactobacillus strains, selected for their probiotic properties, to block the adherence of pathogenic microorganisms in vitro by displacement, competition, and exclusion mechanisms.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.
AB  == neutrophil extracellular traps (nets) are an essential component of the antimicrobial repertoire and represent an effective means by which neutrophils capture, contain, and kill microorganisms. however, the uncontrolled or excessive liberation of nets also damages surrounding cells and can contribute to disease pathophysiology. alterations in the gut microbiota, as well as the presence of local and systemic markers of inflammation, are strongly associated with the manifestation of a spectrum of intestinal disorders, including chronic inflammatory bowel disease. although probiotics exert beneficial effects on gut homeostasis, their direct effect on neutrophils, which are abundant in the setting of intestinal inflammation, remains unclear. in this study, we investigated the effects of nonpathogenic, enteropathogenic, and probiotic bacteria on the dynamics of net formation. using murine bone marrow-derived neutrophils and the neutrophil-differentiated human myeloid cell line d.hl-60, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg inhibits both pma- and staphylococcus aureus-induced formation of nets. moreover, probiotic l. rhamnosus strain gg had potent antioxidative activity: dampening reactive oxygen species production and phagocytic capacity of the neutrophils while protecting against cell cytotoxicity. within the milieu of the gut, this represents a novel mechanism by  which probiotics can locally dampen innate immune responses and confer desensitization toward luminal ags.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == strain-specific probiotics properties of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis isolates from brazilian food products.
AB  == a total of 234 lab isolates from brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at ph 2.0. fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. they were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-pcr and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (10) and lactobacillus brevis (7). based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one l. fermentum (ch58), three l. plantarum (ch3,  ch41 and sau96) and two l. brevis (sau105 and ffc199) were selected. the highest  co-aggregation ability with escherichia coli was observed to l. plantarum ch41. l. brevis sau105 and ffc199 and l. fermentum ch58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 and l. brevis ffc199 showed adhesion ability to caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (1.5%). they were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) of caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). the present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the  isolates l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 (cocoa) and l. brevis ffc199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri protects epidermal keratinocytes from staphylococcus aureus-induced cell death by competitive exclusion.
AB  == recent studies have suggested that the topical application of probiotic bacteria  can improve skin health or combat disease. we have utilized a primary human keratinocyte culture model to investigate whether probiotic bacteria can inhibit  staphylococcus aureus infection. evaluation of the candidate probiotics lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730, lactobacillus rhamnosus ac413, and lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 demonstrated that both l. reuteri and l. rhamnosus, but not l. salivarius, reduced s. aureus-induced keratinocyte cell death in both undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes. keratinocyte survival was significantly higher if the probiotic was applied prior to (p < 0.01) or simultaneously with (p < 0.01) infection with s. aureus but not when added after infection had commenced (p > 0.05). the protective effect of l. reuteri was not dependent on the elaboration of inhibitory substances such as lactic acid. l. reuteri inhibited adherence of s. aureus to keratinocytes by competitive exclusion (p = 0.026). l. salivarius ucc118, however, did not inhibit s. aureus from adhering to keratinocytes (p > 0.05) and did not protect keratinocyte viability. s. aureus utilizes the alpha5beta1 integrin to adhere to  keratinocytes, and blocking of this integrin resulted in a protective effect similar to that observed with probiotics (p = 0.03). this suggests that the protective mechanism for l. reuteri-mediated protection of keratinocytes was by competitive exclusion of the pathogen from its binding sites on the cells. our results suggest that use of a topical probiotic prophylactically could inhibit the colonization of skin by s. aureus and thus aid in the prevention of infection.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == the fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna and cdna. furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on  survival of added escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr. a high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. bacteria belonging to the genera brevibacterium, staphylococcus, escherichia, weissella, leuconostoc, pediococcus were also detected in both 16s rdna and cdna obtained from raw milk and cheeses. e. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both dna and rna extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. growth of e. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification  but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of  raw milk. growth of l. innocua and s. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all  cheeses at different stages of ripening. the use of 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing  and qrt-pcr allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.

AB  == bacteria play a significant role in water contamination. chemicals are mostly used for the treatment of bacteriologically contaminated water. the use of bacterial interactions is a new approach to limit the pathogens' growth. detection of antimicrobial substances produced by lactic acid bacteria against the waterborne pathogens is the objective of this work. microbiological and biochemical methods were used to identify lactic acid bacteria having an antimicrobial activity. evaluation of antimicrobial activity with growth kinetic  measurements was performed. four isolates of lactic acid bacteria obtained from whey and curd were identified. the predominant species belonging to the lactobacillus genera are: lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus paracasei, and lactobacillus paraplantarum. the present study revealed that the lactobacillus consortium is able to inhibit staphylococcus aureus's growth along with escherichia coli and vibrio species. in mixed culture, after 24 h, the lactobacillus consortium reduces the growth of s. aureus by 2.03  log; moreover, the growth of the latter bacteria totally ceased after 72 h of incubation. the protein produced by the lactobacillus consortium was responsible  for arresting the growth of s. aureus.

TI  == peptidoglycan recognition protein 3 (pglyrp3) has an anti-inflammatory role in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == intestinal epithelial cells produce cytokines in response to bacterial peptidoglycan (pgn), which is detected by several classes of pattern-recognition  receptors (prrs) as peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pglyrps), toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) and nod receptors. all types of pglyrps recognize bacterial peptidoglycan and function in antibacterial innate immunity. in this study, we investigated the role of pglyrp3 in the response of intestinal epithelial cells (caco-2) to pgn from pathogenic (staphylococcus aureus), opportunistic pathogenic (micrococcus luteus) and non-pathogenic (bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg) bacteria found in the gut as commensals or in gastroenteritis. all  pgns induced the proinflammatory cytokines il-12p35, il-8 and tnf-alpha and, time-dependently, pglyrp3, at both the transcription and protein levels. in this  context, no differences were observed among the distinct pgn obtained from different bacterial sources. the inflammatory response to pgn is mediated via the tlr2 pathway, since blocking this pathway by inhibiting myd88 reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. in addition, pglyrp3 overexpression suppressed, while pglyrp3 knocking down enhanced the expression of pgn-induced inflammatory cytokines. it is concluded that pgn stimulates inflammatory responses in the intestinal epithelia through activation of the tlr pathway. pglyrp3 is also stimulated by pgn and has, in contrast to activation of the tlr pathway, an anti-inflammatory effect.

TI  == bacterial dna from orthopedic implants after routine removal.
AB  == bacterial 16s rdna was monitored and identified from orthopedic metallic implants after routine or septic removal from patients in a german hospital. from march to june 2009, 28 metallic implants, 10 human biopsies, and 6 foam dressings from 28  patients were investigated. after analysis of this first collective, the methods  were optimized to enhance sensitivity and to reduce interference with human dna.  then a second collective consisting of 21 metallic implants from 21 patients was  investigated from june 2009 to january 2010. in the first collective, 71% of the  metallic implants were negative for eubacterial dna. pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and opportunists such as lactobacillus rhamnosus were identified in 11% of the samples, whereas the residual 18% positive results were  classified as from skin sources or could not be confirmed. tissue, secretion, and bone samples as well as foam dressings from the same collective also contained pathogens and opportunists. after the optimization of the methods, a considerable increase of positive samples was seen: in the second collective 19 of the 21 metallic implants proved to be positive for eubacterial 16s rdna. bacterial dna from environmental sources was detected in 13 samples, and in 20 specimens, predominantly mostly the skin. opportunistic pathogens were detected in 19 samples. interestingly, septic complications did not occur despite the presence of bacterial dna. the results obtained up to now encourage us not only to continue a directed monitoring of bacterial dna on orthopedic implants in practice but also to look intensely for possible sources of bacterial contamination during and after insertion or during removal of such implants.

TI  == use of rosemary, oregano, and a commercial blend of essential oils in broiler chickens: in vitro antimicrobial activities and effects on growth performance.
AB  == the present study was conducted to characterize the in vitro antimicrobial activities of 3 essential oils [oregano, rosemary, and a commercial blend of essential oils (beo)] against pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria and to evaluate their effects on broiler chicken performances. the chemical composition  of the essential oils was determined using the gas chromatography interfaced with a mass spectroscopy. the disc diffusion method, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were applied for the determination of antimicrobial activities of essential oils. in vivo study, a total of seven hundred fifty 1-d-old male broiler chickens were assigned to 6 dietary treatment groups: basal diet (control; con), con + 44 mg of avilamycin/kg (a), con + 100 mg of rosemary essential oil/kg (ros), con + 100 mg  of oregano essential oil/kg (or), con + 50 mg of rosemary and 50 mg of oregano essential oils/kg (ro), and con + 1,000 mg of beo/kg (essential oil mixture, eom). the essential oils isolated from rosemary and oregano were characterized by their greater content of 1,8-cineole (49.99%) and carvacrol (69.55%), respectively. the beo was mainly represented by the aldehyde (cinnamaldehyde) and the monoterpene (1,8-cineole) chemical groups. the results of the disc diffusion  method indicated that the rosemary essential oil had antibacterial activity (p </= 0.05) against only 3 pathogenic bacteria, escherichia coli (8 mm), salmonella indiana (11 mm), and listeria innocua (9 mm). the essential oil of oregano had antimicrobial activities (p </= 0.05) on the same bacteria as rosemary but also on staphylococcus aureus (22 mm) and bacillus subtilis (12 mm). oregano essential oil had greater (p </= 0.05) antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria than rosemary essential oil but they had no synergism between them. the beo showed an increased antimicrobial activity (p </= 0.05) against all studied bacteria (pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria) except for lactobacillus rhamnosus. the supplementation of the basal diet with avilamycin or essential oils improved (p </= 0.05) broiler chicken bw, bw gain, and g:f compared with the con diet. there were no differences in growth performances among birds fed a, ros, or, ro, or eom diets. in general, essential oils contained in rosemary, oregano, and beo can substitute for growth promoter antibiotics. although the 3 essential oils had different antimicrobial activities, they exhibited the same efficiency in broiler chickens.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice.
AB  == peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. the digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (ph 2.5) and human duodenal juice (ph 8) at 37 degrees c. after digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. from these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised  and antibacterial activity examined. strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against escherichia coli k12, bacillus cereus rt inf01 and listeria monocytogenes, less activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25 923 and no effect on lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. the pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. when comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, beta-lactoglobulin f(92-100) and beta-casein f(191-205) matched. no peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14-42) or lactoferrampin c f(268-284). human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence ltpvpelk. in such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. the present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.

TI  == effects of probiotic fermentation on the enhancement of biological and pharmacological activities of codonopsis lanceolata extracted by high pressure treatment.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the enhancement of antioxidant, antimicrobial, enzymatic, cytotoxic, and cognitive activities of codonopsis lanceolata extracted by high pressure treatment followed by probiotic fermentation. dried c. lanceolata samples were subjected to 400 mpa for 20 min and then fermented with bifidobacterium longum b6 (hpe-blf) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (hpe-lrf) at 37 degrees c for 7 days. compared to conventional extraction (ce-nf, 6.69 mg gae/g), the phenol amounts of hpe-blf and hpe-lrf were significantly increased to more than 8 mg gae/g, while the lowest flavonoid contents were observed for hpe-blf (0.44 mg re/ml) and hpe-lrf (0.45 mg re/ml) (p<0.05). cinnamic acid was the most abundant phenolic acid in the fermented c. lanceolata. the highest dpph scavenging activities were observed for hpe-blf and  hpe-lrf, with minimum ec(50) values of 1.26 and 1.18 mg/ml, respectively. the hpe-blf and hpe-lrf samples exhibited the most noticeable antimicrobial activities against staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella boydii (mics<15 mg/ml). the fermented c. lanceolata samples effectively inhibited alpha-glucosidase and tyrosinase activities and potentially improved a scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. the application of a fermentation process can effectively improve the biological and  pharmacological activities of high-pressure-extracted c. lanceolata by increasing the extraction efficacy and inducing probiotic conversion. the results suggest that the combined treatment of hpe and a fermentation process could be used as alternative extraction method over ce.

TI  == lingonberry (vaccinium vitis-idaea) and european cranberry (vaccinium microcarpon) proanthocyanidins: isolation, identification, and bioactivities.
AB  == european, small-fruited cranberries (vaccinium microcarpon) and lingonberries (vaccinium vitis-idaea) were characterized for their phenolic compounds and tested for antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiadhesive, and antiinflammatory effects. the main phenolic compounds in both lingonberries and cranberries were proanthocyanidins comprising 63-71% of the total phenolic content, but anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, and flavonols were also found. proanthocyanidins are polymeric phenolic compounds consisting mainly  of catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, and epigallocatechin units. in the present study, proanthocyanidins were divided into three groups: dimers and trimers, oligomers (mdp 4-10), and polymers (mdp > 10). catechin, epicatechin, a-type dimers and trimers were found to be the terminal units of isolated proanthocyanidin fractions. inhibitions of lipid oxidation in liposomes were over 70% and in emulsions over 85%, and in most cases the oligomeric or polymeric fraction was the most effective. polymeric proanthocyanidin extracts of lingonberries and cranberries were strongly antimicrobial against staphylococcus  aureus, whereas they had no effect on other bacterial strains such as salmonella  enterica sv. typhimurium, lactobacillus rhamnosus and escherichia coli. polymeric fraction of cranberries and oligomeric fractions of both lingonberries and cranberries showed an inhibitory effect on hemagglutination of e. coli, which expresses the m hemagglutin. cranberry phenolic extract inhibited lps-induced no  production in a dose-dependent manner, but it had no major effect on inos of cox-2 expression. at a concentration of 100 mug/ml cranberry phenolic extract inhibited lps-induced il-6, il-1beta and tnf-alpha production. lingonberry phenolics had no significant effect on il-1beta production but inhibited il-6 and tnf-alpha production at a concentration of 100 mug/ml similarly to cranberry phenolic extract. in conclusion the phenolics, notably proanthocyanidins (oligomers and polymers), in both lingonberries and cranberries exert multiple bioactivities that may be exploited in food development.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == tipsitis: incidence and outcome-a single centre experience.
AB  == introduction: infection of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (tipss) called 'tipsitis' has been reported but appears unusual. we report here our experience of patients who were diagnosed to have tipsitis at our centre. methods: retrospective single centre study. patients identified from a dedicated  data base. patients with tipss with otherwise unexplained sustained bacteraemia were included. results: over 14 years of age, of 785 patients with tipss, eight (1%) had tipsitis. indication for tipss: variceal bleed, seven; refractory ascites, one. child-pugh score: 8.3 (1.4). seven patients had overlapping stents  in situ. duration to tipsitis: 21.6 (7.1) months. at diagnosis, tipss was occluded in four and patent in three. tipsitis developed within 2 weeks of shunt  interventions in two patients and was owing to development of bilio-venous fistula in one. the organisms identified were: lactobacillus rhamnosus, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcusfaecium and staphylococcus aureus. median duration of antibiotic therapy: 3 (0.3-3) months. symptoms initially resolved in all but one. symptoms recurred in three and this was related to premature cessation of antibiotics in two. five patients died at a median 1.3 (0.3 to 33) months after tipsitis with tipsitis contributing to death  in three. conclusion: tipsitis is a rare but serious problem. it should be suspected in patients with tipss and unexplained sustained bacteraemia. shunt interventions, where tipss is inserted for variceal bleed, and use of overlapping shunts at tipss insertion may be risk factors for its development. prolonged antibiotics are usually required but tipsitis may recur despite apparently successful treatment.

AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the combined effects of probiotic fermentation and high-pressure extraction (hpe) on the functional properties of codonopsis lanceolata. the ground c. lanceolata samples were anaerobically fermented with lactobacillus acidophilus adh, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, or lactobacillus paracasei at 37 degrees c for 10 days and subjected to 500 mpa at 50 degrees c for 30 min. the extraction yields of c. lanceolata samples were noticeably increased to 29-32% by hpe. the b. longum-fermented c. lanceolata samples extracted by high pressure (blf-hpe) exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity (mic < 14 mg/ml) against listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, shigella boydii, and salmonella typhimurium. the nonfermented c. lanceolata samples extracted with high pressure  (nf-hpe) had the highest total phenolic content (13.3 mg of gae/g). the lowest effective concentrations (ec(50) and ec(0.5)) were 4.55 and 1.76 mg/ml, respectively, for nf-hpe extracts, indicating its highest antioxidant activity. the blf-hpe and l. rhamnosus-fermented c. lanceolata samples extracted by high pressure (lrf-hpe) exhibited the highest antimutagenic activities in s. typhimurium ta 100, which were 82 and 83% inhibition, respectively. the use of probiotic fermentation and hpe can produce more biologically active compounds in  c. lanceolata than the conventional solvent extraction method. the results provide pharmaceutically useful information for improving biological properties and an approach to drug discovery.

TI  == spr1630 is responsible for the lethality of clpx mutations in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the clp protease atpase subunit and chaperone clpx is dispensable in some bacteria, but it is thought to be essential in others, including streptococci and lactococci. we confirm that clpx is essential in the rx strain of streptococcus pneumoniae but show that the requirement for clpx can be relieved by point mutations, frame shifts, or deletion of the gene spr1630, which is found in many  isolates of s. pneumoniae. homologs occur frequently in staphylococcus aureus as  well as in a few strains of listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus johnsonii, and  lactobacillus rhamnosus. in each case, the spr1630 homolog is accompanied by a putative transcriptional regulator with an hth dna binding motif. in s. pneumoniae, the spr1630-spr1629 gene pair, accompanied by a rup element, occurs as an island inserted between the trpa and ccla genes in 15 of 22 sequenced genomes.

TI  == subtractive screening for probiotic properties of lactobacillus species from the  human gastrointestinal tract in the search for new probiotics.
AB  == in the search for new probiotics, 61 lactobacillus spp. isolates, belonging to 12 species and isolated as dominant lactic acid bacteria from the feces of healthy humans, were subjected to a subtractive system of in vitro analyses, which included desirable and undesirable traits. twenty-four isolates were able to grow in 2% bovine bile, of which 13 grew in acidified broth at ph 3.5 in acidified cysteine-containing mrs broth. intrinsic resistance to certain antimicrobial agents (cefoxitin, metronidazole, vancomycin) was observed in most isolates, but  atypical resistances to erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline were also found in 5 strains. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase and moderate beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in 2 strains. two lactobacillus gasseri and 2 lactobacillus paracasei selected strains inhibited several intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including strains of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus. they also adhered to human caco-2 and ht-29 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg, and were unable to degrade pig gastric mucin in a plate assay. together, these results suggest these 4 strains to be good probiotic candidates, concluding that the subtractive screening devised in this work could be a valuable tool in large-scale surveys for probiotics.

TI  == murine immunomodulation of il-10 and il-12 induced by new isolates from avian type 2 lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == several bacterial and immunogenic factors are involved in the host response to probiotic strains of lactobacillus. here, we report the isolation of new intestinal lactobacilli from chicken, with different immunomodulating properties  on lymphoid cells from sjl and c57bl/6 mice. analysis of biochemical markers in the lactobacillus acidophilus cba4p, cba3p, and tpa3p isolates reveal that these  bacterial isolates belong to the type 2 prototype, although they differ from each other. the effect of conditioned media (cm) from sjl- and c57bl/6-derived peritoneal macrophages incubated with the 3 sonicated bacterial isolates from chicken, as well as with lactobacillus rhamnosus 9595, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, or staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan were compared. our results show that the cm of macrophages from c57bl/6 and sjl mice treated with the cba4p isolate stimulated syngeneic splenic lymphocytes at a level similar to  the one induced with cm from peptidoglycan-stimulated macrophages. in contrast, the cm from tpa3p- and cba3p-treated macrophages promoted low or no stimulation of lymphoid cells. incubation of splenic cells with cm from macrophages treated with l. rhamnosus or tpa3p led to a relative decrease in the percentages of splenic cd4+ t cells, whereas the relative percentages of b cells increased. the  cba4p and cba3p isolates induced higher levels of gamma interferon when compared  with the tpa3p isolate. the effects of the lactobacilli isolates differed according to the mouse strain used but correlated with the production of macrophagic tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 6, 10, and 12 and with the modulation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk). taken together, these results indicate that the immunomodulating properties of the new  l. acidophilus isolates depend on their capacity to induce production of interleukins 10 and 12 by macrophages, which is under genetic control and depends on the p38 mapk pathway.

AB  == cd14 is expressed on the cell surface of various antigen-presenting cells, and cd83 is a maturation marker for dendritic cells (dc). cd14 and cd83 are also present as soluble proteins, and both have immunoregulatory functions. we examined whether neonatal cord blood monocytes or dc released soluble cd14 (scd14) or scd83 when exposed to the commensal intestinal bacteria clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis. we found that the gram-positive bacteria c. perfringens and s. aureus, but not gram-negative bacteria, induced the release of scd14 from  monocytes. dc, on the other hand, released scd14 in response to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. moreover, the expression of the virulence factor staphylococcal protein a seemed to be important for s. aureus-induced scd14 production from both monocytes and dc. soluble cd83 was released from dc, but not from monocytes, when exposed to both gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria. finally, to investigate whether scd14 or scd83 could modulate neonatal allergen-induced t-cell differentiation, dc were exposed to birch allergen alone or in the presence of scd14 or scd83 and then cocultured with autologous t cells. we demonstrate that scd14 and scd83 inhibited the birch  allergen-induced th2 differentiation by suppressing interleukin 13 production. together, these results suggest that the commensal intestinal flora may be an important stimulus for the developing immune system by inducing the immunoregulatory proteins scd14 and scd83, which may be involved in preventing t-cell sensitization to allergens in infants.

TI  == adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's  feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the  intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains  also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus adheres to human intestinal mucus but can be displaced by certain lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == there is increasing evidence that staphylococcus aureus may colonize the intestinal tract, especially among hospitalized patients. as staph. aureus has been found to be associated with certain gastrointestinal diseases, it has become important to study whether this bacterium can colonize the intestinal tract and if so, whether it is possible to prevent colonization. adhesion is the first step in colonization; this study shows that staph. aureus adheres to mucus from resected human intestinal tissue. certain lactic acid bacteria (lab), mainly commercial probiotics, were able to reduce adhesion and viability of adherent staph. aureus. in displacement assays the amount of adherent staph. aureus in human intestinal mucus was reduced 39-44% by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. moreover, adherent lactobacillus reuteri, lc. lactis and p. freudenreichii reduced viability of adherent staph. aureus by 27-36%, depending on the strain, after 2 h incubation. this was probably due to the production of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide and possibly in the case of l. reuteri to the production of reuterin. this study shows for the first time that staph. aureus can adhere to human intestinal mucus and adherent bacteria can be displaced and killed by certain lab strains via in situ production of antimicrobial substances.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysostaphin and a listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage  endolysin produced and secreted by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the expression and secretion signals of the sep protein from lactobacillus fermentum br11 were used to direct export of two peptidoglycan hydrolases by lb.  fermentum br11, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917 and lactococcus lactis mg1363. the production levels, hydrolytic and bacteriocidal activities of the listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase endolysin ply511 and the glycylglycine endopeptidase lysostaphin were examined. buffering of the growth media to a neutral ph allowed detection of ply511 and lysostaphin peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity from all lactic acid bacteria. it was found that purified ply511 has a ph activity range similar to that of lysostaphin with both enzymes functioning optimally under alkaline conditions. supernatants from lactobacilli expressing lysostaphin reduced viability of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) by approximately 8 log(10) cfu/ml compared to controls. however, supernatants containing ply511 were unable to control l. monocytogenes growth. in coculture experiments, both lb. plantarum and lb. fermentum synthesizing lysostaphin were able to effectively reduce mrsa cell numbers by >7.4 and 1.7 log(10)cfu/ml, respectively, while lactic acid bacteria secreting ply511 were unable to significantly inhibit the growth of l. monocytogenes. our results demonstrate that lysostaphin and ply511 can be expressed in an active form from different lactic acid bacteria and lysostaphin showed superior killing activity.  lactobacilli producing lysostaphin may have potential for in situ biopreservation in foodstuffs or for prevention of s. aureus infections.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == [search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  == for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a  complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB  == aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus,  known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == prophylactic lactobacillus gg reduces antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children  with respiratory infections: a randomized study.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial treatment may disturb the colonization resistance of gastrointestinal microflora, which may induce clinical symptoms, most commonly diarrhea. the severity of antibiotic-associated diarrhea may range from a brief,  self-limiting disease to devastating diarrhea with electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, crampy abdominal pain, pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, or even death. the incidence of diarrhea in children receiving a single antimicrobial treatment is unclear. in addition to more critical use of antimicrobials, adjunctive preventive measures to antibiotic-associated diarrhea  are needed. the objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of diarrhea after antimicrobial treatment in children with no history of antimicrobial use during the previous 3 months. another aim of this study was to assess the preventive potential of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lactobacillus gg; american type culture collection 53103), a probiotic strain with a documented safety record and a therapeutic effect in viral gastroenteritis on antibiotic-associated diarrhea. methods: oral antimicrobial agents were prescribed for the treatment of acute respiratory infections at the clinics of the health care center of the city of tampere or tampere university hospital, finland, to 167 patients who were invited to participate in the study. of the patients, 48 were lost to follow-up;  therefore, the final study population consisted of 119 children from 2 weeks to 12. 8 years of age (mean: 4.5 years). all study subjects met the inclusion criteria: they had not received any antimicrobial medication during the previous  3 months, they did not suffer from gastrointestinal disorders, and they did not need intravenous antimicrobial treatment. the patients were randomized to receive placebo or 2 x 10(10) colony-forming units of lactobacillus gg in capsules given  twice daily during the antimicrobial treatment. lactobacillus gg and placebo capsules were indistinguishable in appearance and taste. the parents kept a daily symptom diary and recorded stool frequency and consistency at home for 3 months.  diarrhea was defined as at least three watery or loose stools per day for a minimum of 2 consecutive days. in the case of diarrhea, viral (adenovirus, rotavirus, calicivirus and astrovirus) and bacterial (salmonella, shigella, yersinia, campylobacter, clostridium difficile, staphylococcus aureus, and yeasts) analyses were studied in fecal samples. the metabolic activity of the gut microflora was assessed by analysis of fecal urease, beta-glucosidase, and beta-glucuronidase activities. the primary outcome measure was diarrhea during the first 2 weeks after the beginning of the antimicrobial treatment, because this period most likely reflects the effects of antimicrobial use. secondary outcome measures were the activities of fecal urease, beta-glucuronidase, and beta-glucosidase. results: on the entire follow-up, 80% of any gastrointestinal symptoms were reported during the first 2 weeks after the beginning of the antimicrobial treatment. the incidence of diarrhea was 5% in the lactobacillus gg group and 16% in the placebo group within 2 weeks of antimicrobial therapy (chi(2) = 3.82). the treatment effect (95% confidence interval) of lactobacillus  gg was -11% (-21%-0%). in diarrheal episodes, the viral and bacterial analyses were positive for clostridium difficile in 2 cases and for norwalk-like calicivirus in 3 cases. the age of the patients with diarrhea was between 3 months and 5 years in 75% of cases in both groups. the severity of diarrhea was comparable in the study groups, as evidenced by similar stool frequency (mean: 5  per day; range: 3-6) and the duration of diarrhea (mean: 4 days; range: 2-8). the activities of fecal urease and beta-glucuronidase, but not beta-glucosidase, changed significantly after the beginning of the antimicrobial treatment in the lactobacillus gg group and in the placebo group alike.

TI  == effect of intestinal lactobacillus starter cultures on the behaviour of staphylococcus aureus in fermented sausage.
AB  == the effects of lactobacillus strains isolated from intestinal tracts for starter  cultures of fermented sausage on the growth rate and enterotoxin production of staphylococcus aureus were studied at two fermentation temperatures of 20 degrees c and 35 degrees c. initial inoculated populations in the sausage batter were approx. 10(4) cfu/g for s. aureus and 10(7) cfu/g for the lactobacillus strain as a starter culture. samples of sausage were taken during fermentation and analyzed for ph and microbial populations. in control lots without inoculation of lactobacillus strains, staphylococcal enterotoxin was detected during fermentation at each temperature. of three intestinal lactobacillus strains, l. rhamnosus ferm p-15120 and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei ferm p-15121 inhibited the growth and enterotoxin production of s. aureus in sausages during fermentation at both temperatures, although l. acidophilus ferm p-15119 could not satisfactorily suppress them. the effect of the two selected strains in meat fermentation (i.e., fermentation time, acid production, inhibition of s. aureus)  was the same as that of a commercial l. sake starter culture for fermented sausage. these results suggest the intestinal lactobacillus strains selected in this study could be utilized as a starter culture to produce new fermented meat products that are microbiologically safe.

TI  == influence of lactobacilli on the adhesion of staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans to fibers and epithelial cells.
AB  == the ability of organisms to adhere to and form biofilms on fibrous materials is believed to be an important initiating step in the induction of several diseases, such as toxic shock syndrome. using an in vitro assay, a moderately hydrophobic strain of staphylococcus aureus (water contact angle 35 degrees) and a hydrophilic candida albicans (shown by a hexadecane test) were highly adherent to commercial diaper fibers. the lumen side of the diaper was porous and the fibers  were very hydrophobic (> 140 degrees), but the internal section was very hydrophilic (0 degrees), presumably for lus strains was present. surfaces precoated with lactobacilli inhibited staphylococcal adhesion by 26-97%, and candida by 0-67%. when the lactobacilli were used to challenge adherent pathogens, there was 99% displacement of the s. aureus and up to 91% displacement of c. albicans. hydrophobic l. acidophilus 76 (54 degrees) and t-13 (80 degrees)  were the most effective of five lactobacillus isolates tested at interference by  precoating. the moderately hydrophilic l. casei var rhamnosus gr-1 (33 degrees) was the most effective at displacing the yeast. experiments with uroepithelial cells also showed that the lactobacilli could significantly interfere with the adhesion of both pathogens to the cells. the results demonstrate the rapidity with which two pathogens adhered to fibers and epithelial cells, and raised the possibility that members of the normal female urogenital flora might interfere with infections caused by these organisms.
