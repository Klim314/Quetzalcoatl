TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria in ontario, 2010-2011.
AB  == the local epidemiology of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in anaerobic bacteria is important in guiding the empiric treatment of infections. however, susceptibility data are very limited on anaerobic organisms, particularly among non-bacteroides organisms. to determine susceptibility profiles of clinically-significant anaerobic bacteria in ontario canada, anaerobic isolates from sterile sites submitted to public health ontario laboratory (phol) for identification and susceptibility testing were included in this study. using the  e-test method, isolates were tested for various antimicrobials including, penicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole. the mic results were interpreted based on guidelines published by  clinical and laboratory standards institute. of 2527 anaerobic isolates submitted to phol, 1412 were either from sterile sites or bronchial lavage, and underwent susceptibility testing. among bacteroides fragilis, 98.2%, 24.7%, 1.6%, and 1.2%  were resistant to penicillin, clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole, respectively. clostridium perfringens was universally susceptible  to penicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem, whereas 14.2% of other clostridium spp. were resistant to penicillin. among gram-positive anaerobes, actinomyces spp., parvimonas micra and propionibacterium spp. were universally susceptible to beta-lactams. eggerthella spp., collinsella spp., and eubacterium  spp. showed variable resistance to penicillin. among gram-negative anaerobes, fusobacterium spp., prevotella spp., and veillonella spp. showed high resistance  to penicillin but were universally susceptible to meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. the detection of metronidazole resistant b. fragilis is  concerning as occurrence of these isolates is extremely rare. these data highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance to provide clinically relevant information to clinicians for empiric management of infections caused by anaerobic organisms.

TI  == coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  == coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. the aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and  ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. while 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less  common (4% incidence). coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from bacteroides fragilis with clostridium perfringens, and bifidobacterium adolescentis with c. perfringens. oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from b. adolescentis with fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii with c. perfringens and f. nucleatum with lactobacillus paracasei. heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of propolis and other substances against selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial effect of ethanol extract of propolis (eep) and intracanal medicaments calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol by means of the macrodilution method using the reinforced clostridial medium (rcm) and brucella and brain heart infusion media. study design: the antimicrobial agents were sequentially diluted  and tested against anaerobic bacteria prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces israelii, and clostridium perfringens and against enterococcus faecalis, with the 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml standardized inocula. the tubes  were anaerobically incubated and the minimum inhibitory concentration was detected. blood agar rcm subcultures were performed to provide minimum bactericidal concentration. the results were analyzed by analysis of variance test. results: all drugs were effective against all tested strains, without statistical differences. e. faecalis was the less susceptible strain, and rcm broth promoted faster bacterial growth, but there were no significant differences in these results. ethanol did not influence the antimicrobial effect of eep.

TI  == in vitro activities of dalbavancin and nine comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and corynebacteria.
AB  == dalbavancin is a novel semisynthetic glycopeptide with enhanced activity against  gram-positive species. its comparative in vitro activities and those of nine comparator agents, including daptomycin, vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin, against 290 recent gram-positive clinical isolates strains, as determined by the nccls agar dilution method, were studied. the mics  of dalbavancin at which 90% of various isolates tested were inhibited were as follows: actinomyces spp., 0.5 microg/ml; clostridium clostridioforme, 8 microg/ml; c. difficile, 0.25 microg/ml; c. innocuum, 0.25 microg/ml; c. perfringens, 0.125 microg/ml; c. ramosum, 1 microg/ml; eubacterium spp., 1 microg/ml; lactobacillus spp., >32 microg/ml, propionibacterium spp., 0.5 microg/ml; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.25 microg/ml. dalbavancin was 1 to 3 dilutions more active than vancomycin against most strains. dalbavancin exhibited excellent activity against gram-positive strains tested and warrants clinical evaluation.

TI  == in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, quinupristin- dalfopristin, linezolid, and five other antimicrobials against 307 gram-positive anaerobic and  31 corynebacterium clinical isolates.
AB  == the activities of daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide, and eight other agents were determined against 338 strains of gram-positive anaerobic bacteria and corynebacteria by the nccls reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella agar for the anaerobes and mueller-hinton agar for the corynebacteria. the daptomycin mics determined on ca(2+)-supplemented (50 mg/liter) brucella agar plates were one- to fourfold lower than those determined in unsupplemented media. daptomycin was highly active (mics, <or=2 microg/ml) against many strains including 36 of 37 peptostreptococci, 37 of 48 isolates of the eubacterium group, and all strains of propionibacterium spp., clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, and other clostridium spp. it was fourfold or greater more active than vancomycin against clostridium innocuum and 16 of 34 strains of vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli. three strains of c. difficile for which quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid mics were >8 microg/ml were inhibited by  <1 microg of daptomycin per ml. daptomycin mics were >or=4 microg/ml for most strains of clostridium clostridioforme, clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium tertium, and clostridium ramosum; the isolates were generally more resistant to other antimicrobials. daptomycin was two- to fourfold less active against actinomyces spp. than vancomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, or linezolid. twenty-nine of 31 strains of corynebacterium spp., including corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium amycolatum, and corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of daptomycin per ml. for two strains of "corynebacterium aquaticum," 8 microg of daptomycin per ml was required for inhibition. daptomycin demonstrated very good activities against a broad range of gram-positive organisms including vancomycin-resistant c. innocuum and lactobacillus strains and quinupristin-dalfopristin- and linezolid-resistant c. difficile strains.

TI  == meningitis and shunt infection caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology and management of meningitis and shunt infections caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. the predominant anaerobes recovered in meningitis are bacteriodes spp., bacteriodes fragilis, fusobacterium spp., and clostridium spp. peptostreptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, propionibacterium acnes, and eubacterium are less commonly isolated. the predisposing conditions for meningitis are acute or chronic middle-ear infection, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and pulmonary infections. in newborn and preterm infants  the predisposing conditions are rupture of membranes, amnionitis, fetal distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastric perforation and subsequent ileus followed by bacteremia, aspiration pneumonitis and septicemia, infected ventriculoperitoneal  or ventriculoatrial shunt, and complicating dermal sinus tract infections. shunt  infection with propionibacterium spp. has been reported in children, especially in association with ventriculoauricular and ventriculoperitoneal shunts. clostridium perfringens has been recovered from infants with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. multiple-organism meningitis was reported as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts that perforated the gastrointestinal tract. early recognition and effective therapy are essential to recovery. management of meningitis includes the use of antimicrobials effective against anaerobes that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. these include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, and carbapenems. the treatment of shunt infection includes antimicrobial therapy and removal of the shunt.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of some pacific northwest woods against anaerobic bacteria and yeast.
AB  == extracts of woods commonly used for animal bedding were tested for antimicrobial  activity. essential oils from alaska cedar (chamaecyparis nootkatensis), western  juniper (juniperus occidentalis) and old growth douglas fir (pseudotsuga menziesii) as well as methanol extracts of wood from these trees plus western red cedar (thuja plicata) and ponderosa pine (pinus ponderosa) were tested for antimicrobial activity against anaerobic bacteria and yeast. the test microbes included fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, actinomyces bovis and candida albicans which are common to foot diseases and other infections in animals. the essential oils and methanol extracts were tested using a standardized broth assay. only extracts of alaska cedar and western juniper showed significant antimicrobial activity against each of the microbes tested. the essential oil of douglas fir did show antimicrobial activity against a. bovis at the concentrations tested. the methanol extracts of the heartwood of douglas fir and the sapwood of ponderosa pine showed no antimicrobial activity. the major chemical components of western juniper (cedrol and alpha- and beta-cedrene) and alaska cedar (nootkatin) were also tested. in western juniper, alpha- and beta-cedrene were found to be active components. nootkatin showed activity only against c. albicans. the inhibitory activity in alaska cedar oil was high enough  to justify further efforts to define the other chemical components responsible for the antimicrobial activity.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == acceleration of hyaluronidase production in the course of batch cultivation of clostridium perfringens can be achieved with bacteriolytic enzymes.
AB  == as clostridium perfringens hyaluronidase has cell-bound enzyme features, an enzymatic approach has been designed to facilitate the release of hyaluronidase into culture through increasing the clostridial cell wall permeability. as a result of the application of lytic peptidase from actinomyces rutgersensis, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase and beta-n-acetylmuramidase (both from bacillus subtilis) commercially available preparations at the end of the producer's exponential growth phase, a 5.3-, 4.8- and 4.0-fold acceleration, respectively (but no enhancement), of hyaluronidase production in the course of batch cultivation of cl. perfringens has been achieved. this also resulted in an approximately 10-fold reduction in undesirable side lecithinase activity irrespective of the bacteriolytic enzyme preparation used.

TI  == susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in auckland: 1991-1996.
AB  == aim: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of local anaerobic bacteria. method: the antimicrobial susceptibility of 357 obligate anaerobes collected between 1991 and 1997 was determined by a standard agar dilution method. isolates tested included bacteroides spp. 131, fusobacterium spp. 12, prevotella spp. 13,  veillonella spp. 5, clostridium perfringens 27, other clostridium spp. 29, propionibacterium spp. 57, actinomyces spp. 7, other non-sporing gram-positive bacilli 28 and peptostreptococcus spp. 48. ten antimicrobials were tested: penicillin, amoxycillin/ clavulanic acid, pipercillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. results: imipenem, pipercillin/tazobactam, meropenem and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were active against virtually all anaerobes tested. metronidazole was active against all anaerobic gram-negative bacteria and clostridium spp., but had variable activity against other anaerobes. cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against bacteroides spp., with 76%, 64% and 15% of bacteroides spp. being susceptible to cefoxitin, cefotetan and ceftriaxone, respectively. penicillin had poor activity against anaerobic gram negative bacilli. actinomyces and propionibacterium spp. were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested except metronidazole. variable results were obtained with other antimicrobial-organism combinations. comparison of results with data from a previously published survey  showed little change in susceptibility except for increased resistance of bacteroides fragilis to ceftriaxone and clostridium species (not c perfringens) to clindamycin. conclusion: our results update the local susceptibility profile of anaerobic bacteria and may be considered when choosing an antimicrobial agent  for prophylaxis or treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == incidence risk and aetiology of mammary abnormalities in dry ewes in 10 flocks in southern greece.
AB  == in a field investigation of 10 flocks in southern greece, 3367 dairy ewes were examined twice, in order to estimate the incidence risk and the aetiology of mammary abnormalities during the dry-period. abnormal secretion, lumps, nodules,  diffuse hardness, abscesses and cysts were the abnormalities detected. the cumulative incidence of mammary abnormalities during the dry-period was 5.1% (95% confidence interval: 4.4-5.8%); 47% of the cases detected developed during the first three weeks after cessation of lactation. despite variation in the flock size, there was no between-flock variation in the risk of a ewe developing mammary abnormalities. staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative isolates) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from mammary samples; actinomyces pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, streptococci and  escherichia coli were also isolated. resistance was encountered among the staphylococcal isolates.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii.
AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c in two different transport systems.
AB  == the survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c was evaluated. the transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified stuart transport medium (mst), and a viscose swab in modified siff transport medium (btm) (bionor). the following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; fusobacterium necrophorum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides intermedius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, clostridium perfringens, clostridium tetani, and actinomyces  israelii. additionally, a mixture of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was tested together with bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium necrophorum and clostridium perfringens. both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the btm medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the mst in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%)  of the experiments (p < 0.05). there was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different b. fragilis strains. there was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees c compared to 22 degrees c, except for fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees c in the bionor transport system.

TI  == [a case of disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) in a cow with endometritis and fetal death].
AB  == acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) was diagnosed in a 3 1/2 year  old cow of the simmental breed. the cow was little less than 6 months pregnant and was admitted to the clinic because of severely disturbed general health. the  most important clinical findings were increased heart and breathing rate, rectal  temperature of 39.9 degrees c, nosebleed and petechiae on the nasal mucosa. additionally, the cow showed petechiae on the vaginal mucosa, haemorrhage from the rectum lasting several hours after rectal examination and severe haemoglobinuria. haematological and biochemical examinations showed increased liver enzymes and severe changes in all coagulation parameters (platelet count, pt, ptt, thrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products). based on the mentioned findings the diagnosis dic was made. possible causes were severe necrotic endometritis and placentitis combined with fetal death. high counts of escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens were determined in liver, lung and abomasal contents of the aborted fetus as well as in the placenta. uterine secretion contained actinomyces pyogenes besides.

TI  == in vitro activity of imipenem against gram-positive anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of imipenem, a new penem antibiotic, was determined against 210 clinical gram-positive anaerobic isolates and compared with the activities of metronidazole, clindamycin, cefoxitin, moxalactam, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone and cefotiam. all investigated strains were inhibited by a 4-mg/l concentration of imipenem. cefoxitin demonstrated good activity against most strains with exception of some clostridium difficile and clostridium ramosum strains. cephalosporins were classed in decreasing activity order as follows: cefoxitin moxalactam ceftriaxone ceftizoxime cefotiam. metronidazole had better activity against clostridium spp. than against non-sporulated bacilli. clindamycin resistance rates were superior to 10% for most groups, with the exception of clostridium perfringens. actinomyces and bifidobacterium. imipenem was the most potent inhibitor, as 81% and 95% of tested strains were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l respectively.

TI  == surface localization of sialic acid on actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == this study reports the presence of sialic acid in actinomyces viscosus strains t14v and t14av. mild acid hydrolysis of whole organisms released a compound which reacted positively in the periodate-thiobarbituric acid, direct ehrlich's and resorcinol assays, and which co-chromatographed on paper with authentic n-acetylneuraminic acid. strain t14v contained 10-fold greater concentrations of  sialic acid than did strain t14av. sialic acid content was dependent upon the stage of growth of the culture, reaching a maximum in early stationary phase. epifluorescence microscopy of fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated limulus polyphemus agglutinin (lpa), a lectin specific for sialic acid, revealed  a uniform distribution of bound lectin on the surfaces of strains t14v and t14av. additional evidence for surface localization was obtained by demonstration of whole-cell agglutination of both strains with lpa. all lpa interactions with a. viscosus were inhibited by the presence of 0.1 m-n-acetylneuraminic acid. neuraminidases from clostridium perfringens, arthrobacter ureafaciens and vibrio  cholerae did not release detectable amounts of sialic acid, but the extracellular enzyme from a. viscosus cleaved amounts equivalent to those obtained by acid hydrolysis. other laboratory strains (w1053, m100, w859, 5-5s, rc45, atcc 19246,  and 'binder') as well as recent clinical isolates of a. viscosus were agglutinated by lpa and released sialic acid upon mild acid hydrolysis. surface-available sialic acid has been implicated in the inhibition of alternative complement pathway activation and subsequent opsonophagocytosis. thus the occurrence of surface sialic acid in a. viscosus may represent a mechanism of pathogenesis for this oral bacterium.

TI  == a note on ultra-violet red fluorescence of anaerobic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == anaerobes other than the bacteroides melaninogenicus group isolated from clinical material produce an ultra-violet red fluorescence when grown under certain conditions in vitro. these organisms include other members of the genus bacteroides as well as strains of some species of clostridium, bifidobacterium and actinomyces. the major fluorescent pigment was identified as protoporphyrin ix. factors necessary for the production of fluorescence are the presence of blood or haem and a fermentable carbohydrate during growth on a solid medium. fluorescence intensity was related to the concentration of blood and fermentable  carbohydrate present but was independent of inoculum size. certain commercially available blood agar bases designed specifically for the isolation of fastidious  anaerobes from clinical material which contain added carbohydrate were shown to induce fluorescence in certain organisms. this may lead to the misidentification  of some anaerobes as b. melaninogenicus.

TI  == agar medium for gas-liquid chromatography of anaerobes.
AB  == this study evaluates a method of performing gas-liquid chromatography (glc) by direct extraction of fatty acids from agar for identification of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria. the potential use of agar cultures for glc was studied by comparing chromatograms of 117 clinically isolated anaerobes grown in  peptone yeast glucose broth and chopped meat carbohydrate broth, and on enriched  brucella blood agar. for 98 of 117 anaerobes, fatty acid patterns from agar cultures were similar to those in broth. significant differences were only found  with streptococcus intermedius, clostridium perfringens, clostridium tertium, and actinomyces species, which produced less of certain fatty acids on agar than in broth. results of this study indicate that glc of short chain fatty acids produced on agar medium by anaerobes, combined with simple tests such as gram's stain and colonial morphology, may allow fir direct presumptive genus identification from an initial pure agar culture.

TI  == in vitro activity of sch 34343 and cefbuperazone against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activities of sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic, and cefbuperazone,  a new cephamycin antibiotic, were determined against 459 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of imipenem and cefoxitin, respectively, by an agar dilution method. both penems showed potent and similar activity against all anaerobic bacteria tested, particularly peptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens. all organisms except a single  strain of fusobacterium necrogenes were inhibited by an 8 micrograms/ml concentration of either sch 34343 or imipenem. overall, gram-positive bacilli, particularly lactobacillus species, clostridium difficile, and bifidobacterium and actinomyces species, were relatively more resistant to either penem than other genera of anaerobic bacteria tested. cefbuperazone demonstrated only modest activity against a wide spectrum of anaerobic bacteria. it had excellent and selective activity against b. fragilis and bacteroides vulgatus but was highly inactive against bacteroides distasonis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron within the b. fragilis group. both cephamycins showed virtually no activity against c. difficile and lactobacillus spp. although cefbuperazone was more active against bifidobacterium spp., it had less activity against fusobacterium spp., eubacterium spp., and all bacteroides spp. other than b. fragilis and b. vulgatus.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. anaerobes can be  isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. the genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) offteroides, clostridium, gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, actinomyces, and bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (veillonella and acidaminococcus). clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.

TI  == adaptation of an automated microbiology system for the growth of anaerobes and performance of antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  == the authors examined the feasibility of growing anaerobes in an automated microbiology system (ms-2) and using the system for antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. a total of 78 of 100 clinical anaerobic isolates grew in the ms-2 if 100 microl of an undiluted overnight suspension of organisms was inoculated into at least 2.5 ml of freshly prepared wilkins-chalgren broth supplemented with 0.07% agar. susceptibility test results were determined with 50 anaerobes tested against seven antibiotics in the ms-2 system and were compared with results determined with a qualitative reference susceptibility test method. of the 350 tests, 88% of the ms-2 results agreed with the qualitative reference results. false-susceptible and false-resistant results were reported for 8.6 and 3.4%, respectively, of the ms-2 results.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  == reference data on the overall resistance patterns of anaerobic bacteria are needed since in individual clinical cases susceptibility testing is complicated by the long generation time and difficulties of test conditions. benzylpenicillin and tetracyclines are the drugs of choice against clostridium perfringens. newer  cephalosporins are also active, whereas other clostridium species have been found resistant. beta-lactam antibiotics show high activity against peptococcaceae; resistance to clindamycin should be noted, however. the good in vitro activity of tetracyclines, clindamycin and erythromycin against propionibacterium acnes could be confirmed in the systemic and local therapy of acne vulgaris. in contrast to gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, only some penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives are sufficiently active against gram-negative rods of the bacteroides group. sporadic resistance is seen to the newer tetrayclines, nitroimidazole compounds and to lincomycins. nevertheless, these substances must be considered as standard therapeutics for infections caused by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. it should be mentioned that cefoxitin may offer new therapeutic possibilities.

TI  == neuraminidase-dependent hamagglutination of human erythrocytes by human strains of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == human a, b, and o erythrocytes (rbc) were agglutinated by many human strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii. at 37 degrees c, these bacterium-mediated hemagglutination reactions required the action of bacterial neuraminidase upon the rbc; however, at 4 degrees c, the requirement for neuraminidase was not as striking. bacterial cell suspensions which caused hemagglutination at 37 degrees  c contained both soluble extracellular and cell-associated neuraminidase activities as shown by enzyme assays using a soluble substrate (i.e., alpha 1-acid glycoprotein). bacterium-mediated hemagglutination occurred only in the presence of soluble neuraminidase activity, and the rate of hemagglutination could be inhibited by 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-n-acetylneuraminic acid, a competitive  inhibitor of purified soluble neuraminidase from a. viscosus t14v. suspensions of bacteria which contained only cell-associated neuraminidase activity were unable  to initiate hemagglutination, but they caused immediate hemagglutination when mixed with neuraminidase-treated rbc. all hemagglutination reactions were reversible in the presence of 0.02 m lactose and were abolished by heating (85 degrees c for 30 min) the actinomycete cells but not the rbc. the proposed mechanism of hemagglutination involves two sequential steps: (i) the action of neuraminidase to unmask galactose-containing receptors on the rbc and (ii) the multivalent binding of these receptors by many low-affinity lection sites on the  bacterial surface.

AB  == a survey for anaerobic bacteria was conducted in 314 clinical specimens from dogs and cats. a total of 187 anaerobic isolates in pure and mixed culture were isolated from 111 of the specimens that contained anaerobic bacteria. common isolated included actinomyces (9.1%), clostridium perfringens (19.3%), other clostridium spp (11.2%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (7.5%), bacteroides melaninogenicus (13.4%), other bacteroides spp (17.6%), and fusobacterium necrophorum (5.3%). anaerobic bacteria were involved in serious lesions that often were life threatening to the animals. antibiotic susceptibility data indicated that the lincomycin family, the penicillin family, chloramphenicol, and cephaloridine are preferred drugs for treatment of anaerobic infections. data from the survey were used in formulation of a table to aid practitioners in clinical diagnosis of disease caused by anaerobes. clostridium perfringens was isolated in large numbers from five of six dogs with a clinical diagnosis of canine hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and from one cat with hemorrhagic diarrhea. experimental infections were induced in rats, using caine feces as inoculum. induced lesions contained aerobic and anaerobic bacteria similar to those bacteria isolated in the clinical survey, indicating that feces may serve as a major source of these bacteria in clinical infections of the dog.

TI  == isolation of clostridium in human infections: evaluation of 114 cases.
AB  == one hundred fifty-two strains of clostridium were isolated from 144 patients over a 14-month-peroid. these included 23 recognized species and 23 strains that were  unclassified. soft tissues or abscesses yielded 84 strains of clostridium. intraabdominal sites predominated, but clostridia were recovered from empyema, carcinoma, frostbite with gas gangrene, muscle abscess, aortic graft, and brain abscess. blood cultures yielded 65 strains of clostridium from 49 patients, representing 0.3% of 16,314 blood cultures (or 2.6% of 2,168 positive cultures).  clostridium perfringens was most common in blood, accounting for 37 isolates (57%). clostridial bacteremia was often unrelated to the clinical setting and was found in alcoholics with aspiration or streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, meningococcemia, and infantile gastroenteritis.  in 20 of the 49 patients (41%), aerobic or other anaerobic bacteria were cultured concurrently from the blood. thus, clostridial bacteremia should be interpreted with caution since there may be little correlation with the patient's clinical condition.
