TI  - Simultaneous ethanol and bacterial ice nuclei production from sugar beet molasses by a Zymomonas mobilis CP4 mutant expressing the inaZ gene of Pseudomonas syringae in continuous culture.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this work was to construct a Zymomonas mobilis mutant capable of  simultaneous ethanol and ice nuclei production from agricultural by-product such as sugar beet molasses, in steady-state continuous culture. METHODS AND RESULTS: A sucrose-hypertolerant mutant of Z. mobilis strain CP4, named suc40, capable of growing on 40% (w/v) sucrose medium was isolated following N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine treatment. Plasmid pDS3154 carrying the inaZ gene of Pseudomonas syringae was conjugally transferred and expressed in suc40. The potential for simultaneous ethanol and bacterial ice nuclei production was assessed in steady-state continuous cultures over a range of dilution rates from 0.04 to 0.13 h(-1). In addition, the fatty acid and phospholipid profile of the three strains was also investigated. Ethanol production up to 43 g l(-1) was achieved at dilution rates below 0.10 h(-1) in sugar beet molasses. Ice nucleation activity gradually increased with increasing dilution rate and the greatest activity, -3.4 log (ice nuclei per cell), was observed at the highest dilution rate (0.13 h(-1)). Both mutant strains displayed a different fatty acid and phospholipid profile compared with the wild-type strain. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of the mutant and recombinant plasmid-containing strains to grow on high sugar concentrations and in high osmotic pressure environments (molasses) can be attributed to their phospholipid and fatty acid contents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Taking into account that sugar beet molasses is a low cost agricultural by-product, the simultaneous ethanol and bacterial ice nucleation production achieved under the studied conditions is considered very promising for industrial applications.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression in Escherichia coli of levansucrase  genes from the plant pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola.
AB  - Plant-pathogenic bacteria produce various extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) which may function as virulence factors in diseases caused by these bacteria. The EPS levan is synthesized by the extracellular enzyme levansucrase in Pseudomonas syringae, Erwinia amylovora, and other bacterial species. The lsc genes encoding levansucrase from P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NCPPB 1321 were cloned, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Heterologous expression of the lsc gene in Escherichia coli was found in four and two genomic library clones of strains PG4180 and NCPPB 1321, respectively. A 3. 0-kb PstI fragment common to all six clones conferred levan synthesis on E. coli when further subcloned. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 1,248-bp open reading frame (ORF) derived from PG4180 and a 1,296-bp ORF derived from NCPPB 1321, which were both designated lsc. Both ORFs showed high homology to the E. amylovora and Zymomonas mobilis lsc genes at the nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequence levels. Levansucrase was not secreted into the supernatant but was located in the periplasmic fraction of E. coli harboring the lsc gene. Expression of lsc was found to be dependent on the vector-based Plac promoter, indicating that the native promoter of lsc was not functional in E. coli. Insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette in the lsc gene abolished levan synthesis in E. coli. A PCR screening with primers derived from lsc of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 allowed the detection of this gene in a number of related bacteria.
TI  - Surface display of Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase by using the ice-nucleation protein of Pseudomonas syringae.
AB  - The ice-nucleation protein (Inp) is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored outer membrane protein found in some Gram-negative bacteria. Using Pseudomonas syringae inp as an anchoring motif, we investigated the functional display of a foreign protein, Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase (LevU), on the surface of Escherichia coli. The cells expressing Inp-LevU were found to retain both the ice-nucleation and whole-cell levansucrase enzyme activities, indicating the functional expression of Inp-LevU hybrid protein on the cell surface. The surface localization was further verified by immunofluorescence microscopy, fluorescence-activated cell sorting flow cytometry and immunogold electron microscopical examination. No growth inhibition or changes in the outer membrane integrity were observed upon the induction of fusion protein synthesis. Viability of the cells was also maintained over 48 hours in the stationary phase. Surface-displayed levansucrases were found to be resistant to the externally added proteases unless the cells were treated with EDTA. When the levansucrase-displayed cells were used as the enzyme source, levan (44 g/L) was efficiently synthesized from sucrose (130 g/L) with 34% (wt/wt) conversion yield, generating glucose (65 g/L) as a by-product.
TI  - Development of a gene reporter system in moderately halophilic bacteria by employing the ice nucleation gene of Pseudomonas syringae.
AB  - The expression of the ice nucleation gene inaZ of Pseudomonas syringae in several moderate halophiles was investigated to establish its utility as a reporter for promoter activity and gene expression studies in these biotechnologically and environmentally important bacteria. A promoterless version of inaZ was introduced in two different restriction sites and at both orientations in a recombinant plasmid able to replicate in moderate halophiles and, in particular, within the sequence of its pHE1 part, a native plasmid of Halomonas elongata. One orientation of both recombinant constructs expressed high levels of ice nucleation activity in H. elongata and Volcaniella eurihalina cells, indicating that inaZ was probably introduced in the correct orientation downstream of putative native promoters. A recombinant construct carrying a tandem duplication of inaZ at the same orientation gave significantly higher ice nucleation activity, showing that inaZ is appropriate for gene dosage studies. The ice nucleation gene was also expressed in H. elongata and V. eurihalina under the control of Pbla (the promoter of the beta-lactamase gene of Escherichia coli) and Ppdc (the promoter of the pyruvate decarboxylase gene of Zymomonas mobilis). One of the inaZ reporter plasmids expressing high levels of ice nucleation activity under the control of a native putative promoter was also transferred in Halomonas subglaciescola, Halomonas meridiana, Halomonas halodurans, and Deleya halophila. In all cases, Ice+ transconjugants were successfully isolated, demonstrating that inaZ is expressed in a wide spectrum of moderately halophilic species.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an extracellular levansucrase from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola.
AB  - Levansucrase (EC 2.4.1.10), an exoenzyme of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, was purified to homogeneity from the cell supernatant by chromatography on TMAE-Fraktogel and butyl-Fraktogel. The enzyme has molecular masses of 45 kDa under denaturing conditions and 68 kDa during gel filtration of the native form. In isoelectric focusing, active bands appeared at pH 3.55 and 3.6. Maximum sucrose cleaving activities were measured at pH 5.8 to 6.6 and 60 degrees C. The enzyme was highly tolerant to denaturing agents, proteases, and repeated freezing and thawing. The molecular weight of the produced levan depended on temperature, salinity, and sucrose concentration. The enzyme had levan-degrading activity and did not accept raffinose as a substrate. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence with the predicted amino acid sequence of levansucrases from Erwinia amylovora and Zymomonas mobilis showed 88 and 69% similarity, respectively, in amino acids 5 to 20. No similarity could be detected to levansucrases of gram-positive bacteria in the first 20 amino acids. By comparison of all levansucrases which have been sequenced to date, the enzyme seems to be conserved in the gram-negative bacteria. The rheological behavior of the product levan prompted a new assessment of the enzyme's role in pathogenesis. Depending on formation conditions, levan solutions exclude other polymer solutions. This behavior supports the presumption that the levansucrase is important in the early phase of infection by creating a separating layer between bacteria and plant cell wall to prevent the pathogen from recognition.
TI  - The Ice Nucleation Gene from Pseudomonas syringae as a Sensitive Gene Reporter for Promoter Analysis in Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The expression of the ice nucleation gene inaZ from Pseudomonas syringae in Zymomonas mobilis strains under the control of three different promoters was investigated to establish the utility of the gene as a reporter and examine the possible use of the organism as a source of ice nuclei for biotechnological applications. A promoterless version of the inaZ gene was placed under the control of three different promoters: P(infpdc) (pyruvate decarboxylase), a homologous strong promoter from Z. mobilis; P(infbla) ((beta)-lactamase) of plasmid pBR325; and P(infhrpR), the promoter of hrpR, a regulatory gene from P. syringae pv. phaseolicola. The apparent strengths of all three promoters, measured by quantifying the ice nucleation activity at -9 deg C, were lower in Z. mobilis than in Escherichia coli. The levels of ice nucleation activity expressed under the P(infpdc) promoter were significantly higher than those obtained with the two heterologous promoters in Z. mobilis. Plasmid pCG4521 (RK2 replicon) gave much lower levels of ice nucleation activity when propagated in strain uvs-51, a plasmid instability mutant of Z. mobilis, compared with the wild-type strain. The ice nucleation activity in Z. mobilis cultures showed unusual partitioning in that the culture supernatants obtained after low-speed centrifugation contained the majority of ice nuclei. Analysis of the ice nucleation spectra revealed that the cell pellets contained both "warm" and "cold" nuclei, while the culture supernatant contained primarily cold nuclei, suggesting that the cold nucleus activity may be extracellular. However, all nucleation activity was retained by 0.22-(mu)m-pore-size filters.
TI  - Distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  - Mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in January, April, July, and October from 1984 to 1989. Unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the Jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. Of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. From the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forPseudomonas syringae, followed byXanthomonas campestris (6.7%),Erwinia herbicola (6%),Acetobacter aceti (4.7%),Gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),Pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),Bacillus megaterium (3.8%),Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),Lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),Curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),Micrococcus luteus (2.2%),Arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),Klebsiella planticola (1.2%),Streptococcus faecium (1.2%),Clavibacter sp. (0.98%),Micrococcus sp. (0.82%),Serratia marcescens (0.81%),Bacillus subtilis (0.57%),Cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),Erwinia sp. (0.37%),Zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),Bacillus sp. (0.29%),Alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),Erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andPseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). Bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. Communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. The communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.
