TI  == severity of atopic disease inversely correlates with intestinal microbiota diversity and butyrate-producing bacteria.
AB  == the reports on atopic diseases and microbiota in early childhood remain contradictory, and both decreased and increased microbiota diversity have been associated with atopic eczema. in this study, the intestinal microbiota signatures associated with the severity of eczema in 6-month-old infants were characterized. further, the changes in intestinal microbiota composition related  to the improvement of this disease 3 months later were assessed. the severity of  eczema correlated inversely with microbiota diversity (r = -0.54, p = 0.002) and  with the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (r = -0.52, p = 0.005). during  the 3-month follow-up, microbiota diversity increased (p < 0.001) and scoring atopic dermatitis values decreased (p < 0.001) in all infants. this decrease coincided with the increase in bacteria related to butyrate-producing coprococcus eutactus (r = -0.59, p = 0.02). in conclusion, the high diversity of microbiota and high abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria were associated with milder eczema, thus suggesting they have a role in alleviating symptoms of atopic eczema.
