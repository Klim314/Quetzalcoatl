TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == validation of sterility testing of cord blood: challenges and results.
AB  == background: sterility testing for cord blood (cb) products is mandatory to prevent transplantation-transmitted microbial infections. here, the automated bact/alert (biomerieux) culture system was validated to detect microbial contamination in cb units processed at the canadian national public cord blood bank. study design and methods: a three-phase validation was developed. cb units  were prepared with pentastarch (phases 1 and 2) or hetastarch (phase 3). in phase 1, cb was spiked with approximately 100 colony-forming units/ml of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides fragilis, and candida albicans. plasma (8 ml) and buffy  coat (bc; 0.5 and 8 ml) were inoculated into culture bottles. in phases 2 and 3,  a mix of red blood cells (rbcs) and plasma (4 ml each) was used as the inoculant. in phase 3, aspergillus brasiliensis was added as a test organism and microbial concentrations in the by-product rbcs and plasma were determined. the bc fractions were cryopreserved and tested 3 months later. results: in phase 1, bacteria failed to grow in cb units containing antibiotics. thus, antibiotic-free units were used for the other phases. c. albicans was not always captured in plasma, but using a mix of rbcs and plasma, all organisms were detected. the use  of pentastarch or hetastarch did not affect microbial recovery. c. albicans and a. brasiliensis were preferentially recovered in rbcs and bc. cryopreservation did not affect microbial survival during cb processing. conclusions: a mix of plasma and rbcs is appropriate for cb sterility testing. interestingly, fungi preferentially segregate to cellular fractions. the clinical significance of the  bactericidal /or bacteriostatic effect of antibiotics in cb merits further investigation.

TI  == microbiology of pelvic lymphocyst infection after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors.
AB  == background: pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. the purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. methods: this was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between october 2002 and march 2013. the participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. results: during the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors,  and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. cultures identified staphylococcus aureus (three patients), s. epidermidis (one patient), streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), enterococcus (two patients), escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). they were all monomicrobial infections. conclusions: our study and other smaller ones  suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and anaerobes such as  bacteroides fragilis. these bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == biofilm removal and antimicrobial activity of two different air-polishing powders: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: biofilm removal plays a central role in the prevention of periodontal and peri-implant diseases associated with microbial infections. plaque debridement may be accomplished by air polishing using abrasive powders. in this  study, a new formulation consisting of erythritol and chlorhexidine is compared with the standard glycine powder used in air-polishing devices. their in vitro antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects on staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and candida albicans are investigated. methods: biofilm was allowed to  grow on sandblasted titanium disks and air polished with glycine or erythritol-chlorhexidine powders. a semiquantitative analysis of biofilm by spectrophotometric assay was performed. a qualitative analysis was also carried out by confocal laser scanning microscopy. minimum inhibitory concentrations and  minimum microbicidal concentrations were evaluated, together with the microbial recovery from the residual biofilm after air-polishing treatment. results: the combination of erythritol and chlorhexidine displayed stronger antimicrobial and  antibiofilm activity than glycine against all microbial strains tested. conclusion: air polishing with erythritol-chlorhexidine seems to be a viable alternative to the traditional glycine treatment for biofilm removal.

TI  == distinct cytokine pattern in response to different bacterial pathogens in human brain abscess.
AB  == brain abscess is a focal suppurative process. host inflammatory response in gram  type and specific bacteria has not been studied in brain abscess. a total of 57 brain abscess patients with monomicrobial infections were studied for th1 (tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, il1-beta), th2 (il-4, il-10) and th17 (il-17, il-23) cytokine response by reverse-transcriptase pcr and elisa. th1 and th17 cytokines  were significantly elevated in gram positive (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus intermedius) and th2 cytokine (il-10) in gram negative (bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli) infections (p<0.05). cytokine levels were significantly higher in abscess than blood (p<0.001). elevated levels of several  inflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, il1-beta, il-17 and il-23) were associated with the duration of symptoms; predisposing factors also influenced the levels of several cytokines. the expression of inflammatory cytokines in abscess was influenced by the bacterial pathogen, duration of symptoms and predisposing factors. local milieu of brain plays significant role in secretion of various cytokines.

TI  == distinct polymicrobial populations in a chronic foot ulcer with implications for  diagnostics and anti-infective therapy.
AB  == background: polymicrobial infections caused by combinations of different bacteria are being detected with an increasing frequency. the evidence of such complex infections is being revealed through the use of novel molecular and culture-independent methods. considerable progress has been made in the last decade regarding the diagnostic application of such molecular techniques. in particular, 16s rdna-based sequencing and even metagenomic analyses have been successfully used to study the microbial diversity in ecosystems and human microbiota. here, we utilized denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) as a diagnostic tool for identifying different bacterial species in complex clinical samples of a patient with a chronic foot ulcer. case presentation: a 45-year-old female suffered from a chronic 5x5cm large plantar ulcer located in the posterior calcaneal area with subcutaneous tissue infection  and osteomyelitis. the chronic ulcer developed over a period of 8 years. culture  and dhplc revealed a distinct and location-dependent polymicrobial infection of the ulcer. the analysis of a superficial biopsy revealed a mixture of staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, and fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas the tissue-deep biopsy harbored a mixture of four different bacterial species, namely gemella morbillorum, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides fragilis, and arcanobacterium haemolyticum. conclusions: this clinical case highlights the difficulties in assessing polymicrobial infections where a mixture of fastidious, rapid and slow growing bacteria as well as anaerobes exists as structured communities within the tissue architecture of chronic wound infections. the diagnosis of this multilayered polymicrobial infection led to a microbe-adapted antibiotic therapy, targeting the polymicrobial nature of this infection in addition to a standard local wound treatment. however, a complete wound closure could not be achieved due to the long-lasting extensive destruction of tissue.

TI  == intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  == study design: retrospective case series. objective: to demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. summary of background data: prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site  infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. methods: a single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. results: a total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from january 2011 to june 2013. the average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with  a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was staphylococcus  aureus. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. a number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. conclusion: prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. the use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == arda proteins from different mobile genetic elements can bind to the ecoki type i dna methyltransferase of e. coli k12.
AB  == anti-restriction and anti-modification (anti-rm) is the ability to prevent cleavage by dna restriction-modification (rm) systems of foreign dna entering a new bacterial host. the evolutionary consequence of anti-rm is the enhanced dissemination of mobile genetic elements. homologues of arda anti-rm proteins are encoded by genes present in many mobile genetic elements such as conjugative plasmids and transposons within bacterial genomes. the arda proteins cause anti-rm by mimicking the dna structure bound by type i rm enzymes. we have investigated arda proteins from the genomes of enterococcus faecalis v583, staphylococcus aureus mu50 and bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343, and compared them  to the arda protein expressed by the conjugative transposon tn916. we find that despite having very different structural stability and secondary structure content, they can all bind to the ecoki methyltransferase, a core component of the ecoki type i rm system. this finding indicates that the less structured arda  proteins become fully folded upon binding. the ability of arda from diverse mobile elements to inhibit type i rm systems from other bacteria suggests that they are an advantage for transfer not only between closely-related bacteria but  also between more distantly related bacterial species.

TI  == ceftaroline plus avibactam demonstrates bactericidal activity against pathogenic  anaerobic bacteria in a one-compartment in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  model.
AB  == anaerobic pathogens are often associated with polymicrobial infections, such as diabetic foot infections. patients with these infections are often treated with broad-spectrum, multidrug therapies targeting resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, as well as gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes. the broad-spectrum, non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam has been combined with ceftaroline and may provide a single-product alternative for complicated polymicrobial infections. we compared  the activity of ceftaroline-avibactam (cpa) to that of ertapenem (ert) against common anaerobic pathogens in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) model. simulations of doses of ceftaroline-fosamil at 600 mg every 8 h (q8h) (maximum free drug concentration [fcmax], 17.04 mg/liter, and half-life [t1/2], 2.66 h) plus avibactam at 600 mg q8h (fcmax, 11.72 mg/liter, and t1/2, 1.8 h) and of ertapenem at 1 g q24h (fcmax, 13 mg/liter, and t1/2, 4 h) were evaluated against two strains of bacteroides fragilis, one strain of prevotella bivia, and  one strain of finegoldia magna in an anaerobic one-compartment in vitro pk/pd model over 72 h with a starting inoculum of approximately 8 log10 cfu/ml. bactericidal activity was defined as a reduction of >/=3 log10 cfu/ml from the starting inoculum. both cpa and ert were bactericidal against all four strains. cpa demonstrated improved activity against bacteroides strains compared to that of ert but had similar activity against finegoldia magna and p. bivia, although modest regrowth was observed with cpa against p. bivia. no resistance emerged from any of the models. the pharmacokinetics achieved were 92 to 105% of the targets. cpa has potent in vitro activity against common anaerobic pathogens at clinically relevant drug exposures and may be a suitable single product for the management of complicated polymicrobial infections.

TI  == growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == background: the growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria  were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. method: a microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate  the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the test materials against the organisms. results: delta-3-carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of gram-positive bacteria (clostridium difficile atcc 9689, clostridium paraputrificum atcc 25780, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 11775 and bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), 0.18-0.70 mg/ml) except for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 13311 (mic, 2.94 mg/ml). the mic of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/ml against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against c. difficile (0.70 mg/ml); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/ml) and 4 (5.80 mg/ml) against c. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/ml), 4 (12.0 mg/ml), and 7 (0.70 mg/ml) against c. perfringens); compound 1 against e. coli (7.20 mg/ml) and s. enterica serovar typhimurium (12.0 mg/ml). overall, all of the constituents were  less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (mic, 0.063-0.25 mg/ ml). the lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium clostridium butyricum atcc 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (b. fragilis and e. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. beneficial gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria was not observed. scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. conclusion: a. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == in vivo efficacy of humanized ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam exposures in a polymicrobial infection model.
AB  == although gram-positive cocci are the most common pathogens in diabetic foot infections, these infections often are polymicrobial. the objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a simulated human dose of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion in a polymicrobial in vivo murine model. seven isolates were used (3 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa] isolates, 1 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa] isolate, 1 escherichia coli isolate, 1 enterobacter cloacae isolate, and 1 bacteroides fragilis isolate) in various combinations in an immunocompromised polymicrobial tissue infection to assess the efficacy of the simulated regimen. each infection  was comprised of at least one s. aureus isolate with a mic of 0.25 to 1 mug/ml and one enterobacteriaceae isolate with a mic of 1 or 4 mug/ml. eight of 16 infections also included b. fragilis, with a mic of 0.5 mug/ml, as a third organism. efficacy was evaluated after 24 h as the change in log10 cfu from the level of 0-h controls. efficacy was seen against all isolate combinations, with at least a 1-log kill against enterobacteriaceae and a minimum of a 2-log kill against s. aureus and b. fragilis isolates. these bacterial reductions correlate  with free drug concentration above the mic (ft>mic) produced by the humanized regimen of 100, 86, and 56% at mics of 1, 2, and 4 mug/ml, respectively. the humanized regimen of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion showed predictable efficacy against all infections tested in this model. these data support further clinical investigation of ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam for the treatment of polymicrobial tissue infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == human colonic mucus is a reservoir for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == background and aims: to prevent bacterial adherence and translocation, the colonic mucosa is covered by a protecting mucus layer and the epithelium synthesizes antimicrobial peptides. the present qualitative study investigated the contents and interaction of these peptides in and with rectal mucus. methods: rectal mucus extracts were analyzed for antimicrobial activity and screened with  matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, dot blot and immunohistochemistry for antimicrobial peptides. in addition, binding of amps to mucins was investigated by western blot and enzyme-linked lectin assays.  results: in functional tests the mucus layer exhibited a strong antimicrobial activity. we detected 11 antimicrobial peptides in mucus extracts from healthy persons including the defensins hbd-1 and -3, the cathelicidin ll-37, ubiquitin,  lysozyme, histones, high mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing protein 2, ubiquicidin and other ribosomal proteins. amps were bound by mucins but this was demonstrated to be reversible and inhibition of antibacterial activity was limited. conclusion: these findings indicate that epithelial antimicrobial peptides are retained in the intestinal mucus layer without losing  their efficacy. thus, the mucus layer and its composition provide an attractive drug target to restore antimicrobial barrier function in intestinal diseases.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ceftaroline, ceftaroline-avibactam, and other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria cultured from infected diabetic foot wounds.
AB  == foot infections are the most common infectious complication of diabetes. moderate to severe diabetic foot infections (dfi) are typically polymicrobial with both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. the role of mrsa in these wounds has become an increasing concern. to determine if the addition of avibactam, a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor, to ceftaroline would be more active than ceftaroline alone, we tested 316 aerobic pathogens and 154 anaerobic recovered from patients with moderate to severe dfi, and compared ceftaroline with and without avibactam to other agents. testing on aerobes was done by broth  microdilution and by agar dilution for anaerobes, according to clsi m11-a8, and m7-a8 standards. ceftaroline-avibactam mic90 for all staphylococcus spp. including mrsa was 0.5 mug/ml, and for enterococci was 1 mug/ml. the mic90s for enteric gram-negative rods was 0.125 mug/ml. the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline reduced the ceftaroline mics for 2 strains of resistant enterobacter  spp. and for 1 strain of morganella. against anaerobic gram-positive cocci ceftaroline-avibactam had an mic90 0.125 mug/ml and for clostridia 1 mug/ml. avibactam improved ceftaroline's mic90s for bacteroides fragilis from >32 to 2 mug/ml and for prevotella spp. from >32 to 1 mug/ml. ceftaroline alone demonstrates excellent in vitro activity against most of the aerobes found in moderate to severe dfi. the addition of avibactam provides an increased spectrum  of activity including the beta-lactamase producing prevotella, bacteroides fragilis and ceftaroline resistant gram-negative enteric organisms.

AB  == the immune system is essential to maintain homeostasis with resident microbial populations, ensuring that the symbiotic host-microbial relationship is maintained. in parallel, commensal microbes significantly shape mammalian immunity at the host mucosal surface, as well as systemically. candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that lives as a commensal on skin and mucosa of healthy individuals. little is known about its capacity to modulate responses toward other microorganisms, such as colonizing bacteria (e.g., intestinal microorganisms). the aim of this study was to assess the cytokine production of pbmcs induced by commensal bacteria when these cells were primed by c. albicans.  we show that c. albicans and beta-1,3-glucan induce priming of human primary mononuclear cells and this leads to enhanced cytokine production upon in vitro stimulation with tlr ligands and bacterial commensals. this priming requires the  beta-1,3-glucan receptor dectin-1 and the noncanonical raf-1 pathway. in addition, although purified mannans cannot solely mediate the priming, the presence of mannosyl residues in the cell wall of c. albicans is nevertheless required. in conclusion, c. albicans is able to modify cytokine responses to tlr  ligands and colonizing bacteria, which is likely to impact the inflammatory reaction during mucosal diseases.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == pharmacodynamic modelling of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.
AB  == surgical-site infections are the leading cause of post-operative morbidity and mortality as well as increased costs following colorectal surgery. the purpose of this study was to evaluate different beta-lactam antimicrobial dosing regimens currently used for prophylaxis in elective colorectal procedures with the aim of  identifying optimal antibiotics and dosing regimens. serum pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters specific to each drug for use in pharmacodynamic (pd) modelling were obtained from the published literature. susceptibility data for escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus for use in modelling simulations were obtained from the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast). monte carlo simulation was used to evaluate the influence of dose and dosing frequency of tested antibiotics to achieve a prophylaxis target ft>mic (time during which the free drug concentration exceeds the pathogen minimum inhibitory concentration) of 100% for up to 4h. ertapenem 1g, cefuroxime 1.5 g and cefazolin 2 g were the only antibiotic regimens that consistently yielded target ft>mic of 100% for the entire 4-h post-dose interval and against all targeted organisms more than 90% of the time. in contrast, cefoxitin, cefotetan and ampicillin/sulbactam yielded very poor predicted pk/pd performances. in conclusion, this study demonstrates the value of, and need for, applied pd research in the area of surgical prophylaxis. whether cefoxitin, cefotetan or ampicillin/sulbactam should continue to be advocated as first-line agents for prophylaxis during elective colorectal surgery, particularly at the standard doses currently being used, is debatable.

TI  == microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  == sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (ssi). the present investigation characterized microbial  recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (ab) and nonabsorbable (nab) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. ab and nab sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. at explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (sem). bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. a significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (p < 0.05) was noted. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected  devices. no significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (p < 0.042). we  conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface  for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from  infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and  (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from surgical site infections (ssi) in japan.
AB  == to investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from  surgical site infections (ssi), a japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey. seven main organisms were collected from ssi at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. a total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with ssi were included. staphylococcus aureus (20.4 %) and enterococcus faecalis  (19.5 %) were the most common isolates, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4  %) and bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 %). methicillin-resistant s. aureus among s. aureus was 72.0 %. vancomycin mic 2 mug/ml strains accounted for 9.7 %. in escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). of e. coli strains, 8.4 % were resistant to ceftazidime (caz) and 26.3 % to ciprofloxacin (cpfx). no p. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-beta-lactamase. in p. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4  % to tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), 10.2 % to imipenem (ipm), 2.8 % to meropenem, cefepime, and cpfx, and 0 % to gentamicin. in the b. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 % to clindamycin, 5.7 % to cefmetazole, 2.9 % to taz/pipc and ipm, and 0 % to metronidazole (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0  %). mic(9)(0) of p. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in taz/pipc, caz, ipm, and cpfx. in patients with american society of anesthesiologists (asa) score >/=3, the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa to taz/pipc and caz were higher than in patients with asa </=2. the data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause ssi. timing of isolation from surgery and the patient's physical status affected the selection of resistant organisms.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == the effect of environmental conditions on expression of bacteroides fragilis and  bacteroides thetaiotaomicron c10 protease genes.
AB  == background: bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are members of  the normal human intestinal microbiota. however, both organisms are capable of causing opportunistic infections, during which the environmental conditions to which the bacteria are exposed change dramatically. to further explore their potential for contributing to infection, we have characterized the expression in  b. thetaiotaomicron of four homologues of the gene encoding the c10 cysteine protease speb, a potent extracellular virulence factor produced by streptococcus  pyogenes. results: we identified a paralogous set of genes (btp genes) in the b.  thetaiotaomicron genome, that were related to c10 protease genes we recently identified in b. fragilis. similar to c10 proteases found in b. fragilis, three of the b. thetaiotaomicron homologues were transcriptionally coupled to genes encoding small proteins that are similar in structural architecture to staphostatins, protease inhibitors associated with staphopains in staphylococcus  aureus. the expression of genes for these c10 proteases in both b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron was found to be regulated by environmental stimuli, in particular by exposure to oxygen, which may be important for their contribution to the development of opportunistic infections. conclusions: genes encoding c10 proteases are increasingly identified in operons which also contain genes encoding proteins homologous to protease inhibitors. the bacteroides c10 protease gene expression levels are responsive to different environmental stimuli suggesting they may have distinct roles in the bacterial-host interaction.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the us food and  drug administration (fda) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). after intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. because of its unique spectrum of activity, the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-mrsa activity. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. ceftaroline has low  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for all tested species of streptococci,  and has potent activity against s. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. the activity of ceftaroline is limited against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. the in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class b metallo-beta-lactamases or ampc cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline  fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in phase iii randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. two identical trials (canvas 1 and canvas 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with csssi. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam  group (difference -1.1%, 95% ci -4.2, 2.0). an additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the fda guidance definition of absssi at treatment day 3. clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared  with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% ci 1.3, 14.0). clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with cap was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase iii trials (focus 1 and focus 2). of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against mrsa, patients with confirmed or suspected mrsa cap were excluded from the focus trials. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure  compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% ci 1.6, 11.8). an additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe cap and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. cabp). day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% ci -0.6, 20.6). in the phase iii trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens, including mrsa, as well as many common gram-negative organisms. it is a welcome treatment option for absssi and cabp.

TI  == therapeutic equivalence requires pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic identities: true bioequivalence of a generic product of intravenous metronidazole.
AB  == animal models of infection have been used to demonstrate the therapeutic failure  of "bioequivalent" generic products, but their applicability for this purpose requires the accurate identification of those products that are truly bioequivalent. here, we present data comparing one intravenous generic product of metronidazole with the innovator product in a neutropenic mouse thigh anaerobic infection model. simultaneous experiments allowed comparisons (generic versus innovator) of potency and the concentration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (api), analytical chemistry (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry [lc/ms]), in vitro susceptibility testing, single-dose serum pharmacokinetics (pk) in infected mice, and in vivo pharmacodynamics (pd) against bacteroides fragilis atcc 25825 in synergy with escherichia coli sig-1 in the neutropenic mouse thigh anaerobic infection model. the hill dose-response model followed by curve-fitting analysis was used to calculate and compare primary and secondary pd parameters. the generic and the innovator products were identical in terms of the concentration and potency of the api, chromatographic and spectrographic profiles, mic and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) (2.0 mg/liter), and mouse pk. we found no differences between products in bacteriostatic doses (bd) (15 to 22 mg/kg of body weight per day) or the doses needed to kill 1 log (1lkd)  (21 to 29 mg/kg per day) or 2 logs (2lkd) (28 to 54 mg/kg per day) of b. fragilis under dosing schedules of every 12 h (q12h), q8h, or q6h. the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the mic (auc/mic ratio) was the best pd index to predict the antibacterial efficacy of metronidazole (adjusted coefficient of determination [adjr(2)] = 84.6%), and its  magnitude to reach bacteriostasis in vivo (56.6 +/- 5.17 h) or to kill the first  (90.8 +/- 9.78 h) and second (155.5 +/- 22.2 h) logs was the same for both products. animal models of infection allow a thorough demonstration of the therapeutic equivalence of generic antimicrobials.

(2) mepm maintained potent and stable antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the proportion of mepm-resistant strains to ciprofloxacin-resistant strains or imipenem-resistant strains were 53.1% and 58.0% respectively. (3) the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (26 strains) in enterobacteriaceae. and the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 2.0% (6 strains) in p. aeruginosa. (4) of all  species tested, there were no species except for bacteroides fragilis group, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical  isolates to meropenem. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem for serious infections treatment at present, 14 years passed after available for commercial use in japan.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated  from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated  at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 micrcog/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, vcm, teicoplanin, linezolid(lzd) and qpr/dpr had mic90s of < or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of e. faecalis strains or 3.5% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to lzd. 24.4% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr. against  all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm were under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity against c. difficile. carbapenems showed good activity against peptococcaceae, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp. however since several strains of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the  future.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (dfi). the trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in dfi, including gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic  bacteria with 95% of mics < or =2 microg/ml for the entire collection. the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for dfi, such as staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis. as reported previously, pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. the excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum  activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility  of tigecycline for pathogens associated with dfis.

TI  == intra-abdominal infections: etiology, epidemiology, microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == intra-abdominal infections (iais) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  the etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable  and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired iais enterobacteria predominate (mostly escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly bacteroides fragilis). in nosocomial iais, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and candida spp. diagnostic microbiology of iais is complex and plays a relevant role, especially in some situations (e.g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing iais. resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.

TI  == infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

TI  == doripenem.
AB  == carbapenems play a significant role in the current antibiotic armamentarium. doripenem is the newest carbapenem to be commercially released. its antimicrobial spectrum more closely resembles those of meropenem and imipenem than that of ertapenem. thus, it has significant in vitro activity against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae (including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, and bacteroides fragilis. doripenem does not have clinically useful activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and the majority of gram-negative bacilli that  are resistant to meropenem or imipenem. in vitro, resistant p. aeruginosa mutants appear to be harder to select with doripenem than with other carbapenems. doripenem has been approved for use in treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection. studies of hospital-acquired pneumonia have also been completed, including one that used a 4-h infusion to enhance the pharmacodynamic profile. in vitro, doripenem lacks the propensity to  cause seizures, and a low risk of seizures has been demonstrated in clinical studies. currently unanswered questions regarding doripenem include the utility and dosing in neonatal, pediatric, and cystic fibrosis populations and specific dosage recommendations for patients receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis,  or continuous renal replacement therapies. the longevity of doripenem will depend on our ability to curtail the spread of carbapenem-resistant organisms, which are already a significant problem at some institutions.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

AB  == background/aims: risk factors for mortality resulting from anaerobic infection are incompletely defined. the clinical significance of a broad range of pathogenic obligate anaerobic organisms was examined, and factors independently associated with mortality were identified in patients with clinically significant anaerobic infections. methods: the medical records of 1,050 patients with anaerobic infections were retrospectively reviewed at severance hospital in seoul, korea. results: the mean age of the patients was 54.1+/-16.8 years, and 57.7% were men. overall, 320 (30.5%) patients with case-defined illness experienced pain at the affected site, and 230 (21.9%) experienced pus flow from  lesions. ten (1.4%) patients presented with shock, and 80.3% of the clinically significant cases were polymicrobial anaerobic infections. the mean number of pathogens, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, was 3.7+/-1.0 (minimum 1, maximum 5), and the number of anaerobic organisms was 1.0+/-0.3 in each specimen. the major pathogens by rank were the bacteroides fragilis group, which accounted  for 41.8% of anaerobic infections, followed by clostridium spp. (11.8%), prevotella spp. (9.4%), and peptostreptococcus spp. (8.4%). escherichia coli (17.5%), staphylococcus aureus (7.5%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%) were common concomitant aerobic organisms. the overall crude mortality rate resulting  from anaerobic infection was 29.7%. among the determining factors associated with mortality, liver disease (p=0.003) and old age (p=0.005) were significant in multivariate analysis. conclusions: anaerobic infection is polymicrobial and has  a significant role in morbidity and mortality. underlying liver disease was associated with poor prognosis in anaerobic infection.

TI  == management of severe abdominal infections.
AB  == abdominal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. nearly all bacteria causing abdominal infections are derived from the endogenous  flora of the alimentary tract. the resulting infection is typically polymicrobial and comprised of both aerobic and anaerobic microbes. they can be classified by their severity as uncomplicated and complicated or by their origin as community or hospital acquired. escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis are the most frequently isolated bacteria in community-acquired abdominal infections. nosocomial infections typically involve a more resistant flora (e.g. pseudomonas  spp., acinetobacter spp., gram-negative bacilli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases [esbl], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [vre] and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa]). antimicrobial therapy should be guided by microbiological testing and frequently requires other interventions  as well. in uncomplicated infections antimicrobial prophylaxis for < 24h may be considered. patients with underlying or acquired immunodeficiency, i.e. organ transplant recipients and other patients on complex immunosuppressant regimens require special attention and antimicrobial coverage. we discuss the relevant microbiota, a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach including strategies to handle challenging infections. the application of novel compounds and/or drug  classes for abdominal infections such as glycylcyclines (i.e. tigecycline), glycopeptides (i.e. dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin), carbapenems (i.e. doripenem), and forth generation cephalosporins (i.e. ceftaroline, ceftobiprole)  as well as patents on metalloproteinase and caspase inhibitors, interleukin antagonists, fusion proteins and nitric oxide donators is critically reviewed. the information is summarized in flow charts and algorithms for use in daily clinical practice and the review article also shows the useful information of the patents for the treatment of abdominal infections.

TI  == review of the guidelines for complicated skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections--are they applicable today?
AB  == difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (ciais), are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, and carry an economic burden. these surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial infections caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative strains. optimal management of sstis and ciais must take into account the presence of resistant pathogens, and depends on the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e. the correct spectrum, route and dose in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration as well as the timely implementation of source control measures). treatment recommendations from the infectious diseases society of america and the surgical  infection society are available for guidance in the management of both of these infections, yet the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens  has complicated the antibiotic selection process. several pathogens of concern include methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, responsible for problematic  postoperative infections, especially in patients with sstis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria, including ctx-m-type-producing escherichia coli strains, and multidrug-resistant strains of bacteroides fragilis. new empirical regimens, taking advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options, may be needed for the treatment of certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.

AB  == ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase iii clinical development. ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and meticillin-resistant s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, gram-negative bacilli including ampc-producing escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. in single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for ampc beta-lactamases.ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30  minutes. peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/ml for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/ml for  a 750-mg dose. the volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 l/kg ( approximately 18 l), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in  the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (pae) of approximately 0.5 hours for mrsa and a longer pae of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f t(>mic) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole mic < or =4 and < or =2 mg/l, respectively.currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. in a phase iii trial, 784 patients with gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for mrsa infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared  with 90% for vancomycin. a phase iii, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. no difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. microbiologic eradication of gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) [ceftobiprole 91% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and mrsa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as gram-negative bacilli, e. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and p. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl)-positive mssa and pvl-positive mrsa.currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase iii trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to mrsa and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven mrsa; phase iii trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety  profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. the broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole  and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == assessment of antimicrobial microspheres as a prospective novel treatment targeted towards the repair of perianal fistulae.
AB  == background: none of the proposed materials tested for the management of perianal  fistulae has proven to be a definitive treatment. aim: to assess a new repair scaffold and drug delivery device conceived to target perianal fistula repair. methods: poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) porous microspheres containing either antibacterial silver-releasing degradable phosphate glass or metronidazole were prepared using thermally induced phase separation. results: ion- and drug-release profiling of the microspheres revealed continued release of silver ions from microspheres filled with silver-doped phosphate glass and high encapsulation efficiency for metronidazole [78% and 82% for microspheres loaded with 2.5% and 1.3% (w/w), respectively]. microbicidal activity was confirmed by growth inhibition of bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis), which characteristically dominate the colonization of perianal fistula tracts. microspheres containing >3 mol% silver or metronidazole  resulted in strong bacterial inhibition/kill against b. fragilis; the presence of one sphere containing >3 mol% silver had a potent inhibitory effect against all the microbes studied. microspheres became rapidly integrated with host tissue following subcutaneous implantation into a rodent wound model. conclusion: the study demonstrates a novel scaffold for guided tissue regeneration providing local release of antimicrobial agents sufficient to counter bacterial colonization and warrants further investigation.

TI  == studies of photokilling of bacteria using titanium dioxide nanoparticles.
AB  == metal pins used to apply skeletal traction or external fixation devices protruding through skin are susceptible to the increased incidence of pin site infection. in this work, we tried to establish the photokilling effects of titanium dioxide (tio2) nanoparticles on an orthopedic implant with an in vitro study. in these photocatalytic experiments, aqueous tio2 was added to the tested  microorganism. the time effect of tio2 photoactivation was evaluated, and the loss of viability of five different bacteria suspensions (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae, and bacteroides fragilis) was examined by the viable count procedure. the bactericidal effect of tio2 nanoparticle-coated metal plates was also tested. the ultraviolet (uv) dosage used in this experiment did not affect the viability of bacteria, and all bacteria survived well in the absence of tio2 nanoparticles. the survival curve of microorganisms in the presence of tio2 nanoparticles showed that nearly complete killing was achieved after 50 min of uv illumination. the formation of bacterial colonies above the tio2 nanoparticle-coated metal plates also decreased significantly. in this study, we clearly demonstrated the bactericidal effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. in the presence of uv light, the titanium dioxide nanoparticles can be applicable to medical facilities where the potential for infection should be controlled.

TI  == [abscess of the posterior cranial fossa. report of 4 cases].
AB  == the posterior cerebral fossa is an uncommon location for cerebral abscess. in most cases diagnosis is made at the encapsulation stage with the risk of life-threatening tonsillar herniation. the purpose of this retrospective study was to describe our experience in the management of four cases of abscess located in the posterior cerebral fossa between january 2000 and december 2004. all patients benefited from clinical examination and radiological study (ct-scan). surgical treatment performed in all cases consisted of trepano-puncture of the abscess. the minimum duration of post-operative follow-up was 6 months. mean patient age was 38.75 years. all patients presented infectious syndrome and intracranial hypertension. the male:female sex ratio was 3:1. a history of chronic middle ear otitis was noted in two patients. diagnosis of abscess in the  posterior cerebral fossa was confirmed by ct-scan in 2 cases. cholesteatoma and triventricular hydrocephaly were noted in 2 cases. all patients benefited from trepano-puncture of the abscess. bacteriologic study of pus was positive for staphylococcus aureus in 1 case, and providencia sp associated with bacteroides fragilis in another. second-stage radical mastoidectomy was performed in 2 cases. one patient died. the outcome was favorable in 3 cases. because of the small size of the posterior cerebral fossa, abscess in that location requires emergency treatment. delay can be life-threatening due to the risk of obstructive hydrocephaly and tonsillar herniation.

TI  == determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of four medicaments used as intracanal medication.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of iodoform, calcium hydroxide, iki (iodine potassium iodine) and cfc (ciprofloxacin, flagyl (metronidazole) and calcium hydroxide) required to kill s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and b. fragilis. in the experiment, medicaments were added to bacterial species into test tubes, in 10 different concentrations. the mic was the lowest concentration of the drug at which bacterial growth could not be observed. in this investigation, cfc was the  most effective medicament against all bacteria. all drugs were able to eliminate  e. faecalis and b. fragilis, while iki was not effective against s. aureus. iki and calcium hydroxide were not able to eliminate p. aeruginosa as well.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == pouch of douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) and 20 healthy  women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. a total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. of 37 positive cultures  21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (iucd) implantation. the predominant aerobic isolates were escherichia coli, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons), staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus spp. our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus for optimum therapy of acute pid it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute pid and have affected the choice of therapy.

TI  == bacteriology of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections and in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == as part of a united states-based multicenter clinical trial, conducted from 2001  to 2004, that compared ertapenem to piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of  moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections (dfis), we obtained 454 pretreatment  specimens from 433 patients. after debridement, the investigators collected wound specimens, mostly by curettage or biopsy, and sent them to the r. m. alden research laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture. among the 427 positive cultures, 83.8% were polymicrobial, 48% grew only aerobes, 43.7% had both aerobes and anaerobes, and 1.3% had only anaerobes. cultures yielded a total of 1,145 aerobic strains and 462 anaerobic strains, with an average of 2.7 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 8) for aerobes and 2.3 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 9) for anaerobes. the predominant aerobic organisms were oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (4.4%),  coagulase-negative staphylococcus species (15.3%), streptococcus species (15.5%), enterococcus species (13.5%), corynebacterium species (10.1%), members of the family enterobacteriaceae (12.8%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.5%). the predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci (45.2%), prevotella species (13.6%), porphyromonas species (11.3%), and the bacteroides fragilis group (10.2%). pure cultures were noted for 20% of oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cultures, 9.2% of staphylococcus epidermidis cultures, and 2.5% of p. aeruginosa cultures. two or more species of staphylococcus were present in 13.1%  of the patients. ertapenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were each active against >98% of the enteric gram-negative rods, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, and anaerobes. among the fluoroquinolones, 24% of anaerobes, especially the gram-positive cocci, were resistant to moxifloxacin; 27% of the gram-positive aerobes but only 6% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae were resistant to levofloxacin. moderate-to-severe dfis are typically polymicrobial, and almost half include anaerobes. our antibiotic susceptibility results can help to inform therapeutic choices.

TI  == infections related to coils used for embolization of arteries: review of the published evidence.
AB  == the embolization of arteries with the use of coils has been an advance in the management of patients such as those at risk for aneurysm rupture. however, this  procedure is not without complications. a systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the available evidence regarding infectious complications directly related to endovascular coil embolization. seven case reports of patients who experienced infection related to coils used for embolization of arteries were discovered. arteries embolized with coils in these patients were intracranial, intraabdominal, and intrathoracic, respectively, in four, two, and one case. abscess formation in the area of coil placement (n = 6; 85.7%) was the most common infectious complication directly related to endovascular coil embolization. staphylococcus aureus was the predominant isolated pathogen (n = 3; 42.9%). other isolated pathogens included salmonella species type d (n = 1; 14.3%), s. epidermidis (n = 1; 14.3%), escherichia coli (n = 1; 14.3%), and bacteroides fragilis (n = 1; 14.3%). surgical procedures were performed in four of the seven patients described (57.1%), and three patients were treated with only the administration of antimicrobial agents. all reviewed patients were cured. even though it may partially be a result of reporting bias, the scarcity of reports describing infections directly related to endovascular coils despite the increasing number of patients who received this treatment in various parts of the world suggests that infectious complications associated with this foreign endovascular material are very rare. however, the existence of the identified case reports suggests that clinicians should include coil-related infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever after this procedure.

TI  == soluble cd14 and cd83 from human neonatal antigen-presenting cells are inducible  by commensal bacteria and suppress allergen-induced human neonatal th2 differentiation.
AB  == cd14 is expressed on the cell surface of various antigen-presenting cells, and cd83 is a maturation marker for dendritic cells (dc). cd14 and cd83 are also present as soluble proteins, and both have immunoregulatory functions. we examined whether neonatal cord blood monocytes or dc released soluble cd14 (scd14) or scd83 when exposed to the commensal intestinal bacteria clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis. we found that the gram-positive bacteria c. perfringens and s. aureus, but not gram-negative bacteria, induced the release of scd14 from  monocytes. dc, on the other hand, released scd14 in response to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. moreover, the expression of the virulence factor staphylococcal protein a seemed to be important for s. aureus-induced scd14 production from both monocytes and dc. soluble cd83 was released from dc, but not from monocytes, when exposed to both gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria. finally, to investigate whether scd14 or scd83 could modulate neonatal allergen-induced t-cell differentiation, dc were exposed to birch allergen alone or in the presence of scd14 or scd83 and then cocultured with autologous t cells. we demonstrate that scd14 and scd83 inhibited the birch  allergen-induced th2 differentiation by suppressing interleukin 13 production. together, these results suggest that the commensal intestinal flora may be an important stimulus for the developing immune system by inducing the immunoregulatory proteins scd14 and scd83, which may be involved in preventing t-cell sensitization to allergens in infants.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == bacterial pathogens associated with secondary peritonitis in lagos university teaching hospital (luth).
AB  == secondary peritonitis is a common and serious form of intra-abdominal infection,  often associated with high morbidity and mortality. the overall patient outcome has not markedly improved in spite of advances in patient management. there is therefore need to study the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with secondary peritonitis in lagos university teaching hospital (luth) and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern as that would help in formulation of empiric antibiotic policy on peritonitis and improve the outcome/prognosis of the patients. a prospective study of 35 patients with suspected peritonitis at luth between february, 2002 and june 2003 was done. peritoneal fluids of these patients were collected intra-operatively under aseptic conditions. the specimens were subjected to aerobic and anaerobic studies. twenty-seven isolates were identified aerobically with escherichia coli being the most predominant organism  11 (31.4%) followed by staphylococcus aureus 6 (17.1%) then klebsiella spp 4 (11.4%). anaerobic culture showed prevotella species as the most predominant 14 (40%) followed by bacteroides fragilis group 8 (22.9%). overall, prevotella species were the most predominant organisms isolated in luth patients with secondary peritonitis.

TI  == a review of new fluoroquinolones : focus on their use in respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the new respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and on the horizon, garenoxacin) offer many improved qualities over older agents such as ciprofloxacin. these include retaining excellent activity against gram-negative bacilli, with improved gram-positive activity (including streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus). in addition, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and garenoxacin all demonstrate increased anaerobic activity (including activity against bacteroides fragilis). the new fluoroquinolones possess greater bioavailability and longer serum half-lives compared with ciprofloxacin. the new fluoroquinolones allow for once-daily administration, which may improve patient adherence. the high bioavailability allows for rapid step down from intravenous administration to oral therapy, minimizing unnecessary hospitalization, which may decrease costs and improve quality of life of patients. clinical trials involving the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections (acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia) demonstrate high bacterial eradication rates and clinical cure rates. in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, the various new fluoroquinolones appear to be comparable to each other, but may be more effective than macrolide or cephalosporin-based regimens. however, additional data are required before it can be emphatically stated that the new fluoroquinolones as a class are responsible for better outcomes than comparators in community-acquired respiratory infections. gemifloxacin (except for higher rates of hypersensitivity), levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin have relatively mild adverse effects that are more or less comparable to ciprofloxacin. in our opinion, gatifloxacin should not be used, due to glucose alterations which may be serious. although all new fluoroquinolones react with metal ion-containing drugs (antacids), other drug interactions are relatively mild compared with ciprofloxacin. the new fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin have  much to offer in terms of bacterial eradication, including activity against resistant respiratory pathogens such as penicillin-resistant, macrolide-resistant, and multidrug-resistant s. pneumoniae. however, ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms, including ciprofloxacin-resistant s. pneumoniae, are becoming more prevalent, thus prudent use must be exercised when  prescribing these valuable agents.

AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == identification of bacteroides fragilis by co-agglutination, using a specific monoclonal antibody.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody, mabc3 (igg(2b)), specific for the bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide (lps) was produced and found to react with a common epitope in most strains within the species. mabc3 was adsorbed to staphylococcus aureus cowan i strain and used in a co-agglutination assay for identification of b. fragilis. almost 98% of the b. fragilis strains were positive in co-agglutination. among the 283 non-b. fragilis only two strains showed false positive reaction. these results show that the mabc3 has a high specificity and can be used for the rapid identification of the b. fragilis species.

TI  == an in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  == objective: to determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. method: three bioxygenating hydrogels were  tested: oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and iodozyme 402 and iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. cut squares of control or test dressings were placed  on top of each disk. kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. results: significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. the order of sensitivity for oxyzyme was fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (iodozyme 402, followed by iodozyme 401 and then oxyzyme) was  the same regardless of the target species. conclusion: the novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.

TI  == [psoas abscesses. an up-dated perspective].
AB  == objective: to analyze the characteristics of abscesses of the psoas muscle and assess the differences between pyogenic and tuberculous abscesses. methods: retrospective descriptive study of all patients with psoas abscess in our hospital over the period 1994 to 2004. results: fourteen patients were studied (10 males), with a mean age of 42 years. half of them had had an underlying disease. the most frequent clinical manifestations were abdominal pain (64%), fever (57%), and back pain (43%). all the abscesses were secondary. in 7 patients the origin was gastrointestinal, in 6 osteoarticular, and 1 was related with infection of an aortobifemoral bypass. computed tomography was the diagnostic imaging method in all patients. culture of drainage specimens was positive in 92% of patients undergoing this procedure. causal microorganisms included mycobacterium tuberculosis (5), streptococcus intermedius (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), escherichia coli (3) and bacteroides fragilis (2). tuberculous abscesses originated in spondylitis and the clinical presentation was longer prior to diagnosis. drainage was performed in 12 patients (8 percutaneous and 4 surgical). mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 4 weeks. the infection resolved in all patients. conclusions: psoas abscess commonly had a gastrointestinal and osteoarticular origin. we underscore the high percentage of  tuberculous etiology, which had a more insidious clinical and analytical presentation and was usually secondary to spondylitis. prolonged antimicrobial treatment associated with drainage was effective therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of clove and thyme extracts.
AB  == objective: it has been postulated that geographical locations of the herbs affect the constituents of their essential oils and thus the degree of their antimicrobial action. this study examine two samples of clove obtained from sri lanka and zanzibar and two samples of thyme from iran and oman to determine the antimicrobial potential of their extracted oils. method: the active agents in each plant were extracted by steam distillation and by boiling. the antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined at neat and by two-fold dilutions in well agar diffusion technique using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium species, salmonella species, bacteroides fragilis and candida albicans. results: all oil extracts possessed antimicrobial activity against all bacteria and yeast tested.  their water extracts exhibited lower antimicrobial activity, though thyme aqueous extract was active only against s. aureus. the lowest concentration of antimicrobial activity (0.1% i.e., 1:1024) was obtained with thyme oil extract using candida albicans. there was no significant difference in antimicrobial activity between clove obtained from sri lanka or zanzibar or thyme obtained from iran or oman. conclusion: our experiment showed that the country of origin of the herbs has no effect on their antimicrobial activity. however, further work is necessary to ascertain why candida albicans displayed remarkable degree of sensitivity with the extracts than all the other organisms test.

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == bacteroides species produce vibrio harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules.
AB  == quorum sensing is a density-dependent gene regulation mechanism that has been described in many bacterial species in the last decades. bacteria that use quorum sensing as part of their gene regulation circuits produce molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the environment and activate target genes in a quorum-dependent way. some specific clues led us to hypothesize that bacteroides  species can produce autoinducers and possess a quorum sensing system. first, bacteroides are anaerobic bacteria that are frequently involved in polymicrobial  infections. these infections often involve pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, two of the best understood examples of bacteria that employ quorum sensing systems as part of their pathogenesis. also, studies have detected the presence of a quorum sensing gene involved in the production of autoinducers in porphyromonas gingivalis, a species closely related to the bacteroides genus. these and other evidences prompted us to investigate if bacteroides strains could produce autoinducer molecules that could be detected by a vibrio harveyi reporter system. in this paper, we show that supernatants of b.  fragilis, b. vulgatus and b. distasonis strains are able to stimulate the v. harveyi quorum sensing system 2. also, we were able to demonstrate that the stimulation detected is due to the production of autoinducer molecules and not the growth of reporter strains after addition of supernatant. moreover, the phenomenon observed does not seem to represent the degradation of repressors possibly present in the culture medium used. we could also amplify bands from some of the strains tested using primers designed to the luxs gene of escherichia coli. altogether, our results show that b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and b. distasonis (but possibly some other species) can produce v. harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules. however, the role of such molecules in the biology of these  organisms remains unknown.

TI  == neutropenia induced in outbred mice by a simplified low-dose cyclophosphamide regimen: characterization and applicability to diverse experimental models of infectious diseases.
AB  == background: for its low cost and ease of handling, the mouse remains the preferred experimental animal for preclinical tests. to avoid the interaction of  the animal immune system, in vivo antibiotic pharmacodynamic studies often employ cyclophosphamide (cpm) to induce neutropenia. although high doses (350-450 mg/kg) are still used and their effects on mouse leukocytes have been described, a lower dose (250 mg/kg) is widely preferred today, but the characteristics and applicability of this approach in outbred mice have not been determined. methods: fifteen female icr mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 and 100 mg/kg of cpm on days 1 and 4, respectively. blood samples (approximately 160 microl) were  drawn from the retro-orbital sinus of each mouse on days 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11. leukocytes were counted manually and the number of granulocytes was based on microscopic examination of wright-stained smears. the impact of neutropenia induced by this method was then determined with a variety of pathogens in three different murine models of human infections: pneumonia (klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus), meningoencephalitis (s. pneumoniae), and the thigh model (s. aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis). results: the basal count of leukocytes was within the normal range for outbred mice. on day 4, there was an 84% reduction in total white blood cells, and by day 5 the leukopenia reached its nadir (370 +/- 84 cells/mm3). profound neutropenia (< or =10 neutrophils/mm3) was demonstrated at day 4 and persisted through days 5 and 6. lymphocytes and monocytes had a 92% and 96% decline between days 1 and 5, respectively. leukocytes recovered completely by day 11. mice immunosupressed under this protocol displayed clinical and microbiological patterns of progressive and lethal infectious diseases after inoculation in different organs with diverse human pathogens. conclusion: a cpm total dose of 250 mg/kg is sufficient to induce profound and sustained neutropenia (<10 neutrophils/mm3) at least during 3 days in outbred mice, is simpler than previously described methods, and allows successful induction of infection in a variety of experimental models.

TI  == analysis of microbial etiology and mortality in patients with brain abscess.
AB  == objectives: despite the technological advancements in diagnostic and neurosurgical procedures, brain abscess continues to remain a potentially fatal central nervous system infection. in a prospective study we determined the predisposing factors and the microbiological profile of brain abscess. we also analyzed the mortality in patients with the type of infections identified. methods: over a period of 8 years (1997-2004), aspirated pus from 118 patients with brain abscess was directly inoculated into bactec plus+ aerobic and bactec plus+ anaerobic media immediately after collection and subcultured on solid media as appropriate. predisposing factors, if any, were recorded in all patients. mortality of patients during hospital stay was correlated with the type of infections identified. results: predisposing factors were identified in 94 (79.7%) patients, otogenic infection being the most common (37/118; 31.4%). microorganisms were demonstrated in 96 (81.4%) patients, by culture in 89 (75.4%) patients and by gram stain in 7 (5.9%) additional cases. a total of 105 organisms were isolated - 67 (63.8%) aerobes, 32 (30.5%) anaerobes, 5 (4.8%) mycobacteria and 1 (0.9%) fungus. viridans streptococci (23.8%), staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), bacteroides fragilis group/species and peptostreptococcus species (10.5% each) were the common isolates. overall mortality was 14.4%; patients with gram-negative infections had higher mortality than gram-positive infections (6/20; 30% vs. 6/63; 9.5%; p=0.02). conclusions: culture of pus immediately after aspiration in an automated system yields good results. gram stain coupled with culture can guide the neurosurgeons better to treat their patients more rationally. patients with gram-negative infections need special attention in terms of management because of high mortality rate.

AB  == post transplant infection is one of the serious complications of the organ recipients. we detected the donor infections and allograft contaminations in a limited period of time by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and rapid shaking culture (rsc). the pre-procurement blood from 86 possible renal donors as well as the preservation solution (ps) and renal pelvic urine (pu) from 158 grafts were examined in order to detect highly virulent organisms such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fungi. the average age of donors was 48.8 years old. the average period between the admission and brain death was 4.9 days, and the average period between the brain  death and cardiac arrest was 3.6 days. the inflammatory indices such as body temperature, white blood cell count and c-reactive protein increased to 37.9 +/-  1.1 degree c, 12,600 +/- 6300/microl, and 20.2 +/- 11.6 mg/dl, respectively. following pcr and rsc, procurement operations of the three possible donors were cancelled because of systemic bacterial infections by mrsa or bacteroides fragilis. six out of 158 grafts were discarded due to the diagnoses of mrsa or candida albicans in ps and/or pu. all the other 148 grafts were transplanted. following transplant, no single infectious complication transmitted by the graft  was noted. we conclude that pcr combined with rsc is very accurate and useful for detecting donor infections and allograft contaminations, which may cause severe complications in the recipients.

TI  == bacteriological study of diabetic foot infections.
AB  == aims: the polymicrobial nature of diabetic foot infection has been well documented in the literature. patients with diabetic foot infection not exposed to antibiotics are not well studied before. the relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from community-acquired foot infections that are not exposed to antimicrobial agents for 30 days is studied. in addition, the bacterial comparative in vitro susceptibility to the commonly used antibacterial agents is  assessed. methods: this is a prospective study in which the infected wounds of 86 consecutive diabetic patients seen in the diabetic foot clinic in adan teaching hospital were cultured when visiting the clinic. the patients did not receive antimicrobial therapy 30 days prior to taking the cultures. the specimen was cultured using aerobic and anaerobic microbiological techniques. isolates were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial therapy. result: staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate, being recovered from 38.4% of  cases. other organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5%) and proteus mirabilis  (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (10.5%), mainly bacteroides fragilis. imipenem, meropenem, and cefepime were the most effective agents against gram-negative organisms. vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive  organisms. conclusion: s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. anaerobic organisms are still a common cause for infection, although the prevalence is less. these wounds may require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial management.

AB  == objective: to explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. methods: observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (nt). results: (1) model bile were suitable for the growth of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and clostridium. propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) with  pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. conclusions: pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linezolid in obese patients with cellulitis.
AB  == background: linezolid is an oxazolidinone antimicrobial with excellent oral bioavailability and tissue penetration and is active against multidrug-resistant  skin/soft tissue pathogens. objective: to study the pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity of linezolid against selective skin/soft tissue pathogens  in obese patients. methods: we obtained multiple serum samples from 7 obese patients (>50% over their calculated ideal body weight) receiving oral linezolid  600 mg every 12 hours for treatment of cellulitis. following a minimum of 3 doses, serum concentrations of linezolid were measured in each subject prior to (trough) and 1 and 6 hours after a dose. these samples were then tested against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (linezolid minimum inhibitory concentrations [mics] 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 microg/ml) and  one strain each of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) (mic 2.0 microg/ml), bacteroides fragilis (mic 2.0 microg/ml), and peptostreptococcus magnus (mic 1.0 microg/ml). serum inhibitory titers (sits) and bactericidal titers (sbts) were measured at each time point, and the median activity for these 7 patients was calculated. results: mean linezolid serum concentrations were 4.2, 12.3, and 7.2 microg/ml at these respective time points. median sits for 12 hours (100% of the dosing interval) were observed against each organism with the exception of the least susceptible strain of mrsa (mic 4.0 microg/ml); serum inhibitory activity was observed only at the one-hour time point against this isolate. furthermore, prolonged (> or =6 h) median sbts were observed against one isolate of mrsa (mic 1.0 microg/ml) as well as the strain of vre and p. magnus. conclusions: serum concentrations of oral linezolid in this patient population were diminished compared with those of healthy volunteers, but still provided prolonged serum inhibitory activity against common pathogens associated with skin/soft tissue infections. one treatment concern would be an obese patient receiving oral linezolid who was infected with a less susceptible (mic > or =4.0  microg/ml) strain of s. aureus. bactericidal activity was also observed against selective pathogens.

TI  == drug susceptibility of isolates from severe postoperative intraperitoneal infections causing multiple organ failure.
AB  == purpose: to select the most appropriate antibiotic regimens for life-threatening  postoperative infections, we obtained isolates from patients with severe postoperative infections over a 12-year-period, and examined their drug susceptibility. methods: the subjects of this study were 55 patients with multiple organ failure (mof) caused by postoperative infection. results: all strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were susceptible to vancomycin (vcm) and teicoplanin (teic). only 0.3% of all the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem (ipm), but 53.6% of the strains from the severe infections were resistant to ipm. on the other hand, there were few p. aeruginosa strains resistant to meropenem (mepm), ceftazidime (caz), ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and pazufloxacin (pzfx), even among strains isolated from severe infections. the resistant rate of bacteroides fragilis to clindamycin (cldm) was 35.9%, but there were strains resistant to ipm and panipenem. conclusion: these findings suggest that vcm or teic are most appropriate for severe abdominal abscess caused by mrsa, whereas mepm, caz, cpfx, and pzfx are more effective against p. aeruginosa infections. the only antibiotic effective against b. fragilis infections in this study was ipm.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

TI  == inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == aims: to examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on helicobacter pylori (hp) growth. methods and results: the effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. the inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and hp strains, and were method dependent. the caga status of hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. conclusions: helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. the success  and progress of hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. significance and impact of the study: this study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. these results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16srrna genes pcr amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == controlled clinical comparison of the bact/alert fn and the standard anaerobic sn blood culture medium.
AB  == to determine the optimal anaerobic companion bottle to pair with the bact/alert (biomerieux, durham, n.c.) nonvented aerobic fa (fa) medium for recovery of pathogenic microorganisms from adult patients with bacteremia and fungemia, we compared the bact/alert fn (fn) anaerobic bottle with the standard bact/alert sn  (sn) anaerobic bottle. each bottle, fa, fn, and sn, was filled with 8 to 12 ml of blood. of 11,498 blood culture sets received in the clinical microbiology laboratories at two university medical centers, 7,945 sets had all three bottles  filled adequately and 8,569 had both anaerobic bottles filled adequately. of 686  clinically important (based on previously published criteria) isolates detected in one or both adequately filled anaerobic bottles, more staphylococci (p < 0.001), including staphylococcus aureus (p < 0.001); members of the family enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.001); and all microorganisms combined (p < 0.001) were  detected in fn bottles. in contrast, more pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (p < 0.01) and yeasts (p < 0.001) were detected in sn bottles. more bacteroides fragilis group bacteremias were detected only in the fn (six) than in the sn (one) anaerobic bottle (p = not significant). overall, the mean time to detection was shorter with fn (16.8 h) than with sn (18.2 h). this difference in time to detection was greatest for the b. fragilis group: fn, 28 h, versus sn, 60.0 h. many of the facultative microorganisms recovered in either fn or sn were also found in the companion fa. when microorganisms found in the companion fa bottle were omitted from the analysis, significantly more staphylococci (p < 0.001), including s. aureus (p < 0.001), and enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.005) still were detected in fn bottles, whereas there were no significant differences for p. aeruginosa and yeasts, which were found as expected in fa bottles. we conclude that the companion anaerobic fn bottle detects more microorganisms than does the  anaerobic sn bottle when used in conjunction with the nonvented aerobic fa bottle in the bact/alert blood culture system.

TI  == surgical infections: a microbiological study.
AB  == surgical infections are mostly polymicrobial, involving both aerobes and anaerobes. one hundred seventeen cases comprised of abscesses (n=51), secondary peritonitis (n=25), necrotizing fascitis (n=22) and wounds with devitalized tissues (n=19) were studied. the number of microorganisms isolated per lesion was highest in secondary peritonitis (2.32). the aerobe/ anaerobe ratio was 0.81 in secondary peritonitis and 1.8 in necrotizing fascitis. most secondary peritonitis (80%), necrotizing fascitis (75%) and wounds with devitalized tissues (66.7%) were polymicrobial. common microorganisms isolated in our study were e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. the most effective antibiotics for s. aureus were clindamycin (79.1%) and cefuroxime (70.8%). for gram-negatives (klebsiella spp., e. coli and proteus spp.), the most effective antibiotics were cefotaxime,  ceftizoxime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. pseudomonas aeruginosa was maximally sensitive to amikacin (35.2%) and ciprofloxacin (35.2%). the greatest degree of multidrug resistance to all the drugs was found in p. aeruginosa (52.9%), followed by klebsiella spp. (33.3%), proteus spp. (33.3%), e. coli (22.2%), and s. aureus (12.5%). all the anaerobes that we isolated were 100% sensitive to metronidazole and chloramphenicol, followed by clindamycin (95% to 100%). apart from antibiotic therapy, non-antimicrobial methods, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and debridement also play an important role in the treatment of surgical  infections.

TI  == intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and visceral abscesses in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal abscesses (including subphrenic, hepatic, splenic, and retroperitoneal abscesses) in children. they often occur as a complication of local or generalized peritonitis, commonly secondary to appendicitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian infection, surgery or trauma. the original infection generally occurs because of the entry of enteric microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from most abscesses. the predominant aerobic isolates are escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus spp. and the main anaerobic bacteria are bacteroides fragilis group  peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and clostridium spp. the treatment of intraabdominal abscesses includes drainage, surgical correction of pathology,  and administration of antimicrobials effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  == ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. ertapenem is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. it has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. mic(90)s for most species of enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/l, significantly lower than those of imipenem. mic(90)s for most bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l, and mic(90)s were species specific for clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/l for clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/l for clostridium clostridioforme. ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in gram-negative organisms.

TI  == beta-lactamase stability of faropenem.
AB  == faropenem (far) is an orally available member of the penem class unique among carbapenems and other available beta-lactams. this study compared far to cephalosporins and imipenem with respect to beta-lactamase (bla) stability and emergence of resistance to staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. bla stability was studied using enzyme preparations from sonicated/centrifuged 24-hour cultures of e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, providencia  rettgeri, klebsiella pneumoniae, s. aureus, and bacteroides fragilis grown in the presence of 20 mg/l ampicillin or cephaloridine to induce penicillinase or cephalosporinase, respectively. substrate hydrolysis was quantitated spectrophotometrically. multistep acquisition of resistance was promoted by growing bacteria in broth containing 2-fold dilutions of antibiotic over 10 cycles. aliquots from test tubes with visible growth provided the inoculum for the next series of dilutions. far as well as other cephalosporins tested were highly stable to penicillinase derived from s. aureus and e. coli. however, e. coli- and p. vulgaris-derived cephalosporinase hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefaclor and cefotiam considerably, whereas far was highly stable. far was highly stable against hydrolysis by various blas prepared from four b. fragilis strains and the rate of far hydrolysis by metallo-bla was 5 times lower than that for imipenem. additionally, the acquisition of resistant s. aureus strains was less pronounced  for far compared to other agents tested. mics rose 8-fold after the 10th sub-mic  exposure, while mics rose 16-, 31- and 512-fold for cefixime, cefazolin and cefaclor, respectively. e. coli shifts in mics were moderate for all the agents tested. in conclusion, far is characterized by pronounced bla stability compared  to other cephalosporins and imipenem. furthermore, a lower propensity for resistance development with far as compared to cephalosporins was observed.

TI  == [comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem (mk-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 enterobacteriaceae, 15 aeromonas spp., 42 staphylococcus spp., 43 streptococcus spp., 15 enterococcus spp., 30 haemophilus  spp., 15 moraxella catarrhalis, 12 neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 clostridium spp., 12 peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group bacteroides recovered from four spanish hospitals. ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae  (mic(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded ampc betalactamase-producing strains. ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (mic(90) > or =16 mg/l). ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) < or =1 mg/l). in the case of haemophilus spp., m. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a mic(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. when considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against clostridium spp. (mic(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l). both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.

TI  == bacterial reduction by cell salvage washing and leukocyte depletion filtration.
AB  == background: blood conservation techniques are being increasingly used because of  the increased cost and lack of availability of allogeneic blood. cell salvage offers great blood savings opportunities but is thought to be contraindicated in  a number of areas (e.g., blood contaminated with bacteria). several outcome studies have suggested the safety of this technique in trauma and colorectal surgery, but many practitioners are still hesitant to apply cell salvage in the face of frank bacterial contamination. this study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of bacterial removal when cell salvage was combined with leukocyte depletion filtration. methods: expired packed erythrocytes were obtained and inoculated with a fixed amount of a stock bacteria (escherichia coli american type culture collections [atcc] 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, or bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) in amounts  ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 colony forming units/ml. the blood was processed via  a cell salvage machine. the washed blood was then filtered using a leukocyte reduction filter. the results for blood taken during each step of processing were compared using a repeated-measures design. results: fifteen units of blood were contaminated with each of the stock bacteria. from the prewash sample to the postfiltration sample, 99.0%, 99.6%, 100%, and 97.6% of e. coli, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and b. fragilis were removed, respectively. discussion: significant but not complete removal of contaminating bacteria was seen. an increased level of patient safety may be added to cell salvage by including a leukocyte depletion filter when salvaging blood that might be grossly contaminated with bacteria.

AB  == aim: to determine whether an association exists between ciprofloxacin and faropenem resistance in bacteria including multiply drug-resistant isolates. methods: the mics were determined for 150 fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria, plus 20 nalidixic acid-resistant strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. results: faropenem was very active against escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, but 5/31 staphylococcus aureus and 2/26 bacteroides fragilis required > or =16 mg/l for inhibition. of 30 multiply drug-resistant isolates with a phenotype suggestive of enhanced efflux, only for one strain (a bacteroides fragilis) was the faropenem mic higher than that associated with the  other isolates of the same species. conclusions: faropenem was in general as active as imipenem. there was no association between resistance to ciprofloxacin  and faropenem or imipenem resistance.

TI  == [psoas abscesses. genesis, diagnosis, and therapy].
AB  == background: a psoas abscess is a rarely encountered entity with various etiologies and nonspecific clinical presentation, frequently resulting in delayed diagnosis, increased morbidity, and prolonged or recurrent hospitalization. patients and methods: between january 1996 and january 2002 we treated ten patients (approximately 54.8, 5 males,5 females). these cases were analyzed retrospectively relative to a review of the literature. results: ct scanning was  decisive in the final diagnosis of psoas abscess. primary psoas abscess occurred  in four cases and six patients had secondary abscesses. in all except one case, the psoas abscess was located on the right side. the causes of primary abscesses  were retroperitoneal perforated appendicitis, paravertebral injections for lumboischialgia, pott's disease, and repeated intravenous drug application in the groin. five patients underwent retroperitoneal open drainage and four patients ct-guided drainage. one patient with retroperitoneal perforated appendicitis was  treated by laparotomy. staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli were the most common infective agents. there was no postoperative mortality and no cases of abscess recurred. conclusions: ct scan is a diagnostic "gold standard" for psoas abscess. ct-guided drainage is the method  of first choice, but is not possible in all cases. open retroperitoneal drainage  is a standard method of treatment. postoperative antibiotic therapy is obligatory and should be adapted individually.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical patient.
AB  == antimicrobial selection for prophylaxis in surgery is based on the site of surgery, likely pathogen involved in addition to the in vitro efficacy, pharmacokinetics and the cost of the drugs used. for example, prophylactic agent  in cardiovascular or orthopedic and skin and soft tissue surgery must cover against staphylococcus aureus as well as the enterobacteriaceae; cephalosporins being adequate. on the other hand, any drug used in cases of urologic surgery must be excreted by the kidney in an active state and should also be active against e. coli, a common uropathogen such as any cephalosporins or penicillin. drugs like macrolides and tetracyclines accumulate in the prostate and are good for prostate surgery by they are not excreted well by the kidney and therefore useless for urological prophylaxis. it is important to note that even treating minor infections in a neurosurgical patient, we must use an antibiotic that cross blood-brain barrier otherwise meningitis might develop. in cases of gastrointestinal tract, surgery on the colon and appendix requires special coverage against anaerobic bacteria especially bacteroides fragilis. on the other hand surgery on the stomach, gall-bladder and upper two thirds of small intestine, it is adequate to use drugs to cover aerobic bacteria such as e. coli. most studies show that a single most effective antibiotic is enough and it is unnecessary to use two or more drug combinations.

TI  == cd4+ t cells mediate abscess formation in intra-abdominal sepsis by an il-17-dependent mechanism.
AB  == abscess formation associated with intra-abdominal sepsis causes severe morbidity  and can be fatal. previous studies have implicated t cells in the pathogenesis of abscess formation, and we have recently shown that cd4(+) t cells activated in vitro by zwitterionic capsular polysaccharides from abscess-inducing bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis initiate this host response when transferred to naive rats. in this study, we show that mice deficient in alphabetatcr-bearing t cells or cd4(+) t cells fail to develop abscesses following challenge with b. fragilis or abscess-inducing zwitterionic polysaccharides, compared with cd8(-/-) or wild-type animals. transfer of cd4(+)  t cells from wild-type mice to alphabetatcr(-/-) animals reconstituted this ability. the induction of abscesses required t cell costimulation via the cd28-b7 pathway, and t cell transfer experiments with stat4(-/-) and stat6(-/-) mice demonstrated that this host response is dependent on stat4 signaling. significantly higher levels of il-17, a proinflammatory cytokine produced almost  exclusively by activated cd4(+) t cells, were associated with abscess formation in th2-impaired (stat6(-/-)) mice, while stat4(-/-) mice had significantly lower  levels of this cytokine than control animals. the formation of abscesses was preceded by an increase in the number of activated cd4(+) t cells in the peritoneal cavity 24 h following bacterial challenge. confocal laser-scanning microscopy analysis revealed that cd4(+) t cells comprise the abscess wall in these animals and produce il-17 at this site. administration of a neutralizing ab specific for il-17 prevented abscess formation following bacterial challenge in mice. these data delineate the specific t cell response necessary for the development of intra-abdominal abscesses and underscore the role of il-17 in this disease process.

TI  == microbiology of polymicrobial abscesses and implications for therapy.
AB  == abscesses that develop as a result of introduction of the normal flora into a normally sterile body site are often polymicrobial. this review summarizes past studies published by our group on the microbiology of polymicrobial abscesses that occur at various body sites. staphylococcus aureus and group a beta-haemolytic streptococci are the most prevalent aerobes in skin and soft tissue abscesses and are isolated at all body sites. in contrast, organisms that  colonize the mucous membranes predominated in infections adjacent to these membranes. in this fashion, organisms of the gastrointestinal and cervical flora  (enteric gram-negative bacilli and bacteroides fragilis group) were found most often in intra-abdominal and buttock and leg lesions. group a beta-haemolytic streptococci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp., and fusobacterium spp. were most commonly found in lesions of the mouth, head, neck and fingers. these organisms probably reached these sites from the oral cavity, where they are part  of the normal flora. drainage of the abscess is the treatment of choice. appropriate management of these mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections may also require the administration of antimicrobials that are effective against both the  aerobic and anaerobic components of the infections.

TI  == zwitterionic polysaccharides stimulate t cells by mhc class ii-dependent interactions.
AB  == polysaccharides of pathogenic extracellular bacteria commonly have negatively charged groups or no charged groups at all. these molecules have been considered  classic t cell-independent ags that do not elicit cell-mediated immune responses  in mice. however, bacterial polysaccharides with a zwitterionic charge motif (zpss), such as the capsular polysaccharides of many strains of bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae type 1 elicit potent cd4(+) t cell responses in vivo and in vitro. the cell-mediated response to zps depends on the presence of both positively charged and negatively charged  groups on each repeating unit of the polysaccharide. in this study, we define some of the requirements for the presentation of zps to cd4(+) t cells. we provide evidence that direct interactions of t cells with apcs are essential for  t cell activation by zps. monocytes, dendritic cells, and b cells are all able to serve as apcs for zps-mediated t cell activation. apcs lacking mhc class ii molecules do not support this activity. furthermore, mab to hla-dr specifically blocks zps-mediated t cell activation, while mabs to other mhc class ii and class i molecules do not. immunoprecipitation of lysates of mhc class ii-expressing cells following incubation with zps shows binding of zps and hla-dr. electron microscopy reveals colocalization of zps with hla-dr on the cell surface and in compartments of the endocytic pathway. these results indicate that mhc class ii molecules expressing hla-dr on professional apcs are required for zps-induced t cell activation. the implication is that binding of zps to hla-dr may be required for t cell activation.

TI  == effect of a single percutaneous abscess drainage puncture and imipenem therapy, alone or in combination, in treatment of mixed-infection abscesses in mice.
AB  == the importance of supplementary imipenem therapy after a single percutaneous abscess drainage puncture was studied in a mouse model of established mixed-infection abscesses. animals were treated for 3 days with daily dosing regimens of 384 to 1,536 mg/kg of body weight that took into account the short half-life of this antibiotic in mice. imipenem therapy in conjunction with abscess drainage was significantly better than drainage alone in reducing the escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis counts in the mixed infections. furthermore, the killing of b. fragilis by the combination of imipenem therapy and abscess drainage was significantly better than that by imipenem treatment alone. the maximum reductions in e. coli and b. fragilis counts were 1.1 and 2.2  log(10) cfu/abscess, respectively. in contrast, the in vitro activity of imipenem was significantly better (maximum reduction, > or =6.2 log(10) cfu/ml) against mixed cultures of the same strains even when bacterial numbers similar to those found in the abscesses were used. comparable in vivo activity was achieved only when treatment was started 30 min before inoculation (reduction for both strains, > or =6.1 log(10) cfu/abscess), but this killing was significantly diminished if  the start of treatment was delayed until > or =12 h after inoculation. imipenem concentrations in abscess tissue reached levels above the mic for e. coli for >60% of the dosing interval. possible reasons for the reduced activity of imipenem in vivo are discussed, and we conclude that standard susceptibility tests overestimate the efficacy of this antibiotic against the organisms present  in these abscesses.

AB  == cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus.  nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.

AB  == bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) activate cells of innate immunity, such as macrophages, by stimulating signaling through toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4). we and others have hypothesized that lps derived from different bacterial species may function through tlr4-independent mechanisms. to test this hypothesis, we have generated using a nonviral transformation procedure a bone marrow-derived macrophage cell line called 10scncr/23 from mouse strain c57bl/10scncr. this mouse strain has a deletion of the tlr4 locus, causing the mouse strain to be nonresponsive to stimulation by lps from escherichia coli while responding normally to other bacterial substrates, such as lipoteichoic acid (lta) from staphylococcus aureus, which signal tlr4 independently. stimulation with lta induces five- and sixfold increases in 10scncr/23 cell line tumor necrosis factor alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (mip-2) secretion, but no increases in either cytokine were found when cells were stimulated with e. coli lps. bacteroides fragilis-derived lps, however, can effectively stimulate mip-2 expression in the absence of functional tlr4 in the 10scncr/23 cell line. this gives rise to the notion that lps from some bacterial species will utilize alternative receptors to stimulate the innate immune response.

AB  == n-acetylchitooligosaccharides ((glcnac)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. a chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using hcl. after purification, the purity of each (glcnac)(1-6) was >86%. the growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (bm) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize glcnac and (glcnac)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium limosum could use (glcnac)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (glcnac)(1-6). glcnac was used more readily than (glcnac)(2-6) by staphylococcus  aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. in bm, streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.

TI  == pharmacodynamic properties of hmr 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  == objective: the pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, hmr 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. methods: the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the postantibiotic effects of hmr 3004 were also investigated on these organisms  at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. results: the time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3004  exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x mic. conclusions: the bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by hmr 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == a critical review of the fluoroquinolones: focus on respiratory infections.
AB  == the new fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin) offer excellent activity against gram-negative bacilli and improved gram-positive activity (e.g. against streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus) over ciprofloxacin. ciprofloxacin still maintains the best in vitro activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin display improved activity against anaerobes (e.g. bacteroides fragilis) versus ciprofloxacin. all  of the new fluoroquinolones display excellent bioavailability and have longer serum half-lives than ciprofloxacin allowing for once daily dose administration.  clinical trials comparing the new fluoroquinolones to each other or to standard therapy have demonstrated good efficacy in a variety of community-acquired respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis). limited data suggest that the new fluoroquinolones as a class may lead to better outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis versus comparators. several of these agents have either been withdrawn from the market, had their use severely restricted because of adverse effects (clinafloxacin because of phototoxicity and hypoglycaemia; grepafloxacin because of prolongation of the qtc and resultant torsades de pointes; sparfloxacin because of phototoxicity; and trovafloxacin because of hepatotoxicity), or were discontinued during developmental phases. the remaining fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin have adverse effect profiles similar to ciprofloxacin. extensive post-marketing safety surveillance data (as are available with ciprofloxacin and  levofloxacin) are required for all new fluoroquinolones before safety can be definitively established. drug interactions are limited; however, all fluoroquinolones interact with metal ion containing drugs (eg. antacids). the new fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) offer several advantages over ciprofloxacin and are emerging as important therapeutic agents in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections. their broad spectrum of activity which includes respiratory pathogens such as penicillin and macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, favourable pharmacokinetic parameters, good bacteriological and clinical efficacy will lead to growing use of these agents in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis. these agents may result  in cost savings especially in situations where, because of their potent broad-spectrum activity and excellent bioavailability, they may be used orally in place of intravenous antibacterials. prudent use of the new fluoroquinolones will be required to minimise the development of resistance to these agents.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines of human placental trophoblasts in response to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objective: we studied the production of cytokines in purified cultures of human term trophoblasts in the presence of pathogenic strains of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae, which have been identified in intrauterine infections.  methods: human villous trophoblasts were isolated from term placentas after cesarean section and purified by several steps. after 6, 12, and 24 hours of incubation with the different heat-inactivated bacteria, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-8 (il-8), and interleukin-10 (il-10) as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) were measured from supernatants by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. expression of cytokine mrnas was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). results: in nonstimulated cultures, low (il-1beta and tnf-alpha) and high (il-6, il-8, and il-10) basal secretion of cytokines was detectable. the pathogenic microorganisms induced a dose- and time-dependent release of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, and il-10, whereas tnf-alpha secretion was not elevated. e coli was the most potent inducer followed by b fragilis, s agalactiae, s aureus, and m hominis. transcripts encoding il-1beta, il-6, il-8, or il-10 were elevated in the rt-pcr reactions, suggesting  that transcriptional mechanisms contribute to elevated cytokine expression. conclusion: pathogenic microorganisms stimulated mrna expression and polypeptide  release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from placental trophoblasts. induction of both inflammation-promoting and inflammation-inhibiting cytokines by bacterial products could play a role in modulating the inflammatory response associated with chorioamnionitis.

AB  == little is known about the relative importance of the four species of lancefield group g beta-hemolytic streptococci in causing bacteremia and the factors that determine the outcome for patients with group g beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia. from 1997 to 2000, 75 group g beta-hemolytic streptococcal strains were isolated from the blood cultures of 66 patients. sequencing of the 16s rrna  genes of the group g beta-hemolytic streptococci showed that all 75 isolates were streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis. the api system (20 strep) and  vitek system (gpi) successfully identified 65 (98.5%) and 62 (93.9%) isolates, respectively, as s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis with >95% confidence, whereas the atb expression system (id32 strep) only successfully identified 49 isolates (74.2%) as s. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis with >95% confidence.  the median age of the patients was 76 years (range, 33 to 99 years). fifty-six patients (85%) were over 60 years old. all patients had underlying diseases. no source of the bacteremia was identified (primary bacteremia) in 34 patients (52%), whereas 17 (26%) had cellulitis and 8 (12%) had bed sore or wound infections. fifty-eight patients (88%) had community-acquired group g streptococcal bacteremia. sixty-two patients (94%) had group g streptococcus recovered in one blood culture, whereas 4 patients (6%) had it recovered in multiple blood cultures. fifty-nine patients (89%) had group g streptococcus as the only bacterium recovered in their blood cultures, whereas in 7 patients other bacteria were recovered concomitantly with the group g streptococcus in the blood cultures (staphylococcus aureus in 3, clostridium perfringens in 2, citrobacter freundii in 1, and bacteroides fragilis in 1). overall, 10 patients (15%) died. male sex, diagnosis other than cellulitis, hospital-acquired bacteremia, and multiple positive blood cultures were associated with mortality [p < 0.005 (relative risk [rr] = 7.6), p < 0.05 (rr = 3.7), p < 0.005 (rr = 5.6), and p < 0.05 (rr = 5.6), respectively]. unlike group c beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia, group g beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia is not a zoonotic infection in hong kong.

TI  == structural rationale for the modulation of abscess formation by staphylococcus aureus capsular polysaccharides.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a medically important bacterial pathogen that is a common cause of superficial and deep-seated abscesses in humans. most s. aureus isolates produce either a serotype 5 or 8 capsular polysaccharide (cp) that has been shown to enhance bacterial virulence. we investigated the role of s. aureus  cps in modulating abscess formation in an experimental animal model of intraabdominal infection. structural studies of cp8 revealed that it has a zwitterionic charge motif conferred by the negatively charged carboxyl group of n-acetylmannosaminuronic acid and free amino groups available on partially n-acetylated fucosamine residues. we report that purified cp5 and cp8 facilitated intraabdominal abscess formation in animals when given i.p. with a sterile cecal  contents adjuvant. chemical modifications that neutralized the positively or negatively charged groups on cp8 abrogated its ability to provoke abscesses. rats prophylactically treated with cp8 s.c. were protected against abscess formation induced by homologous or heterologous zwitterionic polysaccharides. likewise, treatment with cp8 protected against challenge with viable s. aureus strains ps80 (a capsule type 8 strain) or col (a methicillin-resistant capsule type 5 strain). purified cp8 was a potent activator of rat and human cd4(+) t cells in vitro. when transferred to naive rats, these activated t cells modulated the development of intraabdominal abscess formation. these results provide a structure/function rationale for abscess formation by s. aureus and expand the sphere of encapsulated organisms that interact directly with t cells to regulate this host  response to bacterial infection.

TI  == the yield of blood cultures in a department of emergency medicine.
AB  == this study sought to determine the yield of blood cultures drawn in the department of emergency medicine. the results of 730 blood cultures taken from 718 patients were retrospectively analysed. the total percentage of positive cultures was 9.7%. only 3.4% of the blood cultures were classified as true bacteraemia and the rest as contaminants. the commonest type of isolate was coagulase-negative staphylococci (49%), which were considered contaminants in all cases. other contaminants represented 13.2% of all the positive blood cultures. the following bacteria comprised the group of true bacteraemia: escherichia coli  (12.6%), streptococcus pneumoniae (9.8%), viridans streptococci (7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.8%), bacteroides fragilis (2.8%), moraxella species (1.4%) and flavobacterium species (1.4%). blood cultures were positive in 3.6% of patients with pneumonia and in 10% of patients with urinary tract infections. in  patients with fever of unclear source blood cultures were positive in 3.1% of children between 0-36 months of age and in 1.1% of patients older than 16 years.  as a whole, patients with positive blood cultures were clinically sicker, a higher percentage of them required admission to the hospital and had higher temperatures or rapidly fatal disease, compared with the group of patients with negative blood cultures. in order to improve the yield of blood cultures in febrile patients, first, better a priori identification of those subjects at high risk for bacteraemia will reduce the number of unnecessary blood cultures and second, sterile venipuncture techniques should be improved in order to reduce the number of contaminants.

TI  == [cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein m and capsulae. streptolysin o and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. toxins a and c act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. capsule, protein a, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. in infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group a streptococci are peptostreptococcus magnus, oral prevotella, porphyromonas spp., and fusobacterium spp. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located  next to the perineal area. penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of  streptococcal infections. however benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci  and anaerobes. in some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. the efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ  failure.

TI  == bacterial pathogens induce abscess formation by cd4(+) t-cell activation via the  cd28-b7-2 costimulatory pathway.
AB  == abscesses are a classic host response to infection by many pathogenic bacteria. the immunopathogenesis of this tissue response to infection has not been fully elucidated. previous studies have suggested that t cells are involved in the pathologic process, but the role of these cells remains unclear. to delineate the mechanism by which t cells mediate abscess formation associated with intra-abdominal sepsis, the role of t-cell activation and the contribution of antigen-presenting cells via cd28-b7 costimulation were investigated. t cells activated in vitro by zwitterionic bacterial polysaccharides (zps) known to induce abscess formation required cd28-b7 costimulation and, when adoptively transferred to the peritoneal cavity of naive rats, promoted abscess formation. blockade of t-cell activation via the cd28-b7 pathway in animals with ctla4ig prevented abscess formation following challenge with different bacterial pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and a combination of enterococcus faecium and bacteroides distasonis. in contrast, these animals had an increased abscess rate following in vivo t-cell activation via cd28 signaling. abscess formation in vivo and t-cell activation in vitro required costimulation by b7-2 but not b7-1. these results demonstrate that abscess formation by pathogenic bacteria is under the control of a common effector mechanism that requires t-cell activation via the cd28-b7-2 pathway.

AB  == the mobilizable bacteroides element nbu2 (11 kbp) was found originally in two bacteroides clinical isolates, bacteroides fragilis erl and b. thetaiotaomicron dot. at first, nbu2 appeared to be very similar to another mobilizable bacteroides element, nbu1, in a 2.5-kbp internal region, but further examination  of the full dna sequence of nbu2 now reveals that the region of near identity between nbu1 and nbu2 is limited to this small region and that, outside this region, there is little sequence similarity between the two elements. the integrase gene of nbu2, intn2, was located at one end of the element. this gene was necessary and sufficient for the integration of nbu2. the integrase of nbu2 has the conserved amino acids (r-h-r-y) in the c-terminal end that are found in members of the lambda family of site-specific integrases. this was also the only  region in which the nbu1 and nbu2 integrases shared any similarity (28% amino acid sequence identity and 49% sequence similarity). integration of nbu2 was site specific in bacteroides species. integration occurred in two primary sites in b.  thetaiotaomicron. both of these sites were located in the 3' end of a serine-trna gene nbu2 also integrated in escherichia coli, but integration was much less site specific than in b. thetaiotaomicron. analysis of the sequence of nbu2 revealed two potential antibiotic resistance genes. the amino acid sequences of the putative proteins encoded by these genes had similarity to resistances found in gram-positive bacteria. only one of these genes was expressed in b. thetaiotaomicron, the homolog of lina, a lincomycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus. to determine how widespread elements related to nbu1 and nbu2 are in bacteroides species, we screened 291 bacteroides strains. elements with some sequence similarity to nbu2 and nbu1 were widespread in bacteroides strains, and the presence of lina(n) in bacteroides strains was highly correlated with the presence of nbu2, suggesting that nbu2 has been responsible for the spread of this gene among bacteroides strains. our results suggest that the nbu-related elements form a large and heterogeneous family, whose members have similar integration mechanisms but have different target sites and differ in whether they carry resistance genes.

TI  == [in vitro activity of faropenem against beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates].
AB  == each 20 strains of beta-lactamase producing methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis group were used as the test strains. drug susceptibility of these strains to faropenem  (frpm), cefdinir, cefditoren, cefcapene, cefteram, cefaclor, and ampicillin was determined by an agar dilution method according to the nccls guideline m100-s9. beta-lactamase activity of the test strains was determined by a spectrophotometric method. in the present study, frpm was highly active against beta-lactamase-producing strains, and no close correlation was found between the  mics of frpm for the test strains and their beta-lactamase activities. these results suggest that frpm has potential in successful application for the treatment of infectious diseases with various types of bacterial pathogens including beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == microbiology of infected poison ivy dermatitis.
AB  == we report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected poison ivy dermatitis. the study involved retrospective review of clinical and microbiology laboratory records of patients with secondarily infected poison ivy  lesions. bacterial growth was noted in 33 specimens. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 18 (55%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only in seven (21%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic bacteria in eight (24%). forty-five isolates were recovered (1.4 per specimen): 27 aerobic or facultative  anaerobic bacteria, and 18 strict anaerobes. the predominant aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (13 isolates) and group a beta-haemolytic streptococci (six). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (seven isolates), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas  spp. (four) and fusobacterium spp. (two). single bacterial isolates were recovered in 18 (55%) patients, eight of which were s. aureus. nineteen of the organisms isolated from 16 (48%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated  in those infections. enteric gram-negative rods and bacteroides fragilis group predominated in leg and buttock lesions. group a beta-haemolytic streptococci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered from lesions of the finger, face and neck. the polymicrobial aetiology of secondarily infected poison ivy lesions, and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical site of the lesions, are demonstrated.

TI  == microbial profile of neonatal infection in coimbatore.
AB  == in this study, 187 consecutive neonates suspected of having septicaemia were investigated for isolation of micro organisms. two samples of blood were collected for isolation of aerobes and anaerobes. cultures were positive in 75 (40%) cases. aerobic bacteria were the major etiological agent, accounting for 93% of positives including the 8% cases showing polymicrobial etiology. anaerobic bacteria and candida species were isolated in 6.6% and 8% of positive cases respectively. bacteroides fragilis (amongst anaerobic) and staphylococcus aureus  (amongst aerobic) were the predominant organisms isolated. clinical presentations were not specifically different to distinguish aerobic from anaerobic bacteria. in the present study, 6.6% of bacteremias were due to anaerobes, hence possibility of some of the bactermias being due to anaerobes should be kept in mind while treating cases of neonatal septicaemia. for a complete microbial profile both aerobic and anaerobic cultures should be done.

TI  == antibacterial properties of kwazulu natal snake venoms.
AB  == the objective was to ascertain whether local snake venoms have antibacterial properties. the venoms of the common night adder (causus rhombeatus), gaboon adder (bitis gabonica), puff adder (bitis arietans), black mamba (dendroaspis polylepis), eastern green mamba (dendroaspis augusticeps), forest cobra (naja melanoleuca), snouted cobra (naja annulifera) and mozambique spitting cobra (naja mossambica) were collected and, by gel diffusion, tested against the bacteria staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeriginosa, bacteriodes fragilis, bacteroides intermedius, clostridium sordellii and clostridium perfringens. all snake venoms showed antibacterial activity, with the adders showing most activity against the aerobes while the cobras showed lesser, but equal activity against the aerobes and anaerobes. black mamba venom only showed activity against c. perfringens. in conclusion, local snake venoms have antibacterial properties which are dependent on the venom and bacterial type; and in the naja spp., for anaerobic bacteria, diminish in winter. there is liable to  be more than one toxin component responsible.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than  comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin mic90s, < or =1 mg/l, except 4 mg/l against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium). gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s, 0.06-0.5  mg/l against most members of the enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/l against proteus/morganella spp.). relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against providencia spp., and had good potency against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.25-1 mg/l). gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had  similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding mic90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. the three quinolones were equipotent against burkholderia cepacia (mic90s, 8 mg/l), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 mg/l). gatifloxacin was highly potent (mic90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/l) against haemophilus influenzae, legionella spp., helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin mic90s, 0.13 mg/l). the higher quinolone mics for ureaplasma (mic90s, 4-8 mg/l) may be due to  the acidic ph of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic90, 0.25 mg/l). of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. in summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.

TI  == fourth generation cephalosporins in the antimicrobial chemotherapy of surgical infections.
AB  == surgical infections include a variety of entities such as secondary peritonitis,  intra-abdominal abscesses, obstetric and gynecological infections as well as bone-joint and soft-tissue infections. by definition the term "surgical infection" implies that surgery itself plays the major role in therapy, while antimicrobial chemotherapy is only supplementary. broad-spectrum empirical regimens employed include the combination of a 1st or 2nd generation cephalosporin plus clindamycin or metronidazole +/- aminoglycoside (depending on  the severity of the condition). cefepime and cefpirome are new 4th generation parenteral cephalosporins with a spectrum of activity which makes them suitable for the treatment of infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria. they are active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa with activity comparable to or greater than that of cefotaxime or ceftazidime respectively. cefepime in particular is also very active against strains of enterobacter and pseudomonas spp resistant to these two agents. in comparison with 3rd generation cephalosporins, cefepime appears to be less likely to induce resistance, due to a lower rate of hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, a low affinity for these enzymes and more rapid permeation into the cell. despite the fact that a 4th generation cephalosporin is well-suited for the treatment of polymicrobial infections, the following should be kept in mind: (i) mrsa strains and bacteroides fragilis group are not included in their spectrum of activity. (ii) cefpirome is the only cephalosporin with in vitro activity against enterococci. (iii) severe surgical infections of nosocomial origin, and particularly in settings where enterobacter  spp predominate, represent the major indication for empirical use of a 4th generation cephalosporin in combination with a nitroimidazole.

TI  == antimicrobial chemotherapy in the control of surgical infectious complications.
AB  == in spite of the progress in surgical technique and antibiotic prophylaxis, postoperative infection still accounts for both the commonest surgical complication and one of the most frequent nosocomial infections, also causing an  increase in duration and costs of hospital stay. the choice of treatment for post-surgical infections requires an understanding of the usual infecting flora,  available antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility patterns. the most common organisms in simple wound infection are gram-positive cocci and mainly staphylococcus aureus. staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus (quite often methicillin-resistant strains) are the organisms which predominate in the infectious complications following clean surgical procedures with implantation of vascular grafts or prosthetic devices. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora are mainly responsible for cases of intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections: the most common aerobes are enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus spp., and others) and enterococci, and among anaerobes bacteroides fragilis group prevails. adequate drainage and surgical control of the source of  infection, when needed, and adjunctive effective antimicrobial therapy are important factors in successful treatment of postoperative infections. semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillins and glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) are the drugs of choice for the treatment of infections caused by penicillin-resistant methicillin-sensitive, and methicillin-resistant, respectively, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for the treatment of intra-abdominal  and intra-pelvic infections, animal and human studies support the recommendation  that treatment should be directed against both gram-negative enteric and anaerobic bacteria. combinations of aminoglycosides with clindamycin or metronidazole have been widely used with great success; however adverse reactions such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have been a problem in some patients. in recent years monotherapy with either a carbapenem (imipenem/cilastatin or meropenem) or a penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination has been proposed. among these combination antimicrobials, piperacillin combined with tazobactam is a very well designed formulation. indeed, piperacillin is active against a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, and tazobactam is a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor which acts on a variety of clinically important plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. this combination seems particularly attractive for the treatment of mixed polymicrobial anaerobic-aerobic infections such as intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections.

TI  == t cells activated by zwitterionic molecules prevent abscesses induced by pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == immunologic paradigms classify bacterial polysaccharides as t cell-independent antigens. however, these models fail to explain how zwitterionic polysaccharides  (zps) confer protection against intraabdominal abscess formation in a t cell-dependent manner. here, we demonstrate that zps elicit a potent cd4+ t cell  response in vitro that requires available major histocompatibility complex class  ii molecules on antigen-presenting cells. specific chemical modifications to zps  show that: 1) the activity is specific for carbohydrate structure, and 2) the proliferative response depends upon free amino and carboxyl groups on the repeating units of these polysaccharides. peptides synthesized to mimic the zwitterionic charge motif associated with zps also exhibited these biologic properties. lysine-aspartic acid (kd) peptides with more than 15 repeating units  stimulated cd4+ t cells in vitro and conferred protection against abscesses induced by bacteria such as bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus. evidence for the biologic importance of t cell activation by these zwitterionic polymers was provided when human cd4+ t cells stimulated with these molecules in  vitro and adoptively transferred to rats in vivo conferred protection against intraabdominal abscesses induced by viable bacterial challenge. these studies demonstrate that bacterial polysaccharides with a distinct charge motif activate  t cells and that this activity confers immunity to a distinct pathologic response to bacterial infection.

AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == effects of surgery on mucosal pathologic changes following experimental sinusitis in rabbit.
AB  == in the present investigation, the regenerative capacity of the infected maxillary sinus mucosa following surgical procedures was studied in a rabbit model. sinusitis was induced by occluding the ostium with and without the addition of staphylococcus aureus or bacteroides fragilis, or by provoking a prolonged bacterial infection with both pathogens. the surgical procedures performed were 1) widening of the natural sinus ostium (middle meatal antrostomy; mma) and 2) removal of sinus mucosa without ostial interference (modified radical operation;  mro). the histologic features of the entire nose-sinus complex were studied, graded semiquantitatively, and compared with findings in untreated sinusitis, or  after surgery only. whereas mma and mro both led to a decrease of the inflammatory features of the sinus mucosa in induced sinusitis, persistent local  histopathology was observed in the ostial region following mma surgery. this indicates the importance of local pathologic changes resulting from interactions  of bacterial colonization, inflammation, and surgery in chronic sinusitis.

AB  == the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two multiple-dose regimens of piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h and 4.5 g every 8 h) were evaluated at steady state for 12 healthy adult volunteers. inhibitory and bactericidal activities for the two regimens were determined with five american type culture collection (atcc) organisms (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis). the percentage of  time that plasma concentrations remained above the mic (t > mic) for each organism and dosage regimen was calculated. areas under the inhibitory (auic0-24) and bactericidal activity (aubc0-24) curves were calculated with the trapezoidal  rule by using the reciprocal of the inhibitory and bactericidal titers determined for each dosage regimen. in order to assess the validity of predicted measures of bactericidal (auc0-24/mbc) and inhibitory (auc0-24/mic) activity to determine bacteriological response to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, auc0-24/mbc and auc0-24/mic values were compared with measured aubc0-24 and auic0-24 values. total body clearance values were equivalent for piperacillin (183.96 +/- 22.66 versus 181.72 +/- 19.54 ml/min/1.73 m2, p > 0.05) and tazobactam (184.71 +/- 19.89 versus 184.87 +/- 18.35 ml/min/1.73 m2, p > 0.05) following the administration of the 3.375-g-every-6-h and 4.5-g-every-8-h dosages, respectively. comparison of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc0-24) for piperacillin (967.74 +/- 135.56 microg x h/ml versus 978.88 +/- 140.96 microg x h/ml) and tazobactam (120.14 +/- 15.78 microg x h/ml versus 120.01 +/- 16.22 microg x h/ml) revealed no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the 3.375-g-every-6-h and 4.5-g-every-8-h regimens, respectively. both regimens provided t > mic values of > 60% for all organisms tested. measured values of bactericidal (aubc) and inhibitory (auic) activity were significantly different (p < 0.05) from predicted values (auc0-24/mbc and auc0-24/mic) for all  organisms studied with the exception of the bactericidal activity for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. additionally, atcc organisms possessing the same mics and mbcs exhibited great differences in measured aubc0-24 and auic0-24 values. reasons for this difference may be inherent differences in organism specific susceptibility.

TI  == [study of 112 patients with septic arthritis caused by pyogenic organisms and fungi: changes in the clinical spectrum during the last 2 decades].
AB  == a retrospective study of 112 patients with septic arthritis (sa) caused by pyogenic organisms and fungi attended at the same medical service from 1975 to 1994. this sa was more common among male patients and the age at onset of disease was 42 +/- 23.2 years. predisposing factors were identified in 53 patients, the more common being connective tissue diseases and parenteral drug abuse (pda). the main portal of entry was bacteremia from a distant infective source. the most common causative agents were grampositive cocci (particularly s. aureus) and the  more uncommon organisms were recovered from patients with underlying diseases. the diagnostic delay was 14.1 +/- 28.1 days. single joint sa occurred in 88% of patients. large joints were mainly involved. on admission, 25% of patients had no fever and only 54% of them had leukocytosis; therefore, the lack of these findings in a given patient with acute arthritis should not rule out the possibility of sa. initial therapy consisted of daily arthrocentesis and i.v. antibiotics. the mean duration of antibiotic therapy was 47 +/- 23 days; the duration of the i.v. route was 23 +/- 14 days. an eighty percent of patients recovered without functional sequelae. the 31 patients who required surgical drainage had a longer diagnostic delay and a worse evolution, thus stressing the  necessity of an early diagnosis. in the last decade (1986-1994) an increase in some predisposing factors (iatrogenic sa and pda), a shorter diagnostic delay, a  more prolonged antibiotic therapy, a smaller proportion of surgical drainage and  an ultimate evolution identical to that in the previous decade were observed.

TI  == differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  == the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these  differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher  levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.

TI  == microbiology of nonbullous impetigo.
AB  == our objective was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of nonbullous impetigo (ni) in children. we used a retrospective review of clinical  microbiology laboratory and patients' records. specimens were obtained from 40 patients with ni lesions and showed bacterial growth. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 24 patients (60%), strict anaerobic bacteria only in 5 patients (12.5%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 11 patients (27.5%). sixty-four isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen): 43 aerobic or facultative, and 21 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (29 isolates), group a beta hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) (13 isolates), and escherichia coli (1 isolate).  the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (12), pigmented prevotella spp. (5), fusobacterium spp. (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). single bacterial  isolates were recovered in 17 patients (42.5%), 13 of which were s. aureus. s. aureus alone or mixed with gabhs or peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all body sites. mixed flora of peptostreptococcus spp. with prevotella spp. or fusobacterium spp. was mostly found in infections of the head and neck, while e.  coli mixed with b. fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from one infection of the buttocks area. thirty-three organisms isolated from 32 patients  (80%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. this study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic microbiology of ni lesions.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == bactericidal activity of low-dose clindamycin administered at 8- and 12-hour intervals against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == twelve volunteers received 300 mg of clindamycin intravenously (i.v.) or orally (p.o.) administered every 8 h (q8h) or q12h by random assignment over four study  periods. serum bactericidal titers were determined for each regimen against two isolates each of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (one penicillin-sensitive isolate and one penicillin-resistant isolate), and bacteroides fragilis. the duration of measurable bactericidal activity over the dosing interval (expressed as a percentage of the dosing interval) was determined for each isolate. no significant differences in the duration of activity were observed between i.v. and p.o. regimens dosed according to the same interval (p > 0.05). all regimens provided bactericidal activity against s. pneumoniae for 100% of their respective dosing intervals. against b. fragilis, bactericidal activity  was observed for greater than 80% of the dosing interval for each of the regimens. although a statistically significant difference favoring the q8h i.v. regimen (p < 0.05) was detected, this difference is not believed to be clinically significant. the q8h and q12h regimens provided measurable bactericidal activity  against s. aureus for greater than 85 and 50% of the dosing intervals, respectively (p < 0.001). clindamycin dosed at 300 mg i.v. or p.o., q8h or q12h,  provides adequate coverage against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and b. fragilis.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mics <  or = 4 mg/l), with reduced activity against serratia spp. (mic90 = 32 mg/l). in common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic > 128 mg/l). faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for mrsa mics were raised (mic90 = 2 mg/l) compared with those for mssa (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l). faropenem was also found to be  active against streptococci, neisseria spp., enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis. of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and clostridium perfringens (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l). an increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem mics for morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l and for mrsa from 0.25-2 mg/l to 8 mg/l (a similar increase was not observed for mssa). the mics of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. mics for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. in hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases,  including tem-1, shv-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, tem-3 and tem-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus (nctc 11561).

AB  == the antibacterial activities of nitazoxanide and its main metabolite, tizoxanide, were tested against a broad range of bacteria, including anaerobes. metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, and clindamycin were used as positive controls. mics were determined by reference agar dilution methods. the 241 anaerobes were all inhibited by nitazoxanide, with the mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic90s) being between 0.06 and 4 mg/liter with the exception of those for propionibacterium species, for which the mic90 was 16 mg/liter. the mic90s of nitazoxanide were 0.5 mg/liter for the bacteroides fragilis group (80 strains), 0.06 mg/liter for clostridium difficile (21 strains), and 0.5 mg/liter for clostridium perfringens  (16 strains). metronidazole showed a level of activity comparable to that of nitazoxanide except against bifidobacterium species, against which it was poorly  active, and propionibacterium species, which were resistant to metronidazole. the other antibiotics showed various levels of activity against anaerobes, with imipenem along with nitazoxanide being the most active agents tested. tizoxanide  was less effective than nitazoxanide except against the b. fragilis group, against which its activity was similar to that of nitazoxanide. under aerobic conditions, nitazoxanide demonstrated poor activity against members of the family enterobacteriacae and pseudomonas, staphylococcus, and enterococcus species. the  same results were obtained when culture was performed under anaerobic conditions  with the notable exception of the results against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of nitazoxanide were in the range of 2 to 4 mg/liter for 34 clinical isolates of  s. aureus, 12 of which were methicillin resistant, while tizoxanide was not effective.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between july 1994 and june 1995].
AB  == isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from july  1994 to june 1995 were investigated by a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. one hundred and fifty-three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 143 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, both anaerobic gram-positive and-negative bacteria were predominant, and from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was highest, followed by that of staphylococcus aureus from both types of infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of streptococcus intermedius was highest from primary infections, but from postoperative infections anaerobic gram-positive bacteria was uncommon. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order. from  postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by serratia marcescens and e. coli. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. we have noticed that resistant strains against imipenem and ofloxacin were increasing among p. aeruginosa and resistant strains against cefazolin were  increasing among e. coli. mics of cefazolin against four out of 30 strains of e.  coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and mics of imipenem was higher than 50  micrograms/ml against 5 out of 22 strains of p. aeruginosa.

TI  == penetration of cefpodoxime into uterine and vaginal secretions from postpartum women after a single oral dose of cefpodoxime proxetil.
AB  == we evaluated the usefulness of cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr) in the treatment of puerperal infection and obtained the following results. (i) the susceptibilities  of 124 clinical isolates from 85 uterine lochia samples were determined. the mic  at which the growth of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis isolates was inhibited by 90% (mic90) was 0.39 micrograms/ml or less. the mic90 for staphylococcus aureus was 3.13 micrograms/ml. (ii) seven puerperal women received 200 mg of cpdx-pr orally. the cpdx concentration in the  lochias in the uterine cavity was not statistically different from that in the vagina, suggesting that the vaginal samples, which can be obtained more safely and aseptically, can be substituted for the uterine samples. the cpdx concentration in cubital venous blood reached a peak of 1.61 micrograms/ml at 3 hours after cpdx-pr administration. the cpdx concentration in the lochias gradually increased and reached a peak of 1.20 micrograms/ml in the uterine cavity and 1.27 micrograms/ml in the vagina at 5 h after drug administration and  gradually declined thereafter. these results suggest that cpdx-pr, with its good  transfer to the lochia and its potent antimicrobial activity, is a promising drug for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of puerperal infections caused by  susceptible organisms.

TI  == in vivo activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  == oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. u-100592 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and u-100766 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. mics were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective mics of u-100592 and u-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 4  and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2  micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. most strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (vana, vanb, and vanc resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and m. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. the  presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. the spontaneous mutation frequencies of s. aureus atcc 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for u-100592 and u-100766, respectively. serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.

TI  == bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == objective: to assess the bacteriology and beta-lactamase enzyme activity in aspirates of 10 acutely and 13 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses. results: the predominant organisms isolated in acute sinusitis were streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis, and those found in chronic sinusitis were prevotella species, fusobacterium species, and peptostreptococcus species. four beta-lactamase-producing organisms (blpos) were  isolated in four specimens (40%) obtained from acutely inflamed sinuses, and 14 blpos were recovered from 10 chronically inflamed sinuses (77%). the predominant  blpos in acute sinusitis were h influenzae, and m catarrhalis; those in chronic sinusitis were staphylococcus aureus, prevotella species, fusobacterium species,  and bacteroides fragilis. conclusions: beta-lactamase activity was detected in 12 (three in acute and nine in chronic sinusitis) of the 14 aspirates that contained blpos. the detection of beta-lactamase activity in sinus aspirates provides support for the role of blpos in the failure of penicillin therapy in sinusitis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == spinal epidural abscess in hemodialysis patients: report of three cases and review of the literature.
AB  == spinal epidural abscess (sea) is a rare infection that can evolve to severe permanent neurologic deficit or death if the diagnosis is delayed. we report three cases of sea in hemodialysis patients and summarize nine previously reported cases occurring in hemodialysis patients, with detailed comparisons to series of sea from the general medical literature. among these 12 patients, hemodialysis catheters and arteriovenous grafts were the major source of infection, in contrast to the usual skin source. staphylococcus aureus was implicated in all cases, but in one patient bacteroides fragilis also was isolated from both the resected arteriovenous fistula and the sea, and escherichia coli was isolated from the arteriovenous fistula. the classic syndrome of sea includes fever, backache, and local spinal tenderness, followed by progressive radicular and cord compression signs and symptoms. in this series, back pain and radicular pain were common at presentation, but only a minority had fever, back tenderness, weakness, or leukocytosis. cerebrospinal fluid was typically abnormal but culture negative, whereas blood and epidural abscess cultures were frequently positive. plain x-ray films, bone scans, and plain computed tomography scans had low diagnostic yield, and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium had a sensitivity of 80%. only myelography or computed tomography-myelography gave consistently correct diagnoses. the clinical outcome  was poor, with one patient deceased and seven with severe weakness or paralysis.  early intervention provided a higher likelihood of good outcome, whereas late intervention and preoperative neurologic deficits portended a poor functional result. because of the high incidence of bacteremia in hemodialysis patients, we  recommend that symptoms of fever, backache, and spinal tenderness be promptly evaluated for sea before signs or symptoms of cord compression develop. early recognition and treatment with antibiotics and decompressive laminectomy is generally associated with a better outcome.

AB  == the interesting in vitro antimicrobial activity and pharmacokinetics of the new quinolone trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) warranted further studies to determine its in vivo efficacy in models of infectious disease. the significance of the pharmacokinetic and in vitro antimicrobial profiles of trovafloxacin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models by employing primarily oral therapy. against acute infections, trovafloxacin was consistently more effective than temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens while maintaining activity comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative organisms. in a model of murine pneumonia, trovafloxacin was more efficacious than temafloxacin, while  ciprofloxacin failed against s. pneumoniae (50% protective doses, 2.1, 29.5, and  >100 mg/kg, respectively). in addition to its inherent in vitro potency advantage against s. pneumoniae, these data were supported by a pharmacokinetic study that  showed levels of trovafloxacin in pulmonary tissue of s. pneumoniae-infected cf1  mice to be considerably greater than those of temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin (twice the maximum drug concentration in serum; two to three times the half-life, and three to six times the area under the concentration-time curve). against localized mixed anaerobic infections, trovafloxacin was the only agent to effectively reduce the numbers of recoverable cfu of bacteroides fragilis ( >1,000-fold), staphylococcus aureus (1,000-fold), and escherichia coli ( >100-fold) compared with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, clindamycin, cefoxitin, and ceftriaxone. the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of  trovafloxacin and its pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals provide support for  the ongoing and planned human phase ii and iii clinical trials.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group a streptococci (five isolates), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates)  and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were s. aureus. sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. enteric gram-negative  rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. group a streptococci and s. aureus  predominated in finger and hand lesions. bacteroides fragilis group and clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented prevotella sp. and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. the polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.

TI  == multicenter clinical laboratory evaluation of a beta-lactamase disk assay employing a novel chromogenic cephalosporin, s1.
AB  == s1, a new chromogenic cephalosporin (international bioclinical, inc., portland, oreg.), was used to detect beta-lactamase production among a variety of commonly  encountered bacteria in a four-center collaborative study. results of an s1 disk  assay were compared with those obtained by a nitrocefin-based disk procedure (cefinase; becton-dickinson microbiology systems, cockeysville, md.), with repetitive testing of five quality control organisms and with individual tests of recent clinical isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae (162 strains), haemophilus influenzae (162 strains), moraxella catarrhalis (155 strains), staphylococcus aureus (161 strains), and bacteroides fragilis (164 strains). the performances of the two beta-lactamase disk assays were comparable for the first three species cited above. however, the s1 assay appeared to be a more sensitive procedure than the cefinase assay when applied to s. aureus and b. fragilis, with respect to both total numbers of positive results and length of time to a definitive positive endpoint.

TI  == a retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the wadsworth anaerobic bacteriology clinical research laboratory (los angeles). anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. a total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. the most common isolates were as follows: fusobacterium nucleatum (19); prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were p. oris); bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were b. fragilis); pigmented prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were peptostreptococcus micros); eubacterium species (7); lactobacillus species (8); actinomyces species (7); and  clostridium species (7). nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: f. nucleatum (five cases); b. fragilis (two cases); and prevotella mangus (one case). of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group d nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. the susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of  these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (mics ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/ml vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/ml for beta-lactamase-negative strains).

TI  == postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  == studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. the rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees c, ranged from 0.1 ng/ml/min for streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/ml/min for clostridium perfringens. the rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. ph had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing  temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. these data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

AB  == biological activities of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem were compared with respect to permeability into gram-negative bacteria, binding to penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), and hydrolysis by beta-lactamases. permeability for the three carbapenems was similar when measured in serratia marcescens s6 producing a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. penetration of the carbapenems was comparable with cephaloridine and faster than piperacillin or the extended spectrum cephalosporin cefotaxime. all the carbapenems bound most strongly to pbp 2 of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and to pbp 1 of staphylococcus aureus. in addition, biapenem showed strong affinity with pbp 1a of e. coli and pbp 1b of p. aeruginosa. selected serine beta-lactamases, including the extended spectrum plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, hydrolyzed these carbapenems at rates < 0.1% that of cephaloridine. metallo-beta-lactamases  hydrolysed the carbapenems at measurable rates, with enzymes from bacteroides fragilis and xanthomonas maltophilia hydrolyzing biapenem at lower vmax values than meropenem or imipenem. in conclusion, all the carbapenems exhibited good rates of penetration, bound strongly to pbps in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and were stable to most group 1 and group 2 serine beta-lactamases, but were hydrolyzed by metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluations of a-80556, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == a-80556 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. a-80556 was more active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. a-80556 was particularly active against staphylococcus aureus (mic for 90% of isolates [mic90], 0.12 microgram/ml, relative to fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml). a-80556 was also the most active of the quinolones tested against  ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, with an mic90 of 4.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was > 128 micrograms/ml. however, the significance of this activity is not known. a-80556 was slightly less active against escherichia coli (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml) and other enteric organisms than ciprofloxacin (mic90 for e. coli, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml). a-80556 was slightly less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml) than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 2.0  micrograms/ml) and more active against acinetobacter spp. (respective mic90s, 0.12 and 0.5 microgram/ml). a-80556 was also the most active compound against anaerobes. against bacteroides fragilis, the mic90 of a-80556 was 2.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was 16 micrograms/ml. the in vivo efficacy of a-80556 in experimental models with both gram-positive and gram-negative infections was consistent with the in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics and oral absorption in mice.

TI  == a bacteriologic basis for the evolution and severity of empyema.
AB  == the management of pediatric empyema remains controversial. an experimental study  was undertaken to evaluate the role of bacteria in the evolution and severity of  empyema, using specific bacteria that are pathogens of empyema in children. a rabbit model was used. the groups were haemophilus influenzae (n = 9), bacteroides fragilis (n = 8), the combination (n = 12), staphylococcus aureus (n  = 6), and control (n = 6). the total bacterial inoculum (10(8)) was constant. diagnostic thoracentesis was performed at regular intervals. characteristics of the empyema were evaluated when the rabbits were killed (at 4, 7, and 10 days). most rabbits other than those of the mixed-bacteria group cleared the bacteria from their pleural cavities. eleven of 12 mixed-bacteria animals had multiloculated empyemas; only one resolved spontaneously. in the other groups, the tendency was toward unilocular empyemas, which resolved by the 10th day in one third of the h influenzae animals, two thirds of the bacteroides fragilis animals, and half the s aureus animals. the empyemas that persisted until the 10th day were in the exudative or fibrinopurulent stage, except for those of the  mixed-bacteria group, all of which were in the advanced organizing stage. the amount of pleural debris and the degree of organization were significantly greater for the mixed bacteria group (p > .01). these findings support the clinical management of monobacterial empyema by simple drainage, whereas mixed aerobic-anaerobic empyemas may require more aggressive drainage procedures.

TI  == peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  == 680 peptostreptococcus sp. (ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. they included 103 ps asaccharolyticus, 74 ps magnus,  56 ps prevotii, 51 ps micros, 46 ps anaerobius, 11 ps morbilorum, and 10 ps saccharolyticus. most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), ps were recovered in pure culture. most ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. these were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). the organisms most commonly isolated with ps were bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 b. fragilis group), prevotella sp. (159), fusobacterium sp. (122), escherichia coli (114), and staphylococcus aureus (97). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. these data illustrate the importance of ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == induction of the release of prostaglandin e2 from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes by bacteroides fragilis: its possible role in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
AB  == the presence of anaerobic bacteria, especially of bacteroides (b.) fragilis, in abdominal abscesses, infected decubitus ulcera, and the infected foot of diabetic patients is well documented. the importance, however, of these microorganisms in  the pathogenesis of deep tissue infections has still to be evaluated. therefore,  the aim of this study was to evaluate the potency of b. fragilis as compared to aerobic bacteria widely known for causing inflammation, in inducing the release of prostaglandin e2 from polymorphonuclear granulocytes. prostaglandin e2 is a potent vasodilator and contributes to edema and erythema, which are part of the inflammatory response. furthermore, the camp-content of the neutrophils was determined after stimulation of the cells with the various bacteria. of the bacterial species tested, b. fragilis proved to be one of the most potent triggers for prostaglandin e2 release from neutrophils indicating a possible major role of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for polymyxin b (pl-b),  gentamicin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against clinically isolated microbial strains collected since november 1992, and the following conclusions were obtained: 1. judging from the mic distribution of pl-b against the studied strains including multi-drug resistant organisms of major strains of family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it appeared that no pl-b resistant strains were detected among those gram-negative organisms within the antimicrobial spectrum of pl-b. 2. mics of pl-b against most strains including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were distributed between 100 and 800 micrograms/ml. these results supported reports of other investigators that the eradication of staphylococcus spp. including mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) was possible by the use of pl-b at 1 mg/ml. 3.  mic distribution of pl-b against organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group was  almost the same as the results described above.

AB  == unilateral maxillary sinusitis was experimentally induced in new zealand white rabbits with streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3, bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343, and staphylococcus aureus v8. in another group of rabbits, sinusitis was induced  by blocking of the sinus ostium only. bacteriologic and light microscopic analysis was performed after 5 days to 1 month. granulation-like polyps developed after deep mucosal inflammatory trauma initiating fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and epithelial migration to cover the polyp. in regions of a more superficial trauma-characterized by epithelial desquamation and fibroblast growth-proliferation and differentiation of basal cells resulted in the formation of microcavities dissecting off edematous polyps. polyps could be found in all sinusitis groups, irrespective of inducing agent. the cellular events of polyp formation appear to be the result of a continuous inflammatory reaction and are not directly related to the presence of a certain microorganism. instead, the potential of any microorganism to induce a deep mucosal trauma or epithelial desquamation seems essential for its ability to initiate polyp formation.

AB  == the effect of inflammation and chronic sepsis on the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdh) in skeletal muscle was investigated in rats. inflammation was induced by the placement of a catheter in the carotid artery. sepsis was induced by repeated (every 48 hr) injections of an inoculum composed of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis organisms into a preformed subcutaneous abscess. hindlimb muscle was sampled 7 or 14 days following the initial injection of the inoculum into the abscess. total phd activity was not altered by any of the conditions examined. there were no differences in the proportion of active pdh complex after 7 days in any of the conditions examined. in contrast, 14 days after the initial bacterial injection,  the concentration of active pdh complex in skeletal muscle was reduced by 50% in  the septic rats. the combination of intravascular catheterization and infection resulted in a further decrease in the concentration of active pdh complex. the decreased concentration of active pdh complex was associated with increased plasma lactate concentrations in septic rats. catheterization exacerbated the rise in plasma lactate in sepsis. in this model of chronic sepsis, the magnitude  of the hyperlactatemia and the inhibition of the pdh complex in skeletal muscle appear dependent upon the length of time of the septic insult and are potentiated by addition of an intravascular focus of inflammation.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of t-3761, a new quinolone derivative.
AB  == t-3761, a new quinolone derivative, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. its mics for 90% of the strains tested were 0.20 to 100 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria, including members of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus; 0.025 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against gram-negative bacteria, including members of the family enterobacteriaceae and the genus haemophilus; 0.05 to 50 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, including members of the genera pseudomonas, xanthomonas, acinetobacter, alcaligenes, and moraxella; 0.025 micrograms/ml against legionella spp.; and 6.25 to 25 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, including bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and peptostreptococcus spp. the in vitro activity of t-3761 against these clinical isolates was comparable to or 2- to 32-fold greater than those of ofloxacin and norfloxacin and 2- to 16-fold less and 1- to 8-fold greater than those of ciprofloxacin and tosulfoxacin, respectively. when administered orally, t-3761 showed good efficacy in mice against systemic, pulmonary, and urinary tract infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including quinolone-resistant serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the in vivo activity of t-3761 was comparable to or greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and tosufloxacin against most infection models in mice. the activities of t-3761 were lower than those of tosufloxacin against gram-positive bacterial systemic and pulmonary infections in mice but not against infections with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the activities of t-3761 against systemic quinolone-resistant serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in mice were 2- to 14-fold greater than those of the reference agents.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == fk037 is a new parenteral cephalosporin, which offers some advantages over the commercially available parenteral cephalosporins. it demonstrated potent broad-spectrum activity against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa. against clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive bacteria, fk037, like cefpirome, demonstrated more potent activity  than ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. it is noteworthy that fk037, on the basis of the mic90s, was the most active of all the cephalosporins tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). it was similar in activity to cefpirome against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa). against clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, fk037, like cefpirome, was superior to cefoperazone, similar to ceftazidime and inferior to ceftizoxime in activity. against p. aeruginosa, fk037 was superior to cefoperazone, similar or slightly superior to cefpirome and inferior to ceftazidime in activity. however,  fk037 exhibited significant activity against citrobacter and enterobacter which were highly resistant to ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. fk037 had an  advantage in that its bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa at sub-mics (1/2 or 1/4 the mic) was much stronger than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. moreover, it exhibited potent bactericidal activity against mssa, mrsa and p. aeruginosa in a pharmacokinetic in vitro model simulating human plasma concentrations after intravenous dosage of 0.125, 1.0 and 1.0 g, respectively. fk037 inhibited essential penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), 1, 2 and 3 of s. aureus with a 50% inhibitory concentration (i50) of 0.58 micrograms/ml or lower. of essential pbps 3, 1a and 1b of e. coli and p. aeruginosa, fk037 inhibited pbp 3 at the lowest i50 (0.03 and 0.04 micrograms/ml, respectively) and pbps 1a and 1b with i50 values of 2.7 micrograms/ml or lower. fk037, like cefpirome, was highly stable to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases except ic cephalosporinase from bacteroides fragilis, and had extremely low affinity for beta-lactamases. therefore, fk037 was more potent than ceftazidime in activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria except p. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. the ability of fk037 to penetrate the outer membrane of e. coli was slightly higher than that of ceftazidime, but slightly lower than that of cefpirome.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == serum and blister fluid pharmacokinetics and bactericidal activities of ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotetan, cefoxitin, ceftizoxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
AB  == ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, cefotetan, and ceftizoxime are promoted for the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacterial infections. their activities have been compared in vitro but not in vivo. in order to assess the in vivo activities of these agents in serum and interstitial  fluid, we administered single, intravenous doses of these antimicrobial agents to healthy subjects. concentrations of the antimicrobial agents in serum and suction-induced blister fluid and bactericidal activity were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography and the standard methodology of the national  committee for clinical laboratory standards, respectively. the organisms used for bactericidal activity tests were one isolate each of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis. pharmacokinetic parameters in serum and blister fluid were similar to those derived in other investigations. of note were the high and prolonged concentrations of ticarcillin and cefotetan in blister fluid, despite high-level serum protein binding. the bactericidal activities in serum and blister fluid reflected the relative in vitro activities  and kinetic dispositions of the various antimicrobial agents except for the bactericidal activity of cefotetan, which was substantially lower in blister fluid than serum, despite a blister fluid:serum area under the concentration-time curve ratio of 1.5. similarly, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanate in blister fluid was also substantially less than would have been predicted by the blister fluid:serum ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve of 1.1, possibly because of the low concentrations of clavulanate in blister fluid. the rankings of the in vivo bactericidal activities of the five drugs were as follows: for s.  aureus, ampicillin-sulbactam > ticarcillin-clavulanate > ceftizoxime > cefoxitin  > cefotetan; for k. pneumoniae, ceftizoxime > cefotetan > ampicillin-sulbactam =  ticarcillin-clavulanate > cefoxitin; and for b.fragilis, ticarcillin-clavulanate  > cefotetan > ceftizoxime > ampicillin-sulbactam = cefoxitin.

AB  == a total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml) by agar dilution method. these included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), 31 of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 49 of neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of haemophilus influenzae, 112  of escherichia coli, 118 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of proteus mirabilis, 30 of proteus vulgaris, 60 of serratia marcescens, 113 of enterobacter cloacae, 60 of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of bacteroides fragilis. the results revealed that  46.6% of p. mirabilis, 53.4% of h. influenzae, 57.1% of n. gonorrhoeae, 80% of p. vulgaris, 83.9% of mrsa, 85.6% of mssa, 87.5% of e. coli, 91.7% of s. marcescens, 95.7% of b. fragilis, 98.2% of e. cloacae, and 100% of k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers.  the ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of mssa, mrsa, h. influenzae, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, e. cloacae, b. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of mssa, h. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of mrsa, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris and b. fragilis strains. clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of single-dose cefotetan used for antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of cefotetan were studied after a single injection of 2 g given intravenously for antimicrobial prophylaxis to 16 consecutive patients undergoing colorectal surgery. concentrations in tissue greater than or equal to the mic for 90% of the main pathogens tested were considered adequate. the elimination half-life at beta phase was 4.6 +/- 1.4 h, the total body clearance was 0.75 +/- 0.19 ml/kg/min, and the volume of distribution was 260 +/- 71 ml/kg. at the time of incision (33 +/- 16 min after the injection), cefotetan concentrations were 14.2 +/- 7 micrograms/g in abdominal-wall fat, 16.4 +/- 1 micrograms/g in epiploic fat, and 163 +/- 62 mg/liter in serum. at the time of surgical anastomosis (151 +/- 54 min), cefotetan concentrations were 33.3 +/- 6 micrograms/g in the colonic wall and 73  +/- 34 mg/liter in serum. upon closure of the abdomen (216 +/- 76 min), cefotetan concentrations were 6.3 +/- 3 micrograms/g in abdominal-wall fat, 6.1 +/- 4 micrograms/g in epiploic fat, and 64 +/- 38 mg/liter in serum. cefotetan tissue penetration was 10% into abdominal and epiploic fat and 46% into the colonic wall. levels in tissue were compared with the mic for 90% of the most frequently  encountered pathogenic germs (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli). adequate concentrations in tissue were obtained up to anastomosis but not upon closure. the authors therefore recommend the injection of an additional dose of 1 g before closure in order to ensure optimal efficacy throughout the surgical procedure.

TI  == platelet-activating factor modulates endotoxin-induced macrophage procoagulant activity by a protein kinase c-dependent mechanism.
AB  == macrophage procoagulant activity is an important mediator of extravascular fibrin deposition at sites of infection and appears to contribute to the pathogenesis of several infectious disease processes. previous studies have shown that the inflammatory mediator platelet-activating factor was able to prime macrophages for induction of procoagulant activity by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. the present studies were designed to examine the mechanism of this priming effect. platelet-activating factor (100 nm) primed macrophages for procoagulant activity  generation in response to endotoxin at concentrations as low as 100 ng/ml and also following exposure to escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and staphylococcus aureus. the priming effect occurred following a pretreatment with  platelet-activating factor for as short as 1 min, suggesting a rapid activation event. two different doses of the calcium ionophore ionomycin were used to mimic  the peak and sustained effects of platelet-activating factor on cytoplasmic calcium levels (1 microm and 100 nm, respectively). neither dose was able to mimic the priming effect. however, extracellular calcium was necessary for induction of procoagulant activity and the priming effect. by contrast, the protein kinase c agonist phorbol myristate acetate reproduced the priming phenomenon observed for platelet-activating factor. in further support of the concept that protein kinase c activation mediated the effect of platelet-activating factor, the specific protein kinase c inhibitor staurosporine reversed the ability of platelet-activating factor to augment induction of macrophage procoagulant activity by endotoxin. these data suggest mechanisms by which inflammatory mediators within the microenvironment of infection might modulate the host response to bacterial pathogens.

AB  == the efficacy of topical antiseptic therapy for wounds and skin ulcers has been shown to be at the expense of fibroblast and leukocyte function and, in general,  wound healing. specifically, continued fibroblast function after exposure to antiseptics has been correlated to the concentration of the antiseptic. at concentrations that preserve fibroblast function, 0.005% sodium hypochlorite, 0.001% providone-iodine, 0.0025% acetic acid, and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide were tested for their effectiveness against various clinical isolates. staphylococcus  aureus, escherichia coli, group d enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis were exposed to the antiseptics and plated in a standard microbiological fashion. the cultures showed that sodium hypochlorite inhibited the growth of all the bacteria (p less than 0.001), whereas povidone-iodine reduced the colonies of s. aureus and acetic acid inhibited p. aeruginosa. our study suggests that 0.005% sodium hypochlorite can be used as a debriding and topical antibacterial agent for wounds and skin ulcers without inhibiting fibroblast activity essential to normal wound repair.

TI  == autologous fibrin gel: bactericidal properties in contaminated hepatic injury.
AB  == fibrin glue is an effective hemostatic agent in a variety of clinical situations; its utility is limited by potential transmission of viral infection. we studied the bactericidal properties of fibrin gel (fg) in a murine contaminated hepatic injury model and in vitro by agar plate culture method. intra-abdominal abscess formation and adhesion rate were assessed following controlled liver injury in association with abdominal contamination with 10(7) bacteroides fragilis and hepatorrhaphy (h, n = 15) or fg (n = 12). animals treated by hepatorrhaphy had a  significantly greater intra-abdominal abscess rate (15/15 vs. 4/12, p less than 0.05) and adhesion rate (14/15 vs. 6/12, p less than 0.05) than animals treated with fg. fibrin gel is bactericidal to bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter faecium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus but has no effect against klebsiella pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa; the plasma component appears active. fibrin gel demonstrates significant improvement in adhesion formation and intra-abdominal abscess rate when compared with suture hepatorrhaphy. fibrin gel  appears protective in contaminated hepatic injury.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of e-1040, a novel thiadiazolyl cephalosporin compared with other parenteral cephems.
AB  == e-1040, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was tested against greater than 600 bacteremic pathogens and compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime,  and cefpirome. e-1040 activity against staphylococcus aureus was comparable (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) to ceftazidime, but inferior to cefotaxime (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml) and cefpirome (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). beta-hemolytic streptococci and most gram-positive anaerobes were also susceptible to e-1040. some strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci, all oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., enterococci, and bacteroides fragilis group strains were resistant to e-1040 (mic90, greater than 64 micrograms/ml). comparative tests for e-1040 and the three other cephalosporins against pseudomonads and nonenteric gram-negative bacilli showed e-1040 to be generally most active. the e-1040 mic90 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1 microgram/ml and for ceftazidime it was 4 micrograms/ml. haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp.  has e-1040 mic90s ranging from 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml. neisseria gonorrhoeae, strains resistant to penicillin, did not have markedly elevated e-1040 mics compared with penicillin-susceptible strains. enterobacteriaceae species had all  mics of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for e-1040 and cefpirome, indicating activity against strains producing stably derepressed beta-lactamases. e-1040 appeared to be beta-lactamase stable, little influenced by testing systems or media, and was bactericidal. e-1040 seems to have promise as a parenteral beta-lactam for use on strains resistant to "third-generation" cephalosporins and other families of drugs such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

TI  == management of infected aortoiliac aneurysms.
AB  == a 30-year retrospective review identified 13 patients treated for infected aneurysms of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries, for an overall incidence of 0.65%. a constellation of clinical findings led to the correct preoperative diagnosis in 11 (85%) of 13 patients. treatment methods included resection and in situ replacement grafting in seven patients, resection and extra-anatomic bypass  in five patients, and resection-ligation in one patient. four (31%) of 13 patients died within 30 days of operation, three of whom died of rupture. overall, good results were achieved in five patients (38%), while poor results were noted in the remaining eight patients (62%). the determinants of outcome were aneurysm location or rupture, the presence of established infection, and the virulence of the infecting organism. in 10 (77%) of the 13 aneurysms, salmonella  species, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa  accounted for all deaths, ruptures, and suprarenal aneurysm infections. these data suggest that patients with primary infections of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries continue to present with advanced infections or aneurysm rupture that result in a high mortality.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of gr69153, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin.
AB  == gr69153 is a c-7 catechol cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mics for 50% of strains tested [mic50s], 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic50, 4 micrograms/ml), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 0.25 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.03 micrograms/ml), neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50, 0.03 micrograms/ml), and acinetobacter spp. (mic50, 2 micrograms/ml). potent gr69153 activity was also demonstrated against moraxella catarrhalis, pneumococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, gram-positive anaerobes, and most species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. the activity of gr69153 was generally two- to fourfold greater than that of ceftazidime. resistance level gr69153 mics for 90%  of strains tested (greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) were found most often among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp. and morganella morganii strains. gr69153 did not significantly inhibit enterococci, xanthomonas maltophilia, the bacteroides fragilis group, corynebacterium jeikeium, or listeria monocytogenes. gr69153 was bactericidal and was generally beta-lactamase stable, and mics were only slightly increased by high inoculum concentrations. activity was enhanced in an iron-deficient medium, and a modest mic difference attributed to iron availability was noted between standard agar and broth test results. gr69153 was confirmed to be a potent, catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a spectrum slightly wider than that of ceftazidime, but it was less active than cefpirome or imipenem against some gram-positive pathogens and anaerobes.

TI  == synergy and antagonism of combinations with quinolones.
AB  == combinations of fluoroquinolones with other antimicrobial agents have been extensively investigated. combinations of fluoroquinolones with aminoglycosides,  beta-lactams, imidazoles, macrolides and clindamycin infrequently show synergy against enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive bacteria. these combinations rarely  show antagonism. combinations of rifampin with fluoroquinolones tested against staphylococcus aureus have been reported to show synergy and antagonism, and in vitro results have not correlated with results of animal infection experiments. against pseudomonas aeruginosa combinations of antipseudomonas penicillins or imipenem with fluoroquinolones are synergistic for 20% to 50% of isolates in vitro and also are synergistic in animal models of infection, whereas combinations of aminoglycosides with fluoroquinolones rarely show synergy against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against anaerobic species such as bacteroides fragilis combinations of fluoroquinolones with clindamycin, anti-anaerobic penicillins, cephalosporins or imidazoles are occasionally synergistic but usually indifferent. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin combined with antituberculosis agents have activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria. in general, fluoroquinolones should be combined with other agents not to achieve synergy, which is extremely variable, but to provide activity against bacteria inadequately inhibited by the fluoroquinolones.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == bacterial killing in vitro by abscess-derived neutrophils.
AB  == in the absence of antimicrobial therapy, bacteria such as bacteriodes fragilis, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis may persist within an intra-abdominal abscess in the presence of large numbers of neutrophils which, under optimal conditions in vitro, can readily phagocytose and kill the same bacterial strains. neutrophils taken from abscesses induced by gram-negative bacteria such as those  above contain viable organisms. on incubation in vitro in the presence of serum,  these neutrophils kill the bacteria phagocytosed in the abscess poorly, if at all, yet can readily kill organisms added in vitro. to determine possible mechanisms that might explain this, we examined the bactericidal activity in vitro of neutrophils from a range of abscesses induced by one or two species of bacteria plus an abscess-potentiating agent, bran. the organisms studied were b.  fragilis, e. coli, p. mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. the killing in vitro of e. coli and p. mirabilis, engulfed within an abscess, was significantly less than that of the same organisms when they were added to the in-vitro assay. in contrast, the killing of s. aureus was similar, whether engulfed in vivo or in vitro. however, s. aureus was less susceptible to phagocytosis and killing in vitro than p. mirabilis or e. coli, and the killing of s. aureus during in-vitro  incubation of neutrophils that had engulfed the organism with in the abscess was  similar to that of the gram-negative bacteria engulfed within the abscess.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antibiotics and expression of microbial virulence factors: implications for host  defense.
AB  == the discovery that antibiotics are capable of modifying both the structural appearance and physiology of pathogenic bacteria when they are incorporated in the culture medium at sub-growth inhibitory concentrations, has led to numerous examples in which the expression of one or more virulence factors (both structural and soluble) is inhibited or potentiated--some of these bacterial products are recognized in their own right as substances which can interfere with one or more stages of the normal process of phagocytosis viz, chemotaxis and staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin; opsonization and m protein of streptococcus pyogenes; phagocytic ingestion and capsule of bacteroides fragilis; phagocytic killing and streptolysin o of streptococcus pyogenes. exposure to these bacteria  to low concentrations of various chemotherapeutic drugs can alter the efficacy of the phagocytic process. however, many examples exist in which no specific biochemical lesion induced by exposure to the antibiotic has been recognized. by  way of contrast some recent experimental studies using genetically defined variants of s. aureus expressing protein a, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin or coagulase  have allowed some discrimination as to the specifity of the drug action and the relative role of each virulence factor in bacterial pathogenicity. in particular  it can be recognized that the presence or absence of protein a either through drug treatment (clindamycin or fusidic acid) or through gene delation is critical in determining bacterial susceptibility to opson-ophagocytosis. extension of these studies to in vivo models will shed light on possible antibiotic-host defence interaction during chemotherapy.

TI  == effects of beta-lactamase-mediated antimicrobial resistance: the role of beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  == production of beta-lactamase is the most common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. virtually all bacteria have the capability of synthesizing the enzyme. microorganisms may already possess the native genetic information necessary for beta-lactamase production (i.e., chromosomal), or may acquire the capacity by transfer of dna from another organism (i.e., plasmid-mediated). the level of beta-lactamase production may be stable and noninducible (constitutive enzyme production), or may be stimulated on exposure to selected beta-lactam antibiotics (inducible enzyme production). inhibitors such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam prevent antibiotic degradation by the beta-lactamases of many clinically significant pathogens. therefore, currently available beta-lactam-beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations exhibit broad spectra of in vitro activity. ticarcillin-clavulanate possesses clinically significant activity against many bacteria, including streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and numerous enterobacteriaceae. amoxicillin-clavulanate and ampicillin-sulbactam demonstrate clinically significant activity against streptococci (including enterococci), s. aureus, b. fragilis, and some enterobacteriaceae. ticarcillin-clavulanate is indicated for treatment of serious infections, including septicemia. amoxicillin-clavulanate is useful in the treatment of upper respiratory, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections. ampicillin-sulbactam may be used for treatment of intraabdominal, gynecologic, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == the viability of microorganisms in preservation solutions.
AB  == in 1988 the university of wisconsin solution was introduced into clinical transplantation. this solution is unique in that it contains no glucose but rather raffinose, lactobionate, and hydroxyethyl starch. in addition, it contains two antibiotics, penicillin and bactrim. prior studies have shown that other preservation solutions allow the transmission of bacterial contamination from organ donor to recipient. however, there are no data on whether uw solution, with its unique composition and extended preservation times, allows bacterial transmission. we undertook the present study to establish if bacteria remain viable in uw solution at extended preservation times. cultures of both aerobic (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and anaerobic (bacteroides fragilis) bacteria were suspended at 10(5), 10(4), 10(2), and 10(1) org./ml (calibrated from a .5 macfarland turbidity standard) in both eurocollins and uw preservation solutions. samples were then stored in an ice bath to stimulate organ preservation. the organisms were removed and plated on blood and chocolate agar at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hr postsuspension. the samples were then incubated at 37 degrees c and read for growth at 24-48 hr after plating. our results showed growth of all organisms except s epi in both preservation solutions, at all dilutions and preservation times. s epi grew in the eurocollins solution at all dilutions and preservation times but did not grow in the uw solution. when the experiment was repeated omitting penicillin from the uw solution, s epi grew at all dilutions and preservation times. these results demonstrate that in spite of the inclusion of two different antibiotics, the majority of the common bacterial contaminants of the organ donor remain viable in uw solution with extended preservation times. it may be possible therefore to omit these antibiotics from the uw solution and obtain similar results. it is also important to note that routine culturing remains an expensive but necessary part of organ procurement and preservation.

TI  == the role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in obstetrical and gynecological infections.
AB  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is a polymicrobial infection that evolves multiple aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. several of the bacterial pathogens that  participate in pid can produce the enzyme beta lactamase. these include bacteroides species (including bacteroides bivius, bacteroides disiens, and bacteroides fragilis group), neisseria gonorrheae, enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus. a recent increase in numbers of beta-lactamase-producing strains of these organisms in pid has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of this infection. these organisms cannot only survive penicillin therapy but also protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all of these pathogens in the therapy of pid.

AB  == we evaluated the combination of ofloxacin with piperacillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, rifampin, clindamycin, and metronidazole by the checkerboard agar dilution method against 165 isolates which included escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and citrobacter perfringens. synergy of piperacillin-ofloxacin was demonstrated for 50% and 40% respectively of e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa. some ofloxacin and  piperacillin-resistant isolates were susceptible with the combination. ofloxacin-gentamicin was indifferent for aerobic gram-negative species. ofloxacin and vancomycin or gentamicin was indifferent for s. aureus and e. faecalis, but rifampin-ofloxacin showed addition. combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole or clindamycin or erythromycin was indifferent for aerobic and anaerobic species. ofloxacin could be combined with piperacillin with benefit against p. aeruginosa, but combination with aminoglycosides is not of benefit.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.

TI  == occlusive dressings. does dressing type influence the growth of common bacterial  pathogens?
AB  == we studied the effect of different occlusive dressings and of air exposure on the growth of four pathogenic bacteria in wounds. partial-thickness wounds on domestic pigs were inoculated with staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. each wound was covered with three dressings (duoderm, opsite, or vigilon), or left exposed to air. groups of wounds were sampled at 24, 48, and 72 hours. staphylococcus aureus reached high levels beneath all of the dressings and in the air-exposed wounds. the numbers of c perfringens and b fragilis were greatly reduced in the air-exposed wounds and slightly reduced in the opsite-covered wounds. the numbers of p aeruginosa were greatest in the opsite- and vigilon-covered wounds. the results indicate that occlusive dressings are not indicated in wounds that clinically appear to be grossly contaminated or that may contain anaerobic organisms.

TI  == cardiac dysfunction in a rat model of chronic bacteremia.
AB  == cardiac function was examined in vivo and in vitro in rats to determine if cardiac dysfunction could be demonstrated in a nonlethal model of infection. bacteremic rats (n = 6) had a subcutaneous polymicrobial abscess produced via repeated inoculations of an encapsulated foreign body with escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and staphylococcus aureus while control rats (n = 6) had the same subcutaneous, encapsulated foreign body (an inflammatory focus) but were not inoculated with bacteria. cardiovascular function was assessed indirectly in  vivo by measuring the maximal o2 uptake during a progressive exercise test in both groups before and 14 days after the initiation of inoculations. cardiac function was also assessed in vitro in the same rats by measuring stroke volumes  generated at six different preloads with constant heart rate and afterload. bacteremic rats had a significantly different fever curve and leukocytotic response than control rats over the 14 day period. the majority of rats that received inoculations demonstrated bacteremias, while none of the control animals had positive cultures for the inoculated organisms. although in vivo assessment of cardiovascular function showed no evidence of dysfunction, in vitro assessment demonstrated a significant rightward shift of the starling curve in bacteremic rats. these data suggest that lv dysfunction occurs even during nonlethal infections but may be masked in vivo by compensatory mechanisms.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ljc10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of  imipenem and ceftazidime. ljc10,627 had broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. the mics of this compound for  90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested (mic90s), including strains resistant to ceftazidime, ranged from 0.1 to 25 micrograms/ml. ljc10,627  inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa at an mic90 of 3.13 micrograms/ml; it thus was twofold more active than imipenem. this compound inhibited haemophilus, neisseria, and branhamella species at mic90s of 3.13, 0.1, and 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. ljc10,627 was two- to fourfold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at mic90s of 0.1 and 0.39 microgram/ml. however, the compound was found to be twofold more active than imipenem against bacteroides fragilis at an mic90 of 1.56 microgram/ml. ljc10,627 was very stable to various beta-lactamases except for xanthomonas maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type ii. ljc10,627 was minimally hydrolyzed by swine renal dehydropeptidase i; its residual activity was 93.0% after 2 h. killing kinetics of this compound for escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that bactericidal action occurred at concentrations above the mic (0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively). ljc10,627 had a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 1b(s) of escherichia coli and  pseudomonas aeruginosa and penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of staphylococcus  aureus.

TI  == disparate mechanisms of induction of procoagulant activity by live and inactivated bacteria and viruses.
AB  == this study describes the dose response, time course, and lymphocyte requirements  of procoagulant activity (pca) induction following stimulation of thioglycolate-elicited balb/c peritoneal macrophages with live and inactivated bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and  murine hepatitis virus type 3 (mhv-3). induction of pca by mhv-3 was significantly more rapid and the maximal pca achieved was significantly greater than by the three bacterial species studied. in relation to induction of pca by bacteria, the pca response was more rapid and of greater magnitude with s. aureus and e. coli than with b. fragilis. mhv-3 induced an augmented pca response at all concentrations of virus studied in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas higher titers of live bacteria (greater than 10(7) cfu/ml) inhibited pca, suggesting the production of an inhibitory factor. significant pca induction was observed when macrophages were incubated with bacteria or virus in the absence of lymphocytes.  at low titers of b. fragilis (10(3) cfu/ml), addition of lymphocytes greatly augmented pca production, whereas at higher titers (10(7) cfu/ml), the addition of lymphocytes only slightly augmented the pca response. in contrast, mhv-3 induction of pca was enhanced by the addition of lymphocytes at all concentrations of virus studied, suggesting a lymphocyte-dependent process. heat-inactivated bacteria were as effective as live bacteria in inducing pca, suggesting that induction of pca by bacteria requires only a bacterial surface component. in contrast, uv-inactivated mhv-3 did not induce pca, suggesting that  viral replication is a necessary step in pca induction. these results suggest that the cellular and metabolic requirements for induction of pca differ among viral and bacterial pathogens and may partly explain their differences in pathogenicity.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, and regression curve].
AB  == this study was set up to establish the regression curve for clarithromycin inhibition zone diameters (disks 15 micrograms) and mic to create a strain distribution plot, in order to allow accurate interpretation of the disk diffusion method for testing susceptibility to clarithromycin. 430 bacterial strains were studied in three university hospital. clarithromycin was active against erythromycin sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci at concentrations of 0.12 to 0.25 microgram/ml (mode 0.25). erythromycin resistant strains were also resistant to clarithromycin. enterococci could be divided into two populations, one resistant (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml) and the other with mic of 0.06 to 2 (mode 0.25). this was also the case for streptococci and pneumococci with mic lower for susceptible strains (mode 0.03 to 0.06). clarithromycin was active on haemophilus at concentrations of 4 to 64 micrograms/ml (mode 16); mics for beta-lactamase producing strains were comparable to those of strains not producing. mics for neisseria were 0.12 to 16 and for b. catarrhalis 0.016 to 0.5. mic were 0.5 and 1 (mode 1) for clostridium perfringens; bacteroides fragilis strains were inhibited by 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml (mode 0.5-1). so, antibacterial activity of c was similar to that of e; it was sometimes slightly superior, particularly on gram positive cocci. for mic breakpoints of 1 and 4 micrograms/ml, zone size breakpoints should be 23  and 17 mm and for 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, 20 and 15 mm.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

TI  == implications of beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations.
AB  == resistance of many species of bacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics is mediated via inactivation by beta-lactamase. beta-lactamase inhibitors irreversibly bind to beta-lactamases and thus can prevent the destruction of active beta-lactam antibiotics. in the united states three beta-lactam-antibiotic/beta-lactam-inhibitor combinations are commercially available--the orally absorbed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (a/c), the parenteral  formulations of ampicillin/sulbactam (a/s) and ticarcillin/clavulanate (t/c). in  a multicenter study that focused on t/c, the in vitro activity of amoxicillin (amox), ampicillin (amp) and ticarcillin (tic) against neisseria gonorrhoeae and  haemophilus influenzae was obliterated when beta-lactamase-positive strains were  tested, but all tested strains were susceptible to the antibiotics in combination with their respective beta-lactamase inhibitors. clavulanic acid improved the activity of tic against most species of enterobacteriaceae but not against those  enterobacteriaceae that elaborate type i beta-lactamase or against non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negative bacilli (except for pseudomonas maltophilia). staphylococci are generally beta-lactamase positive and considered  resistant to amp and tic, but greater than 99% of 1,137 staphylococcus aureus isolates and 92% of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to t/c, with comparable figures obtained for a/c and a/s. the activity of tic against bacteroides fragilis was improved up to 64-fold by clavulanic acid, with  a definite but less pronounced effect on the non-fragilis bacteroides species. ninety-seven percent of strains of other anaerobic genera were susceptible to both tic and t/c.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == correlation of the extravascular pharmacokinetics of azithromycin with in-vivo efficacy in models of localized infection.
AB  == infection models were used to clarify the roles of serum and extravascular concentrations in the in-vivo efficacy observed with azithromycin. in-vivo experiments were designed to give serum concentrations well below the mic and tissue levels generally above the mic at time of challenge and during the course  of infection. the efficacy of azithromycin against a salmonella enteritidis oral  challenge (a tissue-associated infection model) in mice correlated directly with  azithromycin liver levels, but not serum concentrations. the significance of extravascular pharmacokinetics was observed in a comparative study of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin against the salmonella challenge. ciprofloxacin has a greater than 100-fold in-vitro potency advantage over azithromycin against  this organism, but azithromycin (5 mg/kg) produced a greater reduction in cfu than ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg) at the primary site of infection (liver). in another model, extravascular fluid levels, measured by bioassay of implanted paper discs, were compared with plasma levels in relation to control of a localized staphylococcus aureus infection in rats. extravascular fluid levels of  azithromycin were greater than the mic of the strain used for five days after a 100 mg/kg dose, while erythromycin levels were less than 20% of the mic at 30 h after a 200 mg/kg dose. serum concentrations of both compounds were less than 20% of the mic at the time of challenge. the antibiotic levels at the site of infection correlated with the reduction of staph. aureus cfu (99% with azithromycin compared with controls, p less than 0.01; 0% with erythromycin) recovered from inoculated discs. the significance of extravascular concentrations of azithromycin was further supported in other models of localized infections induced with escherichia coli or a mixture of staph. aureus and bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == splenic abscess: presentation, treatment options, and results.
AB  == pyogenic splenic abscess is a rare condition that tends to occur in patients with predisposing factors. the use of splenectomy or computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage in 10 patients with splenic abscess is presented. in 8 of 10 cases, the diagnosis was based on abdominal computed tomography scan. seven of 10 patients were treated with splenectomy, and 3 were managed with computed tomography-guided drainage. abscess cultures included escherichia coli, enterobacter, streptococcus viridans, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis. there were two morbidities and one death in the splenectomy group and no complications in those treated with percutaneous drainage. this review suggests a flexible approach in the management of splenic abscess. although splenectomy remains the traditional treatment for bacterial splenic abscess, ct-guided drainage may be appropriate in carefully selected patients.

TI  == effect of the abscess environment on the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the present studies were conducted to identify factors in human purulent material that might limit or enhance the activity of ciprofloxacin against bacteria causing suppurative infection. ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and ampicillin were tested with regard to binding or inactivation by pus. the bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were tested against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or staphylococcus aureus in human pus with a  ph of 6.0 incubated at 37 degrees c under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. the effect of single or combination drug therapy with 20 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or rifampin given every 12 hours was tested against e. coli or p. aeruginosa in polymicrobic murine abscesses that had been produced by subcutaneous injection of either of those organisms mixed with bacteroides fragilis and autoclaved human stool. antibiotic levels and the number of bacteria surviving in pus were quantitated. therapy of subcutaneous abscesses was delayed  72 hours to test drug efficacy against organisms in well-established infections.  levels of ampicillin, imipenem, or ciprofloxacin were reduced from 10 micrograms/ml to 3.1 +/- 4.0, 2.7 +/- 3, or 5.8 +/- 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, after incubation in eight pus specimens for 24 hours at 37 degrees  c. ampicillin levels were reduced to less than 1 microgram/ml in four pus specimens containing beta-lactamase. imipenem levels were undetectable in two specimens and were 0.2 micrograms/ml in one specimen. ciprofloxacin binding to pus supernate or sediment appeared to be explained by its binding to the deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) present in pus. activity of 5 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin against four e. coli or k. pneumoniae strains in pus in vitro was greater than that of twofold higher concentrations of imipenem. the bactericidal  activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were comparable but substantially reduced  against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa in pus. ciprofloxacin alone or regimens combining ciprofloxacin with rifampin or rifampin plus imipenem reduced the number of e. coli in polymicrobic subcutaneous abscesses but had little effect on p. aeruginosa in polymicrobic abscesses. the anaerobic abscess milieu appeared to inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin activity in abscess fluid did  not appear to be adversely affected by acid ph, aerobic or anaerobic conditions of incubation, the abscess constituents, or the binding of ciprofloxacin to the dna in pus. ciprofloxacin was bound to dna of bacterial or human origin. binding  by pus was reversible, and binding to dna extracts of pus was blocked by pretreatment of extracts with deoxyribonuclease but not by pretreatment with ribonuclease.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [bacteremia secondary to decubitus ulcer].
AB  == we have prospectively evaluated 16 episodes of bacteremia induced by decubitus ulcers. the most commonly isolated microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis. bacteremia was polymicrobial in 5 cases (31%). most ulcers were already present at the time  of admission, but bacteremia developed within the hospital in 13 patients. in 3 patients, ulcers did not show local features of infection. the initial antibiotic therapy was satisfactory in 13 cases. mortality rate directly associated with bacteremia was 18%, but the overall mortality rate was 62%. we did not identify data permitting a reliable prediction of the findings of blood culture; therefore, the initial empirical therapy should be active against staphylococcus  aureus, pseudomonas, enteric gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes including bacteroides fragilis.

AB  == blood cultures with strains of aerobic, facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria were studied by quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early  diagnosis of bacteraemias. small amounts of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids  were detected in uninoculated blood cultures. bacteroides fragilis produced acetic (27.6 mumol/ml), propionic (1.0 mumol/ml), isovaleric, (0.6 mumol/ml), lactic (4.5 mumol/ml) and succinic (2.7 mumol/ml) acids after 48 h. blood cultures inoculated with clostridium perfringens and fusobacterium nucleatum produced large amount of butyric acid (2.5 and 18.8 mumol/ml respectively) along  with acetic, propionic, lactic and succinic acids on day 2 of incubation. blood cultures with escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (group a) produced only acetic, lactic and succinic  acids. pseudomonas aeruginosa produced only small amounts of succinic (0.6 mumol/ml) and acetic acids (2.4 mumol/ml) on day 5 of incubation. blood cultures  inoculated with anaerobic bacteria produced multiple volatile fatty acids within  24 to 48 h of incubation. since these acids could be detected earlier than the organism in cultures, they may be useful in the early diagnosis of anaerobic bacteraemias/septicaemias.

TI  == in vitro activity of at-4140 against clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  == the activity of at-4140, a new fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared with those of existing analogs. at-4140 had a broad spectrum and a potent activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including legionella spp. and bacteroides fragilis. the activity of at-4140 against gram-positive and -negative cocci, including acinetobacter calcoaceticus, was higher than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. its activity against gram-negative rods was generally comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. some isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic of methicillin, greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) were resistant to existing quinolones, but many of them were still susceptible to at-4140 at concentrations below 0.39 micrograms/ml. the mics of at-4140, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin for 90% of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 0.2, 12.5, 6.25, and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. at-4140 was bactericidal for each of 20 clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations near the mics. at-4140 inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrase from e. coli.

TI  == comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitors tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam.
AB  == tazobactam (ytr-830h), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with clavulanic acid and sulbactam for enhancement of the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing, piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates. piperacillin mics were determined in media containing a fixed concentration of 2  or 4 micrograms of the inhibitors per ml. the higher concentration was generally  more effective. tazobactam was superior to sulbactam in enhancing the spectrum and potency of piperacillin. although the calvulanic acid combination was more potent, tazobactam was effective for a similar spectrum of resistant gram-negative clinical isolates containing beta-lactamase. mics were reduced to the susceptible range for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp.,  salmonella spp., and shigella spp. combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam, but not clavulanic acid, were effective against morganella spp. some antagonism of the activity of piperacillin was observed with clavulanic acid but not with tazobactam or sulbactam. the inhibitors were similarly effective with piperacillin against beta-lactamase-positive staphylococcus spp. and the bacteroides fragilis group. piperacillin-tazobactam was more effective against a  broader spectrum of gram-negative enteric bacteria than ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was. combinations with tazobactam or clavulanic acid had a broader spectrum of activity than combinations with sulbactam against bacteria that produce characterized plasmid-mediated enzymes of clinical significance. in  particular, piperacillin with tazobactam or clavulanic acid, but not with sulbactam, inhibited tem-1, tem-2, and shv-1 enzymes. in vitro activity was reflected in vivo. tazobactam and clavulanic acid were superior to sulbactam in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of piperacillin in mice infected with beta-lactamase-positive e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. only combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam were effective against the morganella infection. tazobactam has a good potential for enhancing the clinical efficacy of piperacillin.

TI  == the role of beta-lactamase in mixed infections in mice in relation to treatment with ampicillin.
AB  == beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis in a localized mixed infection has been found to degrade the beta-lactam antibiotic at the focus of infection, thus protecting both the bacteria and pathogens susceptible to the antibiotic. to determine if beta-lactamase produced by hemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis have similar importance in mixed infections, a thread infection model in mice was used to evaluate the capacity of beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus, b. catarrhalis, or h. influenzae to hydrolyze ampicillin in a mixed infection with streptococcus pneumoniae in mice. for both s. aureus and b. catarrhalis, the ampicillin concentrations at infection sites where beta-lactamase was produced were lower than at sites where beta-lactamase was not produced; however, this difference was not found when clavulanic acid was added to the ampicillin. in mixed infections with strains that did not produce beta-lactamase, ampicillin concentrations were  similar with or without clavulanic acid. s. aureus was the best "protector" followed by b. catarrhalis. the beta-lactamase produced by h. influenzae failed to protect the s. pneumoniae. no bactericidal effect of clavulanic acid was found.

AB  == infections in the diabetic host have been shown to persist longer than those in the nondiabetic host. to investigate whether intra-abscess milieu might be a contributing factor to this persistence, the in vivo intra-abscess ph was measured in induced soft-tissue abscesses in diabetic and nondiabetic mice. two models (female genetically obese insulin-resistant and male streptozocin-induced  diabetic mice) were used with appropriate controls. the bacteria injected to produce the soft-tissue abscesses were bacteroides fragilis and enterococcus (b + e), staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus (s + e), and s. aureus (sa). intra-abscess ph measured on day 3 was consistently and significantly lower in all diabetic mice compared with their controls. in the diabetic mice, the ph of an abscess induced with b + e, s + e, and sa was 6.28 (n = 17), 6.79 (n = 10), and 6.52 (n = 10), respectively; the ph in the controls was 7.21 (n = 20), 7.30 (n = 10), and 7.17 (n = 10), respectively. differences in all groups between diabetic and nondiabetic mice were significant. the blood glucose values of the diabetic mice averaged 722 mg/dl, and in the nondiabetic mice were 210 mg/dl. no  animals were ketotic. there were no significant differences in total colony counts between any groups. in conclusion, there is a significantly lower ph in the abscess of the diabetic host compared with the nondiabetic host that is not related to the numbers or types of causative bacteria.

AB  == the inoculum effect (ie) is a laboratory phenomenon that is described as a significant increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic when the number of organisms inoculated is increased. the ie generally occurs with beta-lactam antibiotics in relation to beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. an ie occurs with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins against staphylococcus aureus and less often with the quinolones, beta-lactam-resistant penicillins, cefoxitin, and aminoglycosides. an ie occurs with the penicillins against the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species, and a variable ie occurs  with cephalosporins; however, no ie occurs with aminoglycosides, quinolones, imipenem, and chloramphenicol against these organisms. an ie occurs with beta-lactam antibiotics against haemophilus influenzae and with the penicillins and the cephalosporins against penicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhoeae and  branhamella catarrhalis. an ie occurs with the penicillins and cephalosporins against the bacteroides fragilis group; no ie occurs with cefoxitin and imipenem. although certain antibiotics exhibit an ie, they are still capable of eradicating infections when administered appropriately. thus, the clinical significance of this laboratory phenomenon has yet to be elucidated.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == activities and sources of beta-lactamase in sputum from patients with bronchiectasis.
AB  == beta-lactamase activity was measured in secretions from patients with bronchiectasis. of 28 sputum samples, 23 contained measurable amounts of activity; values were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in purulent samples than in mucoid or mucopurulent samples. beta-lactamase activity was usually present in saliva collected before and between sputum expectorations, although values for sputum were higher than for either group of saliva samples (p less than 0.025 and p less than 0.005, respectively). this difference suggests that at least part of sputum beta-lactamase activity originates in the bronchial tree. detailed microbiological study of a further eight specimens (seven were beta-lactamase positive) led to the isolation of haemophilus influenzae from six, although only two of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive. several other beta-lactamase-producing organisms were also isolated, including staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), escherichia coli (n = 1), proteus spp. (n = 1), and bacteroides spp. (n = 3). size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography of the sputum showed several peaks of beta-lactamase activity which usually coeluted in fractions similar to those of their beta-lactamase-positive isolates. therefore,  sources of sputum beta-lactamases are often bacteria not considered truly pathogenic or not isolated during routine bacteriological assessment. these observations should be considered when embarking on antimicrobial therapy in bronchiectatic patients and suggest that increased dosages of penicillins are indicated.

TI  == the role of glycocalyx in surface phagocytosis of bacteroides spp., in the presence and absence of clindamycin.
AB  == the influence of isolated glycocalyx from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and b. fragilis on surface phagocytosis of clindamycin-treated and -untreated homologous and heterologous species was studied. when homologous or heterologous isolated glycocalyx was added to clindamycin-treated b. thetaiotaomicron or b. fragilis before incubation with pmnl, phagocytosis was reduced to levels observed in the untreated control bacteria, but addition of glycocalyx to untreated control strains showed no reduction of phagocytosis. when isolated bacteroides-glycocalyx was added to staphylococcus aureus or s. epidermidis, phagocytosis of both clindamycin-treated and -untreated bacteria was significantly reduced. the isolated glycocalyx preparations were analysed by thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography; these preparations were free of lipopolysaccharides. the isolated glycocalyx did not affect pmnl viability. our findings suggest that the glycocalyx is an important virulence factor because it impairs phagocytosis of bacteroides spp. by pmnl. clindamycin may enhance opsonophagocytosis of bacteroides by altering the glycocalyx.

TI  == comparative inhibitory and bactericidal activities of fce 22101 against gram-positive cocci and anaerobes in vitro.
AB  == the inhibitory activity of penem fce 22101 was compared with those of imipenem and other relevant antibiotics against over 500 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and anaerobes. the relative bactericidal activities of fce 22101 and imipenem were compared by a killing curve method. fce 22101 showed good inhibitory activity against most aerobic gram-positive cocci although generally less than imipenem. a substantial number of staphylococcus aureus isolates (43%)  were highly susceptible to imipenem (mic less than 0.0015 mg/l); the mode mic for fce 22101 was 0.06 mg/l. methicillin-resistant staph. aureus (mrsa) were often slightly more susceptible to fce 22101 than to imipenem. streptococci were more susceptible to imipenem than to fce 22101; mode mics for group a streptococci were 0.003 and 0.03 mg/l and for enterococci 1 and 4 mg/l, respectively. the anaerobic organisms tested were equally susceptible to both fce 22101 and imipenem. imipenem and fce 22101 showed similar bactericidal activity at a concentration equivalent to 4 x mic. fully susceptible staphylococci were killed  rapidly by both compounds, whereas less susceptible isolates, especially mrsa, were killed slowly. streptococci, other than str. pneumoniae, were also killed relatively slowly. bacteroides fragilis group organisms were rapidly killed by both fce 22101 and imipenem.

AB  == the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative  bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins  characterized by longer half lives.

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  == the recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. these include  respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. the important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) include staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella sp. the anaerobic blpb are all bacteroidiaceae and include bacteroides fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus group, b. oralis, b. oris-buccae, and fusobacterium sp. laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity  of these organisms and the distribution of these blpb in various infections are reviewed. blpb may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic blpb require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

AB  == it has been postulated that the widespread use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins might lead to increased bacterial resistance to such agents. to determine if such increased resistance to cefoperazone might be detectable, the susceptibility patterns of common clinical isolates to cefoperazone were examined from the pathology laboratories at baptist medical center, jacksonville, florida, from 1981, prior to approval by the food and drug administration, to the present. gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms, staphylococci, and members of the bacteroides fragilis group were included in the analysis. the data obtained were compared with results of similar published studies nationwide. no significant decrease in susceptibility to cefoperazone was detected for any gram-negative species examined. a steady increase in the percentage of staphylococci (both coagulase positive and especially coagulase negative) resistant to cefoperazone was demonstrable at this institution. this was a direct function of the concomitant rise in the percentages of staphylococci resistant to methicillin observed over the testing interval. anaerobic susceptibility patterns of the members of the b. fragilis group were also relatively constant during this period of time. the concentrations of antibiotic inhibiting 50 percent (mic50) and 90 percent (mic90) of b. fragilis isolates as determined by an agar dilution  technique were 16 micrograms/ml and 64 micrograms/ml, respectively, both in 1981  and in 1987. no change in the national susceptibility patterns of common bacterial isolates to cefoperazone was demonstrable in the five-year period during which the antibiotic has been available for clinical use.

TI  == use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  == ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due  to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. the current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. the experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. empiric single agent or combination  agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. the most important organisms known to cause these infections are pseudomonas sp. and enterobacteriaceae. management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the bacteroides fragilis group and enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora.  the management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.

TI  == synergy between spiramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
AB  == the in-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in the eradication of infection caused by bacteroides spp. alone and in combination with neisseria gonorrhoea, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes or str. faecalis. the in-vitro tests consisted of determinations of the mics with or without the addition of a constant amount of the other antimicrobials. the mics of metronidazole for b. melaninogenicus, b. fragilis and b. bivius were significantly reduced by the addition of 0.125 mg/l spiramycin. the in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspension. combined  therapy of mixed infections showed further significant reduction of the numbers of bacteroides spp. in seven of 12 combinations and of the aerobic and facultative bacteria in four of 12 combinations. furthermore, a reduction in the  number of facultative anaerobes was noted in mixed infections with bacteroides spp. which were treated with metronidazole alone. the synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have important clinical implications in the treatment of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infections.

AB  == dup 105 and 721, synthetic antibiotics belonging to a totally novel chemical class (oxazolidinones), have been found to be active in vitro against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. dup 721 had geometric mean mics ranging from 1.1 to 16 mg/l against 167 strains of staph. aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. saprophyticus, streptococci  of groups a, b and d and diphtheroids. dup 105 was between 1.5 and eight-fold less active. bacteroides fragilis strains were also susceptible to the dup compounds (mean mics being 8.3 and 14.9 mg/l for dup 721 and 105, respectively),  but other gram-negative species and yeasts were not inhibited by concentrations in excess of 100 mg/l. both compounds had a predominantly bacteriostatic action.  no primary resistance was found, and the incidence of resistant variants in 105 strains tested was less than 1 per 10(8) bacteria.

AB  == to compare the effectiveness of cefotetan administered at 2 g once a day with cefoxitin at 1 or 2 g three times a day in the treatment of hospitalized patients with skin and superficial soft tissue infections, 194 patients from eight centers were enrolled in an open, randomized trial. most of the 104 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 50 in the cefoxitin group were young men with community-acquired, moderate or severe cellulitis, or abscesses of the upper and  lower extremities caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, bacteroides fragilis and other species of bacteroides, peptococcus species, and peptostreptococcus species. the mean duration of treatment was 7.5 days for cefotetan and 7.1 days for cefoxitin. a successful clinical response was achieved in 97 percent of the cefotetan patients and in 94 percent of the cefoxitin patients. of the 88 and 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the cefotetan and cefoxitin groups, respectively, a satisfactory bacteriologic response occurred in 96 percent and 87 percent of the  patients. no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory determinations were noted. the incidence of adverse reactions in the cefotetan group (17 percent) was significantly different from that for the cefoxitin group (6 percent) (p less than 0.05); however, the incidence of treatment-related reactions was not significant and the events were mild. discontinuation of therapy was necessary only in two patients in whom allergic-type reactions developed. a once-daily regimen of cefotetan was as effective as thrice-daily cefoxitin in this study in the treatment of primarily polymicrobial, moderate, or severe infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.

TI  == ciprofloxacin: in vitro, experimental, and clinical evaluation.
AB  == ciprofloxacin at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml inhibited the growth of approximately 90% of 584 strains of aerobic bacteria isolated from cultures of blood drawn from septicemic patients. an increase in the inoculum size did not result in an increased mic, but serial passages through media containing ciprofloxacin at sub-mic levels increased the mic for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus vulgaris. in experimental subcutaneous abscesses in the mouse model, ciprofloxacin was more active than cefotaxime against a mixed infection induced with e. coli and bacteroides fragilis. against  mixed e. coli and staphylococcus aureus infection, no significant differences were noted between the two drugs. in a double-blind, prospective, randomized clinical study, perorally administered ciprofloxacin was compared with intravenously administered cefotaxime in the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections severe enough to require hospitalization. in 70 patients treated, the  therapeutic efficacy of peroral ciprofloxacin was comparable to that of intravenous cefotaxime, with two differences: s. aureus infections responded less favorably to oral ciprofloxacin (62%) than to intravenous cefotaxime (90%), and aerobic gram-negative bacillary infections responded more favorably to ciprofloxacin (92%) than to cefotaxime (64%).

TI  == [in vitro synergy between cefotaxime and its main metabolite, desacetylcefotaxime].
AB  == in vitro synergistic interaction between cefotaxime (ctx) and its main metabolite, desacetyl-cefotaxime (dctx), against 7 species of clinical isolates (23-27 strains per species) was examined. complete or partial synergy was noted with a 1:1 combination of ctx and dctx against 22-78% of the bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas cepacia and enterobacter cloacae isolates examined. antagonistic effects of the drugs appeared against 11% of proteus vulgaris and 4% of serratia marcescens. when combined at various ratios by the checkerboard method and tested against b. fragilis, ctx and dctx were found to act synergistically, and no antagonism occurred. the combined use of ctx and dctx exhibited strong bactericidal activity against b. fragilis and inhibited bacterial regrowth. an experiment with concentrations of ctx and dctx simulating human serum levels after intravenous administration also showed that the coexistence of dctx augmented bactericidal activity of ctx against b. fragilis and brought inhibitory effects on bacterial regrowth. it is presumed from the present results that clinically applied ctx would have more potent effects than expected from in vitro sensitivity test data.

TI  == beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in head and neck infection.
AB  == we have summarized our experience in recovery of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) in head and neck infection (hni). these hni include conjunctivitis, serous and chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, chronic mastoiditis, chronic sinusitis, adenoiditis, recurrent tonsillitis in children and adults, peritonsillar abscess, and retropharyngeal abscess. beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were found in 262 (51%) of 513 patients with hni; 72% had aerobic blpb and 57% had anaerobic blpb. the infections, where these organisms were most frequently recovered, were adenoiditis (85% of patients), tonsillitis in adults (82%) and children (74%), retropharyngeal abscess (71%), and chronic otitis media (57%). the predominant blpb were staphylococcus aureus (49% of patients with blpb), the bacteroides-melaninogenicus group (28%), the bacteroides fragilis group (20%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), hemophilus influenzae (5%), and branhamella catarrhalis (3%). the high incidence of recovery of blpb in head and neck infections may have important implications on the antimicrobial management of these infections.

TI  == the role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in respiratory tract infections.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides sp. (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides fragilis), peptostreptococci and fusobacterium sp. are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (rti). these organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative  and anaerobic bacteria. a recent increase in numbers of bet-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in rti has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. these  infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis and lung abscesses. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

AB  == the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (cp-62,993; 9-deoxo-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin a; also designated xz-450 [pliva pharmaceuticals, zagreb, yugoslavia]) showed a significant improvement in potency against gram-negative organisms compared with erythromycin while retaining the classic erythromycin spectrum. it was up to four times more potent than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae and twofold more potent against branhamella catarrhalis, campylobacter species, and legionella species. it had activity similar to that of erythromycin against chlamydia spp. azithromycin was significantly more potent versus many genera of the family enterobacteriaceae; its mic for 90% of strains of escherichia, salmonella, shigella, and yersinia was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 16 to 128 micrograms/ml for erythromycin. azithromycin inhibited the majority of gram-positive organisms at less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. it displayed cross-resistance to erythromycin-resistant staphylococcus and streptococcus isolates. it had moderate activity against bacteroides fragilis and was comparable to erythromycin against other anaerobic species. azithromycin also demonstrated improved bactericidal activity in comparison with erythromycin. the  mechanism of action of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin since azithromycin competed effectively for [14c]erythromycin ribosomebinding sites.

TI  == microbiological studies of tracheostomy site wounds.
AB  == specimens were obtained from 25 patients who developed tracheostomy site wound infections. aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 4 (16%) instances, anaerobic bacteria only in 2 (8%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered  in 19 (76%). a total of 145 isolates (72 aerobes and 73 anaerobes) were recovered, an average of 5.8 isolates per specimen (2.9 aerobes and 2.9 anaerobes). the most frequently recovered isolates were peptostreptococcus sp., bacteroides sp., alpha-hemolytic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. twenty-nine isolates recovered from 19 (72%) patients produced beta-lactamase. these included all isolates of staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis group and 4 of 11 (36%) of bacteroides melaninogenicus group. the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of tracheostomy site wound infection, and the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in most of these infections, may have important implications for their management.

TI  == metronidazole and spiramycin in abscesses caused by bacteroides spp. and staphylococcus aureus in mice.
AB  == the activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in vitro and also in vivo, in the eradication of infection caused by bacteroides spp. and staphylococcus aureus, alone or in combination. the mics of  metronidazole for the b. melaninogenicus and b. fragilis strains were significantly reduced by the addition of spiramycin (from 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, to 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l, respectively). antimicrobial synergy between metronidazole  and spiramycin was noted against bacteroides spp. in abscesses caused in mice by  subcutaneous injection of bacteroides spp. alone or in combination with s. aureus. furthermore, an additional reduction in the number of s. aureus was noted in mixed infections with bacteroides that were treated with metronidazole alone.  the antimicrobial synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have clinical implications that deserve to be further investigated.

AB  == the comparative in-vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031), a new semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, was assessed against approximately 400 bacterial isolates.  the new drug demonstrated excellent activity against penicillin-susceptible streptococci (mic90s less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90 = 0.25 mg/l). among other gram-positive organisms tested, a  significant number were resistant to a-56268 as well as to erythromycin and clindamycin. a-56268 was at least as active as erythromycin against pasteurella multocida and campylobacter jejuni, but was more active than erythromycin against legionella spp. (mic90 less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l), bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l) and bact. melaninogenicus (mic90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l). activity of a-56268 was ph dependent (more active at ph 7 than at ph 6) and was moderately affected by inoculum size. the drug was bactericidal against two strains of streptococcus pyogenes tested, but exerted a bacteriostatic effect against staphylococcus aureus and str. faecalis.

TI  == synergism between bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus in experimental  tibial osteomyelitis.
AB  == we explored the potential role of microbial synergy in an experimental rat osteomyelitis model. osteomyelitis was assessed by gross pathologic conditions and quantitative cultivation of rat tibiae for the implanted organisms 21 days after challenge. when staphylococcus aureus was used alone, the 50% infective dose (id50) and the 100% infective dose (id100) were 400 and 25,000 colony-forming units (cfu), respectively. when bacteroides fragilis was inoculated alone, the id50 was 150,000 organisms, and the id100 was not confidently determined. subinfectious numbers of b. fragilis added to the staphylococcal inocula yielded an id100 as low as 20 staphylococci. mixed inocula with 20 or 200 staphylococci and increasing numbers of b. fragilis yielded a dose-dependent increase in the number of staphylococci isolated from osteomyelitic tibiae. multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the two inocula and their interaction to be significantly predictive of the 21-day quantitative assessment of staphylococci (r = 0.80). synergy was most striking at low bacterial inocula. when even large numbers of s. aureus were added to b. fragilis, the b. fragilis inoculum required to initiate b. fragilis osteomyelitis was essentially unchanged. we conclude that small numbers of b. fragilis allow remarkably low numbers of s. aureus (20 or 200 cfu) to establish osteomyelitis in the rat.

TI  == ceforanide. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == ceforanide is a 'second generation' cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly. it is similar to cefamandole and cefonicid in its in vitro superiority to 'first generation' cephalosporins against several species of enterobacteriaceae as well as its activity against haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. its activity against staphylococcus aureus is less than that of cefamandole, cefuroxime and first generation cephalosporins. the in vitro activity against neisseria gonorrhoeae is excellent. pseudomonas, acinetobacter and serratia species, and bacteroides fragilis are resistant, as are many strains of proteus and providencia species. the elimination half-life is relatively long, although shorter than that of cefonicid, and in most clinical trials ceforanide has been administered twice daily. it appeared to be comparable in therapeutic efficacy to procaine penicillin and cephazolin in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, to cephazolin in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections due  to s. aureus or beta-haemolytic streptococci and to cefapirin in s. aureus endocarditis in parenteral drug abusers. also, it was comparable in efficacy to cephalothin in the prophylaxis of infection in patients undergoing open heart surgery or vaginal hysterectomy, and to cephazolin in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. thus, ceforanide is an alternative to first and certain other second generation cephalosporins in several important therapeutic and prophylactic situations. it has no advantage over other cephalosporins with regard to spectrum of antibacterial activity, but has a longer half-life than other second generation cephalosporins, except cefonicid, and can be administered according to a twice daily dosage schedule.

TI  == the role of bacteroides encapsulation in the lethal synergy between escherichia coli and bacteroides species studied in a rat fibrin clot peritonitis model.
AB  == encapsulation in bacteroides species has been thoroughly studied in vivo as a virulence factor in abscess formation. its pathogenic role in lethal infections caused by a mixture of pathogens has been less well investigated. our previous studies using the rat fibrin clot peritonitis model have demonstrated lethal synergy between bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli. in order to determine  the synergistic role of the encapsulation of the bacteroides component in this model, inoculations of e. coli plus one of seven bacteroides strains of differing degrees of encapsulation were assessed for their effect on mortality. both unencapsulated bacteroides strains tested (b. distasonis 1244, b. vulgatus 4300)  produced an early lethal synergistic effect with e. coli while the heavily encapsulated strain, b. thetaiotaomicron 1603 did not do so. the four other bacteroides strains tested were encapsulated and their synergy with e. coli was demonstrated. control gram-positive strains, streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, did not alter mortality when mixed with e. coli in this model. these studies support the concept that virulence factors other than encapsulation are important in the outcome of polymicrobial infections in which bacteroides species play a part.

TI  == effect of bacteroides fragilis cellular components on chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes towards escherichia coli.
AB  == chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) in response to cell components  of bacteroides fragilis alone or in combination with escherichia coli was evaluated. e. coli produced much more powerful chemotactic factors than b. fragilis. the culture filtrate (cf), outer membrane (om) preparation, and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of b. fragilis slightly stimulated chemotactic activity  of pmnl. the culture filtrate and om preparation were capable of inhibiting the chemotaxis of pmnl in response to the chemotactic factors of e. coli but lps of b. fragilis was not able to do so. reduction by b. fragilis of pmnl chemotaxis in response to e. coli was not specific for b. fragilis but also occurred in the presence of facultative bacteria. in parallel with chemotaxis, lysozyme release,  but not beta-glucuronidase release, by pmnl was significantly stimulated by e. coli but not by b. fragilis.

AB  == different strains of bacteroides fragilis exhibit great differences in sensitivity towards serum from healthy volunteers. in the presence of 10% autologous serum, neutrophilic granulocytes and monocytes (macrophages) caused significant killing of b. fragilis. the measured phagocytic and killing activity  of the cells is comparable to their activity against aerobic bacteria (s. aureus). in four patients with chronic granulomatous disease of childhood, phagocytosis was normal but killing of b. fragilis and s. aureus in granulocytes  or monocytes (macrophages) was appreciably lowered. this malfunction of the cells was accompanied by a disturbance in oxidative metabolism and inadequate iodination after phagocytosis of b. fragilis. the results suggest that granulocytes and monocytes play an important role in host defense against endogenous infections with anaerobes.

TI  == microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  == patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. these infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. with treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent;  however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. among the aerobic gram-positive organisms,  several varieties of streptococci such as group b streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen.  among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is escherichia coli. klebsiella sp. and proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are peptostreptococci and peptococci. clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens. bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. other organisms encountered are chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.

TI  == the relevance of microbiology in the management of anorectal sepsis.
AB  == eighty patients with anorectal sepsis were studied over three years. all abscesses were drained and pus was submitted for culture. if a fistula was found  when the abscess was drained it was laid open otherwise a second examination under anaesthetic was performed within 7-10 days. in no case was sterile pus obtained. gut aerobes, predominantly escherichia coli, were isolated from 49 of 53 (92.5%) of patients with a fistula and 8 of 27 (29.6%) of those without. 'gut-specific bacteroides' predominantly bacteroides fragilis were isolated from  47 of 53 (88.7%) patients with a fistula and 5 of 27 (18.5%) of those without. anaerobes not specific to the gut, predominantly b. asaccharolyticus, b. ureolyticus, peptococci and peptostreptococci, in the absence of those specific to the gut, were isolated from 2 of 53 patients with a fistula (3.8%) and 17 of 27 (63%) of those without. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from only 1 of 53 (1.9%) patients with a fistula but from 8 of 27 (29.6%) of those without. it is concluded that only patients with gut-specific organisms should be submitted to a second examination under anaesthetic and that culture of pus in anorectal sepsis  is an essential part of its management.

TI  == anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB  == twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. the etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. the predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), bacteroides sp. (21), fusobacterium sp. (8), streptococcus sp. (5) and clostridium sp. (4). the organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. these included all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis (4) and of staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 bacteroides oralis. the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.

TI  == cefonicid. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacological properties and therapeutic use.
AB  == cefonicid is a 'second generation' cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly. it is similar to cefamandole in its superiority to first generation cephalosporins against several enterobacteriaceae as well as its activity against haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. its activity against staphylococcus aureus is similar to that of cefoxitin and inferior to cefamandole and first generation cephalosporins. it has excellent in vitro activity against neisseria gonorrhoeae, but is inactive against pseudomonas, acinetobacter, serratia, and bacteroides fragilis. due to high achievable plasma concentrations and a relatively long half-life, in most clinical trials cefonicid has been administered once daily. it was comparable in  efficacy with cefamandole or cefazolin in the treatment of patients with urinary  tract, lower respiratory tract, and soft tissue and bone infections. it has also  been compared with penicillin in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea. results from a small series of patients with endocarditis appear to indicate that cefonicid should not be used in patients with serious staphylococcal infections.  single doses of cefonicid given preoperatively appear to offer a similar degree of protection against post-surgical infection as multiple doses of other antibiotics, but further data from studies involving larger numbers of patients are needed to confirm these impressions. patients who require prolonged antibiotic therapy, such as those with osteomyelitis being treated as outpatients after a relatively short inpatient course, could benefit from the once daily dose regimen of cefonicid.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 23-6240, a new difluoroquinolone derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == ro 23-6240 is a new difluorinated quinolone antimicrobial agent. its in vitro activity against a wide range of bacteria was compared with those of other quinolones and beta-lactams. generally, members of the family enterobacteriaceae  were inhibited by low concentrations of ro 23-6240 (mic90 [mic for 90% of isolates tested], less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml). ninety percent of staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) and neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) showed intermediate susceptibility, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) was less susceptible. strains resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all the quinolones tested. the protein binding of ro 23-6240  (5 micrograms/ml) was 27%.

TI  == [bacteriologic findings and therapeutic consequences in adnexitis].
AB  == after laparoscopic confirmation of adnexitis, a bacteriological examination was made of specimens taken from the small pelvis of 63 patients, with an average age of 26.4 years, at the rheinischen landesfrauenklinik (gynecological hospital) in  wuppertal. to this end, various aerobic and anaerobic optimal and selective culture media were used. the cultured germs were identified with api systems, other conventional methods, and by using gas chromatography. all bacilli were tested for their sensitivity to mezlocillin and metronidazole. in 40 cases (63.5%), it was possible to determine 1-10 bacilli from the inner genital tract.  in most cases there was an aerobic/anaerobic mixed infection, with participation  of streptococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, as well as peptococci, peptostreptococci and bacteroid types. neisseria gonorrhoeae was only identified  three times. in 23 cases (36.5%), it was not possible to determine bacilli in spite of definite inflammatory symptoms. since, according to international literature, chlamydia trachomatis was to be found on the inflamed tubes of roughly one third of cases of adnexitis, the presence of this bacillus is suspected even in the many bacteriologically negative cases in the author's own study. only in one case of a monoinfection by staphylococcus aureus did the combination of mezlocillin and metronidazole prove to be unsuitable. in 25% of the cases where the presence of bacilli was proved, metronidazole was even necessary, since bacilli of the bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides bivius and disiens groups were involved, all of which are capable of inactivating penicillins and cephalosporins by formation of a beta-lactamase.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and beta-lactamase activity in abscesses.
AB  == the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) in abscesses was investigated in 109 abscesses. single isolates were recovered in 23 (21%) instances and were predominantly staphylococcus aureus. the other abscesses yielded growth of two or more aerobic and/or anaerobic organisms. aerobic bacteria were recovered in 28 (26%) of the aspirates, anaerobic bacteria in 41 (38%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 40 (36%). a total of 362 isolates (247 anaerobes and 115 aerobes) were recovered, accounting for 3.3 isolates per specimen (2.2 anaerobes and 1.1 aerobes). one hundred beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered in 88 (77%) specimens. these included all 28 isolates of bacteroides fragilis, 18 of 30 bacteroides melaninogenicus, 42 of 43 s. aureus, and 11 of 14 escherichia coli. beta-lactamase activity was detected in 40 (55%) of the purulent specimens when using the chromogenic cephalosporin nitrocefin method. these data demonstrate the presence of aerobic and anaerobic blpb in abscesses.

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.

AB  == a prospective randomized trial was performed to compare oral neomycin and erythromycin with single-dose intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone in elective colorectal surgery. the study was discontinued after 60 patients were entered. the overall rate of infection was 41 percent in the oral neomycin and erythromycin group (n = 29) compared with 9.6 percent in those who received intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone (n = 31) (p less than 0.01). infections in the oral group were principally due to resistant staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli. preoperative administration of oral neomycin and erythromycin was associated with a significant reduction of escherichia coli counts (1 x 10(7) to 3 x 10(5) organisms/ml, p less than 0.05) compared with the intravenous group, but there was no significant reduction in the counts of bacteroides fragilis (2 x 10(8) to 1 x 10(7) organisms/ml) and there was an increase in the counts of clostridia (2 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6) organisms/ml). these results indicate that single-dose systemic prophylaxis with  appropriate antibiotics is superior to oral neomycin and erythromycin.

TI  == variation in the potentiation of beta-lactam antibiotic activity by clavulanic acid and sulbactam against multiply antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == using a broth microdilution method, we studied 120 strains of beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates to determine the potentiating effect of clavulanic acid and sulbactam (both beta-lactamase inhibitors) on the antibacterial activity of a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics. all antibiotics were tested alone and in combination with each inhibitor simultaneously using low (10(5) cfu/ml) and high (10(7) cfu/ml) inocula. against the strains of escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae the addition of both inhibitors significantly potentiated the activity of most antibiotics at the low inoculum. at the high inoculum, however, this effect was abrogated against e. coli and most strains of h. influenzae. antibiotic activity was significantly enhanced by the inhibitors at both inoculum sizes with bacteroides fragilis. antibiotic resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa was little affected by the inhibitors. among methicillin-resistant staphylococci, antibiotic potentiation by the inhibitors was more significant for staphylococcus aureus than the coagulase-negative staphylococci.

TI  == the comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). pefloxacin (mics mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against enterobacteriaceae. gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. pefloxacin (mics 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (mics 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (mics 0.001-0.008 mg/l). pefloxacin (mics 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (mics 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (mics 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and  norfloxacin (mics 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.002-0.008 mg/l). the activity of pefloxacin (mics 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (mics 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (mics 0.5-4 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin (mics 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. pefloxacin (mics mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic  strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (mics 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.

TI  == neutrophil activity in abscess-bearing mice: comparative studies with neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood, elicited peritoneal exudates, and abscesses.
AB  == intraabdominal abscesses were induced in mice by intraperitoneal inoculation of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli plus bran as the abscess-potentiating agent. six- or seven-day-old abscesses were mechanically disaggregated in buffer, and the cells obtained were fractionated on discontinuous percoll density gradients. neutrophil populations of different density, each approximately 90% pure, were isolated. when the abscess-derived neutrophils were subsequently incubated with normal serum in vitro under aerobic conditions, the viability of the gram-negative bacteria that had been phagocytosed within the abscess did not  change significantly. this anergy to intracellular bacteria (on subsequent incubation in vitro under optimal conditions for phagocytic killing) was also found for neutrophils that had been obtained from abscesses induced by a mixture  that included proteus mirabilis plus b. fragilis and from those induced by e. coli plus p. mirabilis. while unable to significantly kill intracellular organisms that had been phagocytosed in vivo, the abscess-derived neutrophils could engulf and kill organisms to which they were exposed in vitro. neutrophils  from abscesses induced by p. mirabilis only plus bran killed that organism introduced in vitro significantly more effectively than the organisms that had been engulfed in vivo. in contrast, neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism staphylococcus aureus plus bran were able to kill their intracellular organisms on subsequent incubation in vitro as effectively as they  could kill added s. aureus. neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood and from induced peritoneal exudates of abscess-bearing mice were able to phagocytose and kill organisms in vitro with greater efficiency than abscess-derived neutrophils. the mechanism whereby neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism s. aureus can kill the organisms phagocytosed in vivo on subsequent in vitro incubation, in contrast to the relative anergy to their intracellular organisms displayed by neutrophils derived from abscesses induced by combinations of gram-negative bacteria, is not known.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. the activity of ofloxacin was two  to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was more active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., legionella spp., and bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin,  enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with s. aureus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa. ofloxacin strongly inhibited dna supercoiling activity of dna gyrase purified from e. coli kl-16. there is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and  its inhibitory action against dna gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of e. coli. these results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against dna gyrase in bacterial cells.

TI  == protease production by microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  == factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. microorganisms including bacteroides bivius, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.

AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

TI  == the cefoperazone-sulbactam combination. in vitro qualities including beta-lactamase stability, antimicrobial activity, and interpretive criteria for disk diffusion tests.
AB  == three concentrations of the penicillanic acid sulfone, sulbactam were tested in combination with cefoperazone against 632 recent clinical bacterial isolates. cefoperazone was effective alone (less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) against 95% of enterobacteriaceae and combined with 4 micrograms/ml sulbactam inhibited 99.5% of strains. this coverage of enteric bacilli was superior to timentin (99.1%), ceftazidime (98.2%), and tobramycin (90.9%). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefoperazone-susceptible strains also were markedly decreased by sulbactam (overall mic90s, 8.0 micrograms/ml for cefoperazone and 1.0 microgram/ml for cefoperazone and 4.0 micrograms/ml for sulbactam). sulbactam also expanded the spectrum of cefoperazone against acinetobacter species, some rare pseudomonas species, and bacteroides fragilis group species. sulbactam had direct antimicrobial activity against the acinetobacters and pseudomonas acidovorans, but the increased activity of cefoperazone-sulbactam against some other pseudomonas species and anaerobes was attributed to beta-lactamase inhibition. the cefoperazone mics against beta-lactamase producing staphylococcus species also were lowered to the level of enzyme-deficient strains. cefoperazone  bactericidal activity was improved by 4.0 micrograms/ml sulbactam, and no antagonism was observed. beta-lactamase hydrolysis studies confirmed a slow hydrolysis of cefoperazone only by tem beta-lactamases and a high-grade resistance to enzyme breakdown by sulbactam. differential beta-lactamase affinity studies for cefoperazone and sulbactam showed potential efficacy and applications to plasmid-mediated tem and oxa enzymes and only marginal effective sulbactam inhibition of pseudomonas and klebsiella species enzymes. disk diffusion studies  on 556 strains confirmed the applicability of the cefoperazone 75-micrograms disk to testing routine isolates other than enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the addition of 4.0 micrograms sulbactam/ml in a fixed concentration to dilution test systems and 15 micrograms sulbactam to the 75 micrograms cefoperazone disk were recommended for in vitro tests. susceptibility  and resistant interpretive criteria for the disk and dilution tests can be applied with confidence. only 0.4% false-susceptibility errors and a 97.5% absolute interpretive agreement were achieved using the 75 micrograms cefoperazone/15 micrograms sulbactam disk.

TI  == multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  == bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 s ribosomal rna confers resistance to m, l, and s b-type (mlsb) antibiotics. investigation, by dna annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from streptococcus (groups a,b,d, and h, and pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus licheniformis, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the mlsb resistance (r) determinants. a minimum of four distinct classes of mlsb r determinants could be defined: classes a and b for the gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class c for b. licheniformis, and class d for bact. fragilis. these data do not support the hypothesis that the r determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the gram-positive cocci. the genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards mlsb antibiotics. inactivation of the drug confers resistance  to m and/or l and/or s or sa or sb antibiotics and has been detected in strains of streptococcus, staph. aureus, lactobacillus, c. perfringens, streptomyces, and recently in the gram-negative organism escherichia coli. we have cloned and sequenced a dna fragment conferring high level resistance (mic greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. the distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. the gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of e. coli belonging to various biotypes, in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic  in enterobacteria.

TI  == evolution and epidemiology of mls resistance.
AB  == within the framework of this symposium, it is not feasible to present an exhaustive description of the present state of knowledge regarding the sensitivity and resistance of bacterial species to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (mls). this paper is limited to a description of the evolution of  different types of resistance in the light of decisive factors described in previous papers, in order to deduce, if at all possible, trends in future strategy in therapeutics. only acquired resistance lends itself to epidemiological study, in contrast to natural resistance which is, by definition, characteristic of a species or a genus, and not liable to change. three groups will therefore be studied in turn: staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and bacteroides fragilis. there is as yet insufficient accumulated data to draw conclusions regarding the epidemiology and evolution of mlsb resistance observed  in clostridium perfringens and corynebacterium diphtheriae, or regarding the high-level resistance to erythromycin due to enzymatic inactivation recently described in escherichia coli.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  == 189 bacterial strains were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ceftazidime (alone and in combination with another antibiotic). moreover, the possibility to prevent development of secondary bacterial resistance as observed  in subcultures at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations, was studied using specific antibiotic combinations. of 115 staphylococcal strains (91 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 24 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis), 2% were sensitive, 82% were moderately sensitive and 16% were resistant to ceftazidime. on combining ceftazidime with vancomycin, synergism was found in 61% of the strains, and secondary resistance to ceftazidime could be prevented with this combination. the combination of ceftazidime and clindamycin showed synergism in 26% and an additive effect in 48% of the strains. secondary resistance to ceftazidime did not develop with this combination in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations in which loss of activity was only minimal with clindamycin alone. rifampicin and fusidic acid were highly active against staphylococci. in combination with ceftazidime, only weak synergism or additive effects were seen in most strains; no antagonism could be observed. in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations, secondary resistance to rifampicin and fusidic acid developed rapidly and could be partially prevented by adding ceftazidime. of 60 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 84% were sensitive, 13% were moderately sensitive and 2% were resistant to ceftazidime. synergism was most frequently observed when ceftazidime was combined with tobramycin. using this combination, secondary resistance of pseudomonas strains to ceftazidime did not develop. when ceftazidime was combined with piperacillin, synergism was observed in most strains, but the development of secondary resistance in vitro was not prevented.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  == adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk0787/mk0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. major pathogens isolated included staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus species. satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. no major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. the results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == effect of bacterial competition on the opsonization, phagocytosis, and intracellular killing of microorganisms by granulocytes.
AB  == the ingestion of escherichia coli by human granulocytes in vitro was reduced in the presence of bacteroides fragilis or staphylococcus aureus. this reduction of  ingestion proved to be mainly attributable to the absence of opsonization of e. coli, which was due to complement consumption by b. fragilis and s. aureus. the intracellular killing of e. coli was decreased in the presence of b. fragilis and s. aureus because of consumption of complement components required for extracellular stimulation of granulocytes to kill intracellular bacteria. decreased intracellular killing of e. coli by granulocytes containing either b. fragilis or s. aureus is due to the limited killing capacity of granulocytes. these interactions between e. coli and b. fragilis or s. aureus found for phagocytosis and intracellular killing were also observed in in vivo studies: in  an experimental thigh lesion infection in mice, e. coli showed stronger proliferation after coinoculation with b. fragilis or with s. aureus than after injection of e. coli alone. these in vitro and in vivo findings indicate that bacterial interactions, not only between aerobic and anaerobic bacteria but also  between two species of aerobic microorganisms, compete for host defense mechanisms (i.e., opsonization, phagocytosis, and intracellular killing).

TI  == role of imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of soft tissue infections.
AB  == imipenem/cilastatin was given to 243 evaluable patients with moderately severe to severe soft tissue infections. cultures prior to therapy yielded staphylococcus aureus (108 isolates), group d and non-group d enterococci (49), group a streptococci (42), other aerobic gram-positive cocci (72), pseudomonas aeruginosa (54), escherichia coli (32), proteus mirabilis (31), enterobacter (21), klebsiella (20), other aerobic gram-negative rods (58), bacteroides fragilis group (16), and other anaerobes (65). overall, 95 percent (230 of 243) of the patients treated had clinical cure (137 of 243) or improvement (93 of 243). of the 506 strains of etiologic bacterial pathogens isolated from these patients and tested against imipenem, 498 (98 percent) were susceptible to the antibiotic. many were resistant to both older and newer penicillins and cephalosporins. serial cultures of infection sites revealed that 426 of 498 (86 percent) of pre-therapy bacterial isolates were eradicated by imipenem/cilastatin therapy. eight of 498 etiologic pathogens (1.6 percent) acquired resistance to imipenem (seven p. aeruginosa and one enterococcus). such resistance acquisition was associated with clinical failure in two patients. imipenem/cilastatin appears to  be a highly effective, relatively safe therapy of soft tissue infections caused by a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, both  polymicrobial and monomicrobial in nature. imipenem/cilastatin should be considered particularly when infection by the more antibiotic-resistant of these  bacteria is suspected or proved.

AB  == the availability of a rapid and highly specific polarographic method of analysis  for formaldehyde enabled investigation of the rate of formaldehyde release from noxythiolin solutions and actual concentrations of formaldehyde in solutions during clinical use and storage. the antimicrobial activity of noxythiolin solutions, equivalent pure formaldehyde solutions and n-methylthiourea individually or in combination was examined against standard bacteriological strains and clinical isolates. several interesting observations were made. clinical isolates were found to be relatively susceptible to noxythiolin in contrast to laboratory strains. the growth phase of the organism radically affects activity, early exponential phase cells being susceptible to 1.0% noxythiolin. levels of formaldehyde detected in fresh noxythiolin solutions are extremely low and would not appear to be solely responsible for the antimicrobial activity observed.

(mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability and inhibitory properties of a new penem antibiotic, sch 34343.
AB  == sch 34343 is a new penem antibiotic. its in-vitro activity was determined against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. sch 34343 inhibited 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp, citrobacter spp. and shigella spp. at less than 1 mg/1. ninety per cent of strains of enterobacter, morganella and providencia spp. were inhibited by less than 4 mg/1. sch 34343 did not inhibit pseudomonas spp., and it had slightly less activity against enterobacteriaceae than did cefotaxime or latamoxef (moxalactam), but it inhibited organisms resistant to cefoxitin, cefoperazone and piperacillin. sch 34343 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/1, and it inhibited haemolytic streptococci at less than or equal to 0.06 mg/1. sch 34343 inhibited bacteroides fragilis at 0.06 mg/1, including some cefoxitin-resistant isolates. sch 34343 was not hydrolysed by plasmid- or chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, was an excellent inhibitor of richmond-sykes type ia beta-lactamases, and also inhibited, although less effectively, the common plasmid beta-lactamases. it induced beta-lactamases, but inhibited enterobacter and citrobacter spp. in which it induced beta-lactamase activity.

AB  == using an agar dilution technique we examined the in-vitro activity of sch 34343 against 485 clinical bacterial isolates. ampicillin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefotetan, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin) and gentamicin were used for comparison. sch 34343 exhibited activity against all species tested, excepting pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas species. unlike many newer beta-lactams, sch 34343 was highly active  against gram-positive species. it was consistently active against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic50 and mic90 being usually closely similar, as were results with two inoculum sizes (104 and 106 cfu). this, together with its activity against strains resistant to many other beta-lactam agents, suggested high stability to beta-lactamases. sch 34343 was the most active compound tested  against bacteroides fragilis. in tests of combined bacteriostatic action with gentamicin no synergy was seen. it had bactericidal action in broth culture, against sensitive strains of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. it showed good stability in aqueous solution and serum at low temperatures at ph values in the physiological range, and was moderately stable at 37 degrees c. binding in human plasma was 72%. we concluded  that sch 34343 is a highly promising agent with a broad spectrum of activity making it potentially suitable as monotherapy for patients with infection of undetermined bacterial aetiology, particularly if bact. fragilis is a possible pathogen.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) was investigated by the plate dilution method. since cmz is stable to any type of bacterial beta-lactamases, it inhibited growth of escherichia coli carrying r plasmids, klebsiella spp., proteus vulgaris, and bacteroides fragilis at the concentration of less than 0.78 to 25.0 micrograms/ml. the distinct characteristic of cmz is its anti-mrsa (methicillin- and cephem-resistant staphylococcus aureus) activity. exclusively in mrsa, a new fraction of penicillin binding proteins (pbp) with a relative molecular mass of 78 kd apears, and the 78 kd/pbp possesses low binding affinity  to beta-lactam antibiotics. by the competitive binding experiment of beta-lactam  drugs to the pbps of mrsa, it was revealed that cmz and cephaloridine retain binding affinities to the new 78kd/pbp fraction of mrsa.

TI  == effect of hemothorax on experimental empyema thoracis in the guinea pig.
AB  == an experimental model for empyema thoracis in the duncan-harley guinea pig is introduced. empyema thoracis development and early death (less than 14 days after bacterial inoculation) were noted after various concentrations and species were inoculated into the pleural space with a piece of umbilical tape, which was used  as a cofactor. the effect of concomitant hemothorax was also tested. group i (n = 90) had intrapleural inoculation of umbilical tape and various concentrations (10(4), 10(6), 10(8) organisms/ml) of various bacterial species, which included staphylococcus aureus (n = 30), escherichia coli (n = 30), and bacteroides fragilis (n = 30). group ii (n = 90) had intrapleural inoculation of umbilical tape, 1 ml of autologous blood, and the same varying concentrations and species of bacteria as group i. the observation period was 14 days, during which time early deaths were noted. fifty-eight percent of the staphylococcal group of animals, 37% of the e. coli group of animals, and none of the b. fragilis group of animals developed empyema. animals with empyema developed significant weight loss (p less than 0.05) and roentgenographic evidence of empyema, which was supported by postmortem pleural reaction and pneumonia scores (p less than 0.05). higher concentrations of inoculated bacteria produced a higher incidence of empyema in the s. aureus and e. coli groups (p less than 0.05), but concomitant hemothorax did not increase the already high incidence of empyema and early death in the e. coli group. empyema caused by b. fragilis did not develop, even with cofactors of umbilical tape and blood. anaerobic infections in this model may require the presence of other aerobic or facultative organisms, the presence of necrotic lung, prior malnutrition, or a combination thereof.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

TI  == bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of  a specific wavelength. hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. this investigation assessed the effect of light-activated hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. light-activated hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus m-g intermedius, streptococcus mutans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, and clostridium perfringens, but did not affect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans. photoactivation of hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. combinations of light-activated hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular s. aureus. the ability of hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the  treatment of abscesses.

TI  == cefonicid: a long-acting, second-generation cephalosporin. antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and adverse effects.
AB  == cefonicid is a new second-generation cephalosporin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum of activity and a prolonged serum elimination half-life. it has good in  vitro activity against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, nonenterococcal streptococci, hemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis and many of the commonly isolated enterobacteriaceae. organisms usually resistant to cefonicid include species of pseudomonas, serratia, acinetobacter and providencia, and bacteroides fragilis. the drug is 98% protein bound in human serum, which probably contributes to its significant reduction of antimicrobial activity measured in serum. limited clinical trials have demonstrated it to be effective for surgical prophylaxis and for treating infections of the urinary tract, lower respiratory tract and bone. failures have  been reported in treatment of soft tissue infections and endocarditis caused by s. aureus. a potential cost reduction may be achieved by administering a single daily dose of cefonicid for established infections or a single preoperative dose  for effective surgical prophylaxis instead of multiple-dose regimens of other, similar agents.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone: a review.
AB  == ceftriaxone possesses potent activity, both in vitro and in vivo, against a broad range of bacteria. mic50 and mic90 geometric means were calculated using the results of broth and agar dilution assays performed worldwide. the mic90 for ceftriaxone overall was 8 micrograms/ml or less for enterobacteriaceae and 0.024  microgram/ml or less for neisseria and hemophilus species. moderate activity was  noted against pseudomonas and acinetobacter species (mic50 12 to 28 micrograms/ml). ceftriaxone was extremely active against nonenterococcal streptococci (mic90 0.07 microgram/ml or less) and quite active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 5 micrograms/ml or less). ceftriaxone generally was inactive against enterococci and methicillin-resistant  staphylococci. activity against anaerobes was good, except for many strains of bacteroides fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron (mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml). ceftriaxone exhibited excellent stability to beta-lactamases. the effect of medium and inoculum on in vitro testing was minimal. excellent activity was demonstrated in vivo. against enterobacteriaceae, nonenterococcal streptococci, and h. influenzae, the pd50 in mice generally was less than 1 mg/kg. s. aureus strains responded moderately (mean pd50 6.5 mg/kg), whereas against most p. aeruginosa strains, pd50s ranged from 5 to greater than 250 mg/kg. the superior pharmacokinetic profile of ceftriaxone compared with that of other new cephalosporins was demonstrated by use of a prophylactic treatment schedule. the  ability of ceftriaxone to penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid and provide excellent therapeutic coverage was confirmed in experimental meningitis models.

TI  == interaction of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against pathogenic bacteria. assessment with the serum bactericidal test.
AB  == cefotaxime (ctx), a third-generation cephalosporin with high potency against virtually all enterobacteriaceae as well as many other clinically important facultative and anaerobic bacteria, is metabolized in vivo to desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx), which also has intrinsic antibacterial activity, albeit less than the  parent compound. to assess the possible additive or synergistic interaction of ctx and its main metabolite, we used a micromethod to measure serum bactericidal  activity in samples containing ctx with and without des-ctx. forty subject samples with 0.8-55.8 micrograms/ml of ctx and 1.1-11.6 micrograms/ml of des-ctx  and matched simulated serum samples with 0.8-57.2 micrograms/ml were tested against clinical strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis. both sets of sera were reproducibly bactericidal with titers of less than 2-32 against s. aureus, 16-greater than or equal to 2048 against e. coli, and less than 2-64 against b. fragilis. serum bactericidal titers against b. fragilis were higher in 10 of 23 (43%) subject samples in which concentrations of the desacetyl metabolite exceeded 50% of those of ctx when compared with matched simulated samples containing ctx alone in equivalent concentrations. this effect was not observed with samples tested against s. aureus or e. coli. the ultimate clinical importance of any in vitro interaction between ctx and its desacetyl metabolite, however, can likely only be determined  by controlled clinical trials.

TI  == the activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime alone and in combination against anaerobes and staphylococci.
AB  == cefotaxime (ctx) and desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx) alone and in combination were  tested against anaerobic bacteria collected from clinical infections from several geographically diverse medical centers. the ctx minimum inhibitory concentration  (mic) inhibiting 50% of tested bacteroides fragilis strains was in the moderately susceptible range (32 micrograms/ml), but when placed in combination with des-ctx it had a potency compatible to cefoxitin (mic50, 8.0 micrograms/ml). other b. fragilis group species (b. distasonis and b. vulgatus) were also susceptible to ctx and des-ctx alone at the mic50 level. mic90 statistics for ctx, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin were generally in the resistant range. synergy studies showed that 80% of tested anaerobes were synergistically killed by the combination of ctx and des-ctx. most of these strains had their synergy occur at drug levels that could be achieved in vivo. a large number of the b. thetaiotaomicron strains must be considered resistant to the combination because of the very high levels of des-ctx required to produce synergistic killing. other drugs routinely used for anaerobic infections (clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole) also had elevated b. thetaiotaomicron mics. endemic difference in susceptibility to the beta-lactam drugs were observed, especially the ctx-des-ctx combination. the  combination and other beta-lactams were most usable for strains isolated from the portland metropolitan area, were moderately active against those from cleveland,  and were rarely usable on bacteroides isolates at northwestern in chicago. laboratories are urged to monitor the cephalosporin and semisynthetic penicillin  in vitro efficacy and not rely on published statistics. staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to ctx alone, but were even more susceptible (two- to fourfold reduction in mics) when used in combination with des-ctx. these data show ctx to be the most active antistaphylococcal compound among the new cephalosporins and to be comparable to cefamandole and cefuroxime, but superior to the anaerobe-active cefoxitin.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of desacetylcefotaxime compared to other related beta-lactams.
AB  == like all other cephalosporins that contain an acetyl side chain in the 3' position, cefotaxime (ctx) is partially desacetylated in vivo. desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx) possesses a broad antimicrobial spectrum and high beta-lactamase stability. with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, bacteroides fragilis, and staphylococcus aureus, most strains of other species tested usually had mean mics of des-ctx lower than 1 microgram/ml. its activity is generally lower than that of the parent compound. it was only against some strains of p. cepacia that des-ctx surpassed the activity of ctx. the activity of des-ctx markedly exceeds the activity of many therapeutically used cephalosporins. this is especially true for haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, most species of enterobacteriaceae, and streptococci other than streptococcus faecalis.

TI  == significance of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  == organisms of the bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. the relative importance of these bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. this was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. in almost all instances the  aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated bacteroides species. on the other hand, encapsulated b. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group a  streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. encapsulated b. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as escherichia coli and group d streptococci and less important than s. aureus, group a streptococci, and k. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. this study demonstrates that encapsulated bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.

AB  == ceftizoxime is an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin that inhibits a wide  variety of aerobic, anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml as are streptococcal species with the exception of streptococcus faecalis. staphylococcus aureus are inhibited by 3-8 micrograms/ml, while methicillin-resistant. aureus are resistant. bacteroides fragilis are inhibited by 16-64 micrograms/ml. it inhibits pseudomonas aeruginosa at usually achievable  concentrations. ceftizoxime is overall similar in antibacterial activity to cefotaxime and moxalactam. ceftizoxime is not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. serum levels of ceftizoxime after intramuscular and  intravenous injection are similar to those of cefotaxime and moxalactam. the half-life is 1.6 to 1.9 hours in normal individuals. the compound is not metabolized and is cleared from the body by glomerular filtration. ceftizoxime enters most body fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid, to produce therapeutic concentrations against clinically important bacteria. ceftizoxime accumulates in the presence of renal failure, but it is removed from the body by  hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. ceftizoxime has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent when used as treatment for pneumonia, urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, meningitis, peritonitis, gonorrhea,  including penicillinase-producing isolates, and gynecological infections. no major adverse reactions have been associated with the use of ceftizoxime and it has produced neither disulfram -like reactions nor bleeding.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, a quinolone-carboxylic acid derivative, was compared with those of norfloxacin, cefotaxime, cephalexin, ceftazidime, moxalactam, amoxicillin, and methicillin and other agents, as appropriate. the mics of ciprofloxacin for 90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and for pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria spp., and bacteroides fragilis were between 0.005 and 0.8 micrograms/ml, whereas streptococci and staphylococci were all inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin was 4- to 32-fold more active than norfloxacin and inhibited gentamicin-, ameikacin-, cefotaxime-, and moxalactam-resistant members of the family enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the activity of ciprofloxacin was not affected by serum but decreased in the presence of acid  urine. the frequency of resistance to ciprofloxacin was between 10(-7) and 10(-9).

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of clindamycin analogues: pirlimycin, 1,2 a  potent antibacterial agent.
AB  == the preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. the most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, u-57,930e), in which the (2s-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2s-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. this structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and plasmodium berghei. pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and  mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. it readily penetrates b. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses.  a drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. urinary  excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.

AB  == three derivatives of oleandomycin in which the c"-4 hydroxyl moiety was replaced  for the first time with a nitrogen functionality have been compared with erythromycin base and oleandomycin base. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of these derivatives for 90% of a group of clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus were one-half to one-fourth those of erythromycin. the minimum inhibitory  concentrations of the experimental macrolides for 50% of a group of s. aureus isolates resistant to greater than 12.5 micrograms of erythromycin per ml ranged  from 0.2 to 0.39 micrograms/ml. the activities of these experimental compounds were equivalent to the activities of erythromycin against staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides fragilis, and haemophilus influenzae isolates. in general, erythromycin was more active against streptococcus species. each experimental macrolide was superior to erythromycin in inhibiting rna-directed, cell-free polypeptide synthesis. the three experimental compounds were markedly more active than erythromycin base after oral administration to mice infected with s. aureus. the 50% protective doses of the experimental compounds ranged from 27.4 to 45.7 mg/kg; that of erythromycin was approximately 100 mg/kg.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftazidime has been compared with those of cephalothin, cefuroxime, and netilmicin against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in order to register sensitivity patterns in the western part of norway. an agar dilution method was used for minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) determination. ceftazidime was the most active agent against enterobacteriaceae;  all isolates being inhibited by 2 mg/l or less, whereas netilmicin was slightly less active, especially against providencia. cephalothin and cefuroxime were markedly less active than the other two agents against enterobacteriaceae. ceftazidime and netilmicin were active against our pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (mics less than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 8 mg/l, respectively). only netilmicin had useful activity against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. ceftazidime was the least active agent against staphylococcus aureus; nearly all the isolates had mics of 4-8 mg/l. cefuroxime was the most active agent against bacteroides fragilis, whereas ceftazidime was inactive. ceftazidime may, in the future, be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections, particularly when p. aeruginosa might be involved.

TI  == review of cefonicid, a long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and clinical efficacy of cefonicid are reviewed. also discussed are formulary considerations and bacterial resistance. cefonicid, an investigational agent near approval, is less  active than other currently available first- and second-generation cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci, particularly staphylococcus. cefonicid and cefamandole have similar activity that is superior to the first-generation cephalosporins against escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., indole-negative proteus spp., and providencia spp. organisms such as serratia marcescens, acinetobacter, pseudomonas, and bacteroides fragilis are resistant to cefonicid. despite a small volume of distribution and high protein binding, cefonicid achieves high tissue concentrations. approximately 90% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, and the elimination half-life is approximately four hours. cefonicid is usually well tolerated. in treating skin infections, cefonicid was usually less effective than cefazolin against staphylococcus aureus. in genitourinary infections, cefonicid 1 g daily (as the sodium salt) in a single dose has shown comparable efficacy to cefamandole or amoxicillin given in multiple daily doses. based on available data, single daily dosing of cefonicid in the therapy of staph. aureus endocarditis is not effective. in studies of patients undergoing hysterectomy, cesarean section, cholecystectomy, and colorectal surgery, cefonicid 1 g given as a single preoperative dose has produced results comparable with those of cefoxitin 1-2 g (as the sodium salt) given preoperatively and for several doses postoperatively. the major clinical uses of cefonicid will probably be as a possible cost-reducing alternative (based on a single daily dose) to currently available first- and second-generation cephalosporins for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and infections caused by enteric organisms. it may also be useful as a possible cost-reducing alternative to cefoxitin for prophylaxis in hysterectomy and biliary tract surgery.

TI  == [chronological variations in blood isolates and their susceptibility to various antibiotics].
AB  == chronological variation in blood isolates obtained from 1968 to 1982 was studied. escherichia coli was the most frequent isolates followed by klebsiella species, glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods (excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa), enterobacter-serratia group, and staphylococcus aureus. the isolation of glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods, about half of which being achromobacter xylosoxidans, increased greatly in number from 1980. a total of 113 strains of blood isolates was examined for susceptibility to various antibiotics. although there was a significant increase in s. aureus resistant to gm, these strains were susceptible to cephalosporins. in the 9 strains of gm-resistant aerobic gram-negative rods (2 strains of klebsiella, 2 strains of enterobacter, 4 strains of serratia and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa), 3 strains of serratia species were also resistant to amk. two strains of lcm-resistant bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to lmox, but 1 strain was not inhibited by 100 micrograms/ml of  cfx. among the clinical specimens, differences were found in the rate of isolation of resistant strains, particularly in the case of serratia and p. aeruginosa. antibiotic resistant strains were isolated more frequently from urine and the least frequently from sputum. since the frequency of isolation of resistant strains varied according to organism, clinical material and year of isolation, microbiological laboratories should develop their own data base from which clinicians can make rational therapeutic decisions.

TI  == interactions of bacteroides fragilis and phagocytes: studies with whole organisms, purified capsular polysaccharide and clindamycin-treated bacteria.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis plays a key role in the pathogenesis of anaerobic infections and is often found mixed with aerobic organisms. we explored the interactions of  this organism with phagocytes in an attempt to discern additional information about its virulence factors. we confirm an earlier report that killing of aerobic organisms by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) is decreased in the presence of high numbers of bact. fragilis but this effect could also be demonstrated with bact. distasonis or staphylococcus aureus. our data support the concept that this phenomenon may be due to competition for opsonins. virulence of bact. fragilis has been associated with a polysaccharide capsule. we were unable to demonstrate  any deleterious effect of the purified capsular polysaccharide of bact. fragilis  on phagocytosis, killing, or chemotaxis by pmn. we were not able to demonstrate any effect of subinhibitory levels of clindamycin on the interactions of neutrophils and bact. fragilis.

TI  == cefoperazone: a review of its antimicrobial spectrum, beta-lactamase stability, enzyme inhibition, and other in vitro characteristics.
AB  == the in vitro qualities of cefoperazone were reviewed on the basis of international medical literature and some new observations. cefoperazone is highly active against the enterobacteriaceae. its activity against staphylococcus aureus is comparable to that of the other newer cephem antibiotics. cefoperazone  is also active against all beta-hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae and is relatively inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci. against pseudomonas aeruginosa cefoperazone is at least fourfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam and is approximately as active as azlocillin or piperacillin. haemophilus and neisseria species, regardless of beta-lactamase production, are highly susceptible to cefoperazone. against the bacteroides fragilis group, cefoperazone is either very active or quite inactive  because of endemic variations. the drug is slightly less stable to some beta-lactamases than are cefotaxime-like or 7-methoxy cephem drugs. cefoperazone  is a bactericidal beta-lactam, and its minimal inhibitory concentrations are influenced only by high inoculum concentrations of beta-lactamase-producing strains. its ability to permeate bacterial cell membranes appears similar to that of cefotaxime. synergy studies with cefoperazone plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or aminoglycosides against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa show enhanced killing. cefoperazone is 70%-94% protein bound and has high affinities for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins 3, 1a, 2, and 1 bs.

AB  == we studied the activity of azthreonam (sq 26,776), a novel monocyclic beta-lactam compound, against a variety of clinical isolates. it was more potent than moxalactam, cefoperazone, cefamandole, cefoxitin, ticarcillin, tobramycin, or amikacin against strains of klebsiella spp., serratia spp., and the proteus group. it was highly effective against escherichia coli and strains of salmonella spp. the median minimal inhibitory concentration for all species of enterobacteriaceae was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. azthreonam was moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, including tobramycin-resistant  strains, and against pseudomonas cepacia (median minimal inhibitory concentration, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml), but was weakly active against pseudomonas maltophilia and strains of acinetobacter spp. and achromobacter spp. the drug showed little activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and anaerobic  bacteria, including bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., and gram-positive cocci. like moxalactam and cefoperazone, azthreonam exhibited a considerable inoculum effect with strains of enterobacter spp. and pseudomonas spp. combination with clavulanic acid did not increase the activity of azthreonam against s. aureus but was synergistic for 5 of 15 strains of b. fragilis. azthreonam is about 50% bound to human serum protein. the selective range of activity of this compound could be of clinical benefit.

TI  == elective colon surgery: clindamycin versus metronidazole prophylaxis.
AB  == orally administered clindamycin-neomycin as a prophylactic antibiotic in patients scheduled to undergo colon surgery was compared to orally administered metronidazole-neomycin. clindamycin levels of the colon contents and the mucosa were 8 to 10 times higher than the serum levels. three of the 43 patients who received metronidazole had wound infection whereas none of the 38 patients who received clindamycin did. clindamycin may help to prevent staphylococcal infection, a known problem associated with metronidazole use. it may also play a  role in preventing infection at the anastomosis in patients who undergo colon resection.

TI  == 6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.

TI  == distribution of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in infected animals and efficacy  against experimental infections.
AB  == the therapeutic effects produced by formulations of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (brl 25 000a and brl 25 000g) were compared with those of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid separately against a variety of infections produced by amoxicillin-susceptible and beta-lactamase-producing (amoxicillin-resistant) bacteria. the infection models studied included intraperitoneal infections, a mouse pneumonia, experimental pyelonephritis, and local lesions caused by staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis. the distribution of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in infected animals after the administration of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was evaluated by measurement of the concentrations of the substances present in specimens collected at the sites of infection. the results showed that both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid were well distributed in the animal body after the administration of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid formulations, being present in significant concentrations at various sites of infection, e.g., peritoneal washings, pleural fluid, pus, and infected tissue homogenates. in a number of cases, the amoxicillin concentrations measured after  the administration of brl 25000 were higher than those found after treatment with amoxicillin alone, presumably as a result of inhibition of bacterial beta-lactamases by clavulanic acid at the site of infection. the ability of clavulanic acid to protect amoxicillin in vivo was confirmed by the efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid formulations in the treatment of the infections studied, most of which were refractory to therapy with amoxicillin.

TI  == ceftriaxone: in vitro activity against 410 bacterial isolates compared with cefotaxime.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the two new cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone,  against 410 bacterial isolates was compared using an agar dilution method. both compounds were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus and providencia; the great majority of the isolates were  inhibited by 0.06 mg/l of either drug. activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus was moderate, and enterococci were resistant. all streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to 0.03 mg/l of either drug. the isolates belonging to  the bacteroides fragilis group were inhibited over a wide range of concentrations and some were highly resistant (mic greater than or equal to 64 mg/l). there were no significant differences in the antibacterial activity of the two drugs against our isolates. both drugs may be of potential use in the treatment of serious infections caused by enterobacteriaceae; they may prove to be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides.

TI  == the history and background of augmentin.
AB  == bacterial resistance to the beta-lactam group of antibiotics is frequently due to the production of beta-lactamase which brings about the inactivation of the antibiotic. clavulanic acid is a naturally occurring inhibitor of beta-lactamase  which is capable of rendering penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant organisms sensitive. the compound is obtained by fermentation from streptomyces clavuligerus. clavulanic acid shows some structural similarity to the penicillins and cephalosporins and functions as a progressive inhibitor of a wide range of beta-lactamases including those found in escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes,  proteus species, bacteroides fragilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococcus aureus. clavulanic acid is well absorbed when given by mouth and a formulation with amoxycillin (augmentin; beechams) is now available for clinical use.

AB  == organisms that are present in the normal faecal flora, especially bacteroides fragilis, were isolated significantly more often from perirectal abscesses associated with a fistula. other organisms similar to those associated with infection of obstructed apocrine glands at other sites were isolated from abscesses without fistulas. these findings suggest that perirectal abscesses with and without fistulas may have a different aetiology and that appropriate bacteriological investigation may give an indication of the presence of an unsuspected fistula and thus provide useful guidance to the correct surgical management of the patient. staphylococcus aureus and other skin organisms were found less frequently than in previous studies on perirectal sepsis and were equally common in cases with or without a fistula-in-ano.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefotetan, a new cephamycin derivative, compared with that of other beta-lactam compounds.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefotetan, a new cephamycin, was compared with the activities of cefoxitin, cefuroxime, moxalactam, ceftazidime, and piperacillin against 273 recent clinical isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefotetan for 90% of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae were between 0.12 and 2 micrograms/ml; for 90% of staphylococcus aureus, the minimum inhibitory concentration was 8 micrograms/ml, and for 90% of  bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lancefield group d streptococci it was 128 micrograms/ml or more. the activity of cefotetan against enterobacteriaceae is comparable to the activities of ceftazidime and moxalactam  and four to eight times greater than the activities of cefoxitin and cefuroxime.  cefotetan was approximately one-half as active as cefoxitin and cefuroxime against s. aureus. although cefotetan was 87% bound to serum protein, serum had little effect on the in vitro antimicrobial activity of this agent.

AB  == ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. the bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. there were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. no serious drug toxicities were observed. at a dosage regimen of 1 g  every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.

TI  == obturator foramen grafts: the preferable alternate route?
AB  == although the femoral canal is the standard entrance route for vascular grafts to  the lower extremity, several situations may arise that preclude the use of this route. in these circumstances an alternate pathway for revascularization is required. experience in our center with the use of obturator foramen grafts for revascularization of nine limbs in eight patients is reported and underscores the value of this pathway as an alternative route for limb revascularization. the obturator foramen was employed to circumvent an infected arterial prosthesis at the groin level in seven patients (eight limbs) from 12 days to 4.5 years after the initial vascular procedure. the organisms responsible for graft infection included staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, and bacteroides fragilis. the final patient required iliac to superficial femoral artery bypass via the obturator foramen to manage occlusion and autolysis of the femoral artery by a mycotic embolus containing beta-hemolytic streptococcus. graft material used for  these remedial procedures, included saphenous vein (three), gore-tex (three), and dacron (three). revascularization was satisfactory in each case. each groin infection healed. two patients died of unrelated causes at 1.5 and 5 months after operation. the seven remaining grafts at risk (six patients) remained patent 12 months in each case. four grafts were doing well at 18, 36, 50, and 52 months. three grafts failed at 13, 19, and 28 months; one was revised successfully, one was re-done and failed again. obturator foramen bypass grafting provides satisfactory and durable revascularization when an alternate route to the lower extremity is required.

TI  == cefmenoxime (sce-1365), a new cephalosporin: in vitro activity, comparison with other antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase stability, and disk diffusion testing  with tentative interpretive criteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365) was evaluated in a multiphased collaborative investigation. over 7,500 consecutive clinical isolates were tested in five laboratories, and greater than 90% of the following organisms were inhibited by cefmenoxime at the following concentrations: enterobacteriaceae and  non-enterococcal streptococci, </=0.125 mug/ml; staphylococcus aureus, </=2.0 mug/ml; and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli and bacteroides fragilis group, </=32 mug/ml. both beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by cefmenoxime at </=0.03 mug/ml. the spectrum of cefmenoxime was similar to that of other, newer cephalosporins, particularly cefotaxime. a pronounced inoculum effect was found with some species upon increasing inocula from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units per ml, resulting in an approximate eightfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations. cefmenoxime was bactericidal when tested with inocula  of 10(5) colonyforming units per ml, and mean differences between the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum lethal concentration were less than one  log(2) dilution. no significant hydrolysis of cefmenoxime by five different beta-lactamases was detectable, and cefmenoxime exhibited marked inhibition of type i beta-lactamases. regression and error rate-bounded analyses of results of  disk diffusion and reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on 421 bacterial isolates, and the following tentative zone size breakpoints are proposed: >/=22 mm, susceptible; </=14 mm, resistant; and 15 to 21 mm, moderately susceptible (indeterminate). these data and cross-resistance studies with other newer cephalosporins indicate marked similarity of in vitro activity within this group of drugs, particularly between cefmenoxime, moxalactam, and cefotaxime. any one of these could serve as the representative for the disk diffusion testing of this group of drugs if comparable minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints were used for each drug.

AB  == we have examined the relationship between the genes specifying resistance towards macrolid-lincosamide-streptogramin-b-type (mls) antibiotics from group d and h streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus licheniformis, and bacteroides fragilis by dna annealing. we detected homology between the mls resistance determinants from the gram-positive cocci (streptococci and staphylococci) but not between these and the genes from b. licheniformis and b. fragilis. based on these dna-dna hybridizations and on data obtained from the literature, at least four distinct classes of mls r determinants could be defined: classes a and b for the gram-positive cocci, class c for b. licheniformis and class d and b. fragilis. these genetic classes did not correlate with differences in phenotypic  expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards mls antibiotics. these findings are in favor of a recent common origin of r determinants in streptococci and staphylococci but do not suggest that gene transfer may occur between gram-positive cocci and anaerobes (b. fragilis) despite the fact that these pathogenic bacterial genera share common human eco-systems.

AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). a total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). a total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). the predominant aerobic isolates were s. epidermidis, s. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas sp., and group d streptococcus. the predominant anaerobic isolates were: p. acnes, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and bacteroides sp. blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: s. aureus, e. coli, peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and b. fragilis. the numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). gram-negative enteric rods and group d streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and p. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. all children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. these data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.

TI  == cefoperazone and cefotiam--two new cephalosporins: an in-vitro comparison.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefoperazone (cpz) and cefotiam (ctm) was compared to other available cephalosporins. using an agar dilution procedure both ctm and cpz were more active against the enterobacteriaceae tested than cefoxitin, cefuroxime and cefazolin; ctm being slightly more active than cpz, in particular against klebsiella spp haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to cpz. ctm had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa but cpz exhibited considerable activity (mode mic 4 mg/l). against bacteroides fragilis cpz had a similar activity to cefuroxime, but ctm was less active. ctm was about twice as active as cpz against staphylococcus aureus, cefazolin being the most active agent tested. the mbc was  about twice the mic for each compound and the presence of 75% serum had only a modest effect on the mic and mbc. the protein binding of cpz was 94% and ctm 62%.

AB  == adenoids were obtained from 18 children with chronic adenotonsillitis (group a) and from 12 others with adenoid hypertrophy (group b). patients' ages ranged from 20 months to 15 years (mean 6 years); 18 were males and 12 females. the adenoids  were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface, and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.6 anaerobes and 3.2 aerobes) per specimen. there were 97 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates in both groups were: bacteroides sp. (including b. melaninogenicus and b. oralis), fusobacterium sp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and veillonella sp. there were 138 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates in both groups were: alpha and gamma hemolytic streptococci, beta hemolytic streptococci (group a, b, c, and f), s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and hemophilus sp. hemophilus influenzae type b, and s. aureus were more frequently isolated in group a. b. fragilis was only recovered in group a. beta lactamase production was noted in 27 isolates obtained from 18 patients. fifteen of these patients belonged to group a (83% of group a), while 3 were members of group b (25% of group b). these bacteria were all isolates of s. aureus (11) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 22 b. melaninogenicus group, 4 of 11 b. oralis, and two of 8 h. influenza type b. our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep adenoid flora and demonstrate the presence of many beta lactamase-producing organisms in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of s. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less  than 0.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less  active than cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa. presence of serum, alteration of ph, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels.  bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some enterobacter, proteus, and bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.

TI  == comparative in vitro studies of ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative, was compared with the activities of cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against 591 clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. the spectra of activity and potency of ro 13-9904 and cefotaxime were  quite similar; they were the most active agents against enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis. moxalactam was only slightly less active against these organisms. ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam were approximately equal in activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa; concentrations of 50 to 100 microgram/ml inhibited over 90% of the strains tested. cefamandole and cephalothin were the most active drugs tested against staphylococci. moxalactam demonstrated the highest intrinsic activity against bacteroides fragilis; a concentration of 1.6 microgram/ml inhibited over 50% of the strains. all six of the antibiotics were essentially inactive against group d streptococci. the action of all of the antibiotics was bactericidal, with minimal bactericidal concentrations generally  being no more than twofold greater than minimal inhibitory concentrations. the only exception to this was found when large inocula of staphylococcus aureus were tested. increased inoculum size generally sharply reduced the activity of ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == selected postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in colo-rectal surgery on the basis of bacterial concentration in the operative field.
AB  == a new approach to antibiotic prophylaxis was tested in a prospective study of postoperative septic complications in elective colo-rectal surgery. the degree of contamination in the operative field in a nontreated group was estimated by dipslide technique. when the slide yielded greater than or equal to 5 cfu of a coliform bacterium or s. aureus the patient was judged to be contaminated. this trait was significantly correlated to the development of postoperative infection. all contaminated cases in another group of patients were subjects to prophylaxis  within 24 hours after peritoneal closure, using an antibiotic with a favourable mic concerning the current bacterium (-iae). this resulted in a significant reduction of the rate of infection. these findings challenge the current concept  of a very limited effective period of prophylactic systemic antibiotics.

AB  == this prospective study of elective cholecystectomy investigated the frequency and type of bacteria in gallbladder bile at operation, the factors predicting the presence of bacteria in bile, and the relationship between bacteria in bile and subsequent wound sepsis. in 148 consecutive cases 23% of bile cultures were positive. the overall wound infection rate was 15%, but 91% of all wound infections occurred in patients with positive bile cultures. eighty-five per cent of all positive bile cultures and 86% of all wound infections occurred in 37% of  the patients, characterized by age over 60 years and/or a history of previous attacks of acute cholecystitis. we suggest that in elective cholecystectomy prophylactic antibiotics should be restricted to this group of patients to limit  the use of antibiotics.

TI  == the treatment of the carrier state of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci with clindamycin.
AB  == 20 children who were chronic carriers of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) were treated with oral clindamycin. surface tonsillar cultures were obtained prior to therapy and 2 weeks after termination of therapy. they were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. prior to therapy, the average yield was 9  isolates (5 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.7 isolates (3 aerobes and 2.7 anaerobes). gabhs, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and bacteroides oralis were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy and the number of isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus and fusobacterium sp. was reduced. beta lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 21 isolates recovered from 16 tonsillar surfaces (80%). these included all isolates of s. aureus (8) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 18 b. melaninogenicus (44%), and 3 of 5 b. oralis (60%). only  one isolate of beta-lactamase-producing strain of b. melaninogenicus was recovered after conclusion of therapy. follow-up of the patients for 18 - 24 months (average 22 months) showed no recurrence of gabhs in 19 of the 20 children.

TI  == comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against salmonella typhi.
AB  == piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of salmonella typhi. piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. the relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. in addition, piperacillin was assessed  in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. this investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. s. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) cfu, and inocula of 10(2) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) cfu. piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. combinations of piperacillin  with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against pseudomonas and serratia isolates. less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against klebsiella and indole-positive proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin  or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.

TI  == synergistic activity of piperacillin in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  == clavulanic acid and a penicillanic acid sulfone, when combined individually with  piperacillin, synergistically inhibited various enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis. clavulanic acid and piperacillin synergistically inhibited 91 of 170 (55%) isolates tested. synergy was most often found against piperacillin-resistant bacteria: 65 of 69 isolates (94%). although  the penicillanic acid sulfone acted synergistically with piperacillin, inhibiting 62 of 170 strains (33%), the concentration of clavulanic acid required for synergy generally was less than that of penicillanic acid sulfone. combination of piperacillin and cefotaxime, an inhibitor of type 1 beta-lactamases, rarely was synergistic and was antagonistic for several species. the combination of piperacillin with potent beta-lactamase inhibitors made piperacillin active against those isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella and bacteroides species, as well as selected other species, that are resistant to piperacillin by virtue of their production of beta-lactamases.

TI  == host factors in the formation of abscesses.
AB  == the role of host factors in the formation of subcutaneous abscesses due to bacteroides fragilis or staphylococcus aureus was investigated in athymic nude mice, mice deficient in the fifth component of complement (c5d), and mice pretreated with cobra venom factor (cvf). cvf-treated mice, inoculated with b. fragilis, had abscesses 62% larger than those of control mice at day 4 (p < 0.01), but no significant difference was observed when s. aureus was used. athymic nude mice had significantly smaller abscesses than control animals at both days 4 and 7 after inoculation with either organism. there were no differences in abscess size or in the accumulation of neutrophils at day 4 when c5d mice were compared with control animals for either organism. the results suggested that the activity of the alternative complement pathway may influence abscess size and that chemotactic factors other than the fifth component of complement can supervene in c5d mice to produce encapsulated abscesses. the absence of thymic factors did not prevent containment of abscesses.

TI  == bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia in children.
AB  == aspiration pneumonia in adults has been shown to involve anaerobes about 90% of the time. studies of the bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia in children done in the past have either failed to exclude the oral and upper respiratory tract flora or have not utilized proper anaerobic culture techniques or both. in the present  study. 74 institutionalized children with aspiration pneumonia were studied by percutaneous transtracheal aspiration. their average age was 8 years. fifty-two patients had pneumonitis, 12, necrotizing pneumonia, and 10, lung abscess. only one patient (with lung abscess) had a complicating empyema. there was an average  of five bacteria isolated per specimen--2.8 anaerobes and 2.2 nonanaerobes. the predominant anaerobic isolates were gram-positive cocci, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and fuso-bacteria; there were ten patients who yielded members of the bacteroides fragilis group. the predominant nonanaerobes were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. thus, aspiration pneumonia in children, as in adults, commonly involves anaerobic bacteria. when aspiration occurs in a medical institution, nosocomial pathogens which are aerobic or facultative will also often be involved, in both children and adults.

AB  == strains of bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics have been increasing in  number and are becoming troublesome in clinical medicine. the in vitro antibacterial activity of amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid was determined on selected ampicillin-resistant clinical isolates. synergistic effects were produced by amoxicillin with clavulanic acid against ampicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and bacteroides fragilis. inhibition of the beta-lactamases produced by the ampicillin-resistant  strains was confirmed, especially against the penicillinases mediated by the r factor and the cephalosporinases produced by p.vulgaris and b. fragilis. the inhibitory effect of clavulanic acid against beta-lactamases was irreversible because of the high affinity of clavulanic acid to the enzymes.

AB  == to compare the in vitro activity of moxalactam (ly127935), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, each drug was tested against 420 bacterial isolates from the blood of septic patients. standard broth dilution methods were  used to determine minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations. ly127935 was as active as the aminoglycosides against aerobic gram-negative organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was at least 10-fold more active than the other beta-lactam agents against these bacteria. ly127935 was the most active agent tested against bacteroides fragilis; its activity against all other anaerobic bacteria and staphylococcus aureus was similar to those of the other agents tested. all streptococci, however, grew at higher concentrations of ly127935 than any other drug, and streptococcus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes were not inhibited at the highest concentration tested (minimum inhibitory concentration, > 64 microgram/ml). although a greater proportion of blood culture isolates were susceptible to ly127935 than to any other drug tested, ly127935 does not have a sufficiently broad spectrum of in vitro activity to be recommended safely alone for empirical treatment of sepsis of unknown etiology.

TI  == a quantitative model for subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the purpose of this experiment was to develop an experimental model of s.c. encapsulated abscesses in which abscess formation could be assessed by quantitative measurements. inocula were composed of bacterial broth cultures, autoclaved mouse caecal contents or both in combination. these inocula were injected s.c. on the flank in 2 strains of mice. large encapsulated abscesses formed in all recipients by day 4 when the inoculum contained either b. fragilis  or s. aureus combined with caecal contents. bacterial concentrations per ml of pus at day 6 were 10(10.1+/-0.02) for b. fragilis and 10(8.4+/-0.1) for s. aureus. spontaneous external drainage began by 10--15 days, and complete healing  of the lesion occurred by 4--6 weeks. the typical histological pattern consisted  of a collagen capsule surrounding a rim of neutrophils, enclosing a central area  of necrotic cells and fibre from the inoculum. the cross-sectional areas of the capsule, the neutrophil band and the entire abscess were measured in a reproducible manner by planimetry, and abscess volumes were calculated. values for these measurements varied with different inocula and different times after inoculation, but were highly consistent for a specified time and inoculum.

AB  == although the incidence of infection secondary to the bites of venomous snakes remains unknown, the routine use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is advocated. in this study, the venom from 15 rattlesnakes was cultured, and 58 aerobic and 28 anaerobic strains of bacteria were isolated. the most common species isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, coagulase-negative staphylocci, and clostridium species. bacteroides fragilis was also recovered. when the fang sheaths of four additional rattlesnakes were retracted and the fangs of these snakes decontaminated, 50% of the samples of venom had no bacterial growth (p = 0.035). until a clinical study is performed, the use of antimicrobial therapy that reflects that complex oral flora of rattlesnakes is still recommended in most cases of envenomization.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == bacterial colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia following tracheostomy and long-term intubation in pediatric patients.
AB  == serial tracheal cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from 27 pediatric patients during one year of follow-up. the patients had required tracheostomy and prolonged intubation for periods ranging from 3 to 12 months (average, 7 1/2 months). cultures of tracheal aspirates yielded 1,508 isolates of pathogenic aerobic (969 isolates) and anaerobic (539 isolates) bacteria. the most frequent aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus. the predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides fragilis. replacement of one pathogen by another occurred frequently. tracheobronchitis occurred in 24 patients, all of whom had episodes of pneumonia. the data suggest that anaerobic bacteria are a part of the bacterial flora in colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia in  patients with tracheostomy and prolonged intubation.

TI  == ly127935, a novel oxa-beta-lactam: an in vitro comparison with other beta-lactam  antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ly127935 (ly) were compared with those of other beta-lactam antibiotics. ly was highly active (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic] range 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml) against the common enterobacteriaceae (including providencia stuartiia, enterobacter, and serrati marcescens), 8 to 16  times more active than cefoxitin, cefuroxime, or cefazolin, and from one-half to  one-eighth as active as cefotaxime (hr756). the activity of ly against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 4 and 64 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of test strains, respectively) was essentially similar to that of cefotaxime, but was only one-half as active as cgp 7174/e. ly, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime were essentially equally active against bacteroides fragilis--each was more active than cefuroxime and cefazolin. against staphylococcus aureus, ly (50% mic and 90% mic of 4 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively) was less active than cefotaxime, cefoxitin, or cefuroxime and one-eighth as active as cefazolin. the composition and ph of the culture medium had little effect on the activity of ly, although 7.2 appeared to be the optimum ph.

AB  == the activity of ly127935, a beta-lactam antibiotic of novel structure, was studied in vitro against facultative gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis. the strains were recent clinical isolates, many of which were relatively resistant to other antibiotics. ly127935 exhibited striking activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., proteus sp., serratia marcescens, and b. fragilis with median minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was somewhat less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus. cefotaxime (hr 756) showed very similar activity except that it was substantially weaker against b. fragilis. ly127935 was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, or piperacillin; it was also as potent as tobramycin or amikacin against all species except for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == microbiology of superficial and deep tissues in infected diabetic gangrene.
AB  == in the current study, it is shown that, in the lesions of diabetic gangrene, there are usually mixed flora of two or more organisms. the organisms isolated from the presenting lesion may only partially reflect the organisms found in the  deep tissues. of the 58 cultures from the deep tissues, 11 of the isolates were anaerobes, but those anaerobes were never isolated as a pure culture. bacterial synergism probably plays a role in infected diabetic gangrene. maximizing the reduction of systemic infection and local cellulitis by elevation and appropriate antibiotic therapy results in improved wound healing in amputations of the lower  extremities in patients with diabetic gangrene. however, apparent from this study, antibiotic therapy does not eradicate the organisms in the deep tissue, and surgical procedures are usually required for definitive treatment. material from the surgically removed infected tissue should always be cultured for identification of existing organisms. when indicated, appropriate adjustment of antibiotic therapy, based upon these findings, should be prescribed.

TI  == the fetid foot: lower-extremity infections in patients with diabetes mellitus.
AB  == infections of the lower extremities in patients with diabetes mellitus have been  attributed to staphylococcus aureus and other facultatively anaerobic bacteria. however, a review of 30 consecutive diabetics who required surgery for lower-extremity infections revealed that 17 had mixed infections due to both obligate and facultative anaerobes; only six had infections due to s. aureus. mixed infections often had characteristics of anaerobic suppuration and responded poorly to therapy. patients with mixed infections required more operations than did those with staphylococcal infections, and their surgical wounds healed more slowly. seven patients had infections with mixed enteric bacteria (neither anaerobes nor s. aureus), and their response to therapy was intermediate between  that of the patients with mixed anaerobic infections and those with staphylococcal infections. nine additional patients with mixed anaerobic infections were treated with cefoxitin; three required amputations at a level above the ankle, but six patients improved and required only limited surgery that preserved foot function. bacteroides fragilis was the anaerobe isolated most often. cefoxitin (less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml) inhibited all of the anaerobes isolated from the nine patients and 97% of an additional 135 consecutive clinical isolates of b. fragilis; 98% of 54 strains of bacteroides oralis and all of 34 strains of bacteroides melaninogenicus were also inhibited.  these in vitro results and the results of our clinical study show that cefoxitin  is a promising antibiotic for therapy of foot infections due to a mixed flora of  anaerobes in diabetics.

AB  == of 22 patients who were suspected of having bacterial endocarditis and who were treated with cefoxitin intravenously (8-12 g per day), 12 were evaluated for responses to therapy. ten patients had infections due to a single pathogen, and two had polymicrobial infections. staphylococci were isolated from eight patients, and streptococci from four; both of these pathogens were susceptible to 2-16 micrograms of cefoxitin/ml. staphylococcus aureus and four strains of anaerobic bacteria, including bacteroides fragilis (minimal inhibitory concentration, 32 micrograms/ml), were isolated from one patient. the average level of cefoxitin in serum was 32.8 micrograms/ml (range, 14.5-64 micrograms/ml) at 1 hr after an intravenous dose of 2 g; after 5 hr the average level in serum was 8.5 micrograms/ml (range, 2-20 micrograms/ml). the mean (+/- sd) level of cefoxitin in myocardial tissues from eight rabbits at 1 hr following a 250-mg/kg  dose of the antibiotic was 4 +/- 0.5 micrograms/g. on the average, patients were  treated for 29 days (range, 14-40 days), and they became afebrile in 6.2 days (range, three to 20 days). both clinical and microbiologic responses to cefoxitin therapy were excellent in 10 patients with monobacterial infections. both patients with polymicrobial infections were not cured. one, who was infected with a mixed flora of anaerobes, died; the other was cured after surgical valvectomy.  these results suggest that cefoxitin is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to a single susceptible organism but that this antibiotic should be used with caution in patients whose endocarditis is caused by a mixed population of bacterial pathogens.

(5) and staphylococcus aureus (3). there were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and bacteroides sp., the latter of which included bacteroides fragilis group and bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). the patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. the clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. there were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. the above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic  and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.

AB  == cutaneous abscesses in the perineal region contain primarily anaerobes commonly found in stool. non-perineal abscesses contain mixed microflora indigenous to the skin. bacteroides fragilis, the only anaerobe resistant to penicillin, is found predominantly in the perineal area. staphylococcus aureus, although the most common aerobe found, is seen less frequently than expected and is almost always resistant to penicillin. escherichia coli and neisseria gonorrhoeae are rarely found. incision and drainage is the primary mode of treatment. fever is rare, though tachycardia is common in patients with normal host defenses. patients with altered host defenses may require initial culture and gram-stained smear to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy. the gram-stained smear reliably indicates sterile and mixed abscesses, as well as those containing pure s aureus. incision and drainage alone is the only therapy required in the usual patient. since in these patients antibiotics are not required, initial culture and gram-stained smear are unnecessary.

TI  == prophylactic systemic antibiotics in colorectal surgery.
AB  == the prophylactic value of gentamicin combined with either lincomycin or metronidazole in 52 patients undergoing colorectal surgery was investigated. the  results confirmed the value of this practice. in a control group, the sepsis-rate was 48% with 1 death attributable to sepsis, compared with a sepsis-rate of 4% in the treated group. the combination of gentamicin and lincomycin was effective against sepsis but pseudomembranous colitis developed in 2 of the 14 patients treated with this combination of drugs. lincomycin was discontinued, and when metronidazole was substituted the results were equally good and there were no toxic side-effects.

TI  == anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology in head and neck cancer surgery.
AB  == a prospective study of wound infections following major head and neck cancer surgery was undertaken to define a rational approach to trials of antibiotic prophylaxis and initial therapy of these infections. preoperative aerobic cultures were taken from the planned site of skin incision and from the oropharynx. both aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from all wound infections. patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics were excluded from the study. the data indicate that preoperative cultures are not usually predictive of the bacteriology of subsequent wound infection. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were cultured from most wound infections, and usually reflected normal anaerobic  oropharyngeal flora, exogenously acquired staphylococcus aureus, or both. bacteroides fragilis was not cultured in this series. antibiotics selected for trials of prophylaxis or initial treatment of these infections should cover both  the resident oral aerobic and anaerobic flora and s aureus. coverage for b fragilis does not appear necessary. antibiotic choices might include penicillin g plus a penicillinase-resistant penicillin or a parenteral cephalosporin.

TI  == effect of dilution on recovery of bacteria from blood.
AB  == the multiplication rate of bacteria in undiluted blood containing sodium polyanethol sulfonate was compared with growth rates obtained in dilutions of blood ranging from 1:2 to 1:8. although all organisms tested grew in the undiluted blood, increased growth rates were seen in the 1:2 dilution. further dilution resulted in growth rates equivalent to that obtained with the 1:2 dilution. in view of these results, we question the present recommendations that  blood be diluted 1:10 or 1:20.

TI  == empiric treatment with clindamycin and gentamicin of suspected sepsis due to anaerobic and aerobic bacteria.
AB  == clindamycin and gentamicin were used in combination to treat 107 patients empirically for suspected aerobic-anaerobic sepsis. all patients were seriously ill and required initiation of treatment before results of cultures could be obtained. infections included intraabdominal sepsis, hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia, and soft tissue infections. exudate cultured from 65 patients showed that the prediction of a mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora was correct in 46 patients (71%). isolates from exudate included escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridia, peptostreptococci, proteus species, klebsiella species, and staphylococcus aureus. in 29 patients with bacteremia, the most frequent blood culture isolate was b. fragilis. analysis of response to treatment showed that 92 patients were cured, five could not be evaluated adequately, and 10 failed to respond to therapy. therapeutic failure primarily resulted from overwhelming sepsis, despite susceptibility of the pathogens to prescribed antibiotics.

TI  == neonatal sepsis at the johns hopkins hospital, 1969-1975: bacterial isolates and  clinical correlates.
AB  == the experience with neonatal sepsis at the johns hopkins hospital during 1969-1975 was reviewed. major pathogens included escherichia coli, group b streptococcus, other streptococci, and klebsiella. nineteen percent of coliform isolates were kanamycin-resistant. the frequency of recovery of e. coli was increased in early-onset sepsis, and the frequency of recovery of klebsiella was  increased in late-onset sepsis. the mortality rate was 23%. the frequency of recovery of e. coli was increased in fatal cases, and mortality was highly correlated with the presence of gastrointestinal catastrophe. ampicillin and gentamicin are the initial antibiotics of choice for neonatal sepsis at this institution; a penicillinase-resistant penicillin should be added when staphylococcus aureus involvement is likely, and addition of chloramphenicol or clindamycin should be considered for infants at increased risk for bacteroides fragilis sepsis.

TI  == development of a lysis-filtration blood culture technique.
AB  == a lysed-blood culture system that quickly lyses patients' blood near neutrality and is relatively noninjurious to more delicate pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae and bacteroides fragilis is reported. the lysing solution includes culture medium, 0.004 m sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, 0.04% triton x-100,and  0.6% rhozyme (a mixture of proteases). most of the pathogens tested multiplied in the lysing solution. the lysed blood normally is immediately filtered. the membrane is transferred to culture broth. the greatest advantage realized from this blood culture technique is separation of pathogens from antibiotics, bactericidal antibodies, complement, opsonins, and phagocytic systems. another advantage is the concentration of organisms into a small volume of clear medium for faster growth and visualization of growth. it was observed that both gram-negative and -positive organisms were attracted during filtration to the filter material and were not removed from it by backwashing with buffer. thus, filter membranes with porosities much larger than would nominally be expected to  retain bacteria retained all or part of light and heavy escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus suspensions. advantage may be taken of this phenomenon to use filters with larger pore sizes and avoid filter clogging by poorly lysed specimens. porr lysis may result from addition of too much blood to the lysing solution, blood with elevated numbers of erythrocytes or leukocytes, or blood from some people whose blood is naturally more resistant to lysis.

TI  == prophylactic lincomycin in the prevention of wound infection following appendicectomy: a double blind study.
AB  == the prophylactic use of a single dose of lincomycin in 100 patients undergoing appendicectomy reduced the incidence of postoperative wound infection from 17 to  6 per cent compared with a similar group of control patients. there was no correlation with the histological finding in the appendix, but patients with perforated appendicitis were excluded from the study. bacteriological examination of the appendix area before surgery showed that bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli were the organisms most frequently isolated. the majority of wound infections were due to b. fragilis, either alone or in association with aerobic organisms, but infection due to e. coli and staphylococcus aureus also occurred. systemic antibiotic therapy can successfully reduce the complications following appendicectomy but it is necessary to use a compound with activity against anaerobic organisms.

TI  == a gram stain for smears of blood cultures, body fluids and tissues.
AB  == a new gram stain method for blood cultures was adapted from a method for tissue sections. this was accomplished by comparing various modifications of the latter  method on positive smears prepared from a 24-hour negative blood culture seeded with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. a blind study was then conducted using the new method and hucker's method on 24-hour and 72-hour blood cultures as well as a limited number of other body fluids and tissues. of the 35 positive blood cultures detected by the new method, the hucker method failed to detect 14  positive specimens (40 per cent) upon initial examination. ten additional cultures were negative using both stains, but were positive on subculture at three days. the 18 additional cultures positive after ten days were detected using only the hucker stain.

TI  == in vitro activity of josamycin against aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobes.
AB  == josamycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, was compared with ampicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin in vitro against 25 isolates each of pneumococci, enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and nonenterococcal hemolytic streptococci and against 25 anaerobes including 10 bacteroides fragilis. minimal  inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration data were obtained for the aerobic organisms, using serial twofold tube dilutions in mueller-hinton broth. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined for the anaerobes by the agar dilution technique. josamycin was comparable to erythromycin and clindamycin in activity against the pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci and was more active than clindamycin against enterococci. it was somewhat less active than ampicillin against enterococci and s. epidermidis and showed its greatest in vitro activity against anaerobes, being comparable to  clindamycin.

TI  == activity of cefamandole and other cephalosporins against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of cefamandole was comparable to that of cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephaloridine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae. in contrast, cefamandole was considerably more active than cephalothin, cefazolin, or cephaloridine against gram-negative facultative bacilli, including haemophilus influenzae, the most striking disparities being noted with indole-positive proteus and enterobacter. bacteroides fragilis was more susceptible to cefoxitin than to cefamandole or cefazolin (median minimal inhibitory concentration, approximately 8, 32, and 32 mug/ml, respectively); cephalothin exhibited still less activity against this species. the majority of other anaerobes were inhibited by relatively low concentrations of all four cephalosporins. the results indicate a potentially valuable role for cefamandole  against facultative gram-negative bacilli, including h. influenzae, but no exceptional activity against anaerobes.

TI  == antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  == it has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. this was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. in similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.

TI  == survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in a nonsupportive gassed transport system.
AB  == survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in a commercially available, non-supportive, gassed (oxygen-free) transport container (anaport) was evaluated  quantitatively. saline-suspended obligate anaerobes survived significantly better in the gassed container in aerobic control tubes (p less than 0.025, t test), and counts were virtually unchanged after 8 h of holding. similarly, initial counts and relative proportions of a mixture of bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus  aureus were maintained for 72 h. the value of the gassed transport system was less apparent when microorganisms were suspended in nutrient broth. the major advantage of the gassed transport system appears to be for holding of specimens collected by saline irrigation.

TI  == survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == serum proteins of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == cellulose-acetate and agar gel immunoelectrophoresis were used to study the serum protein patterns of germfree rats before and after monoassociation with a pure culture of staphylococcus aureus (phage type 80/81), streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or proteus vulgaris. all six bacteria quickly established themselves in the gastrointestinal tract of the germfree rat, and all six increased the animals' total serum proteins. only s. aureus and p. aeruginosa caused a noticeable rise in gamma globulins. l. acidophilus, s. faecalis, and b. fragilis multiplied readily in the gastrointestinal tract but caused only minimal alterations in the  serum proteins. p. vulgaris caused a marked increase in the alpha and beta, but not the gamma globulins.
