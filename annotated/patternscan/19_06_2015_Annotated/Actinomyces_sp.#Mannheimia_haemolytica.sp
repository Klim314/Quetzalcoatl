TI  == otitis in cattle, an aetiological review.
AB  == otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus raillietia. its prevalence is higher in mature and zebu cattle. in advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory  diseases and mixed infection. the principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as actinomyces spp., corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, escherichia coli, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas spp., streptococcus spp. and mycoplasma bovis. the control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == clinical efficacy of florfenicol in the treatment of calf respiratory tract infections.
AB  == this paper reports on a study of the aetiology of calf pneumonia and the clinical efficacy of florfenicol, a new antibiotic in turkey. twenty-seven weaned and unweaned calves (13 males and 14 females) between 1 and 16 months of age brought  to the clinics of selcuk university, faculty of veterinary science. broncho-alveolar lavage (bal) fluid samples were taken from the animals diagnosed to have upper respiratory tract infection associated with bronchitis (n=2), bronchitis (n=5), bronchopneumonia (n=4), pneumonia (n=3), pleuropneumonia (n=11), bronchopneumonia plus pulmonary oedema (n=2) based on the results of the  clinical and laboratory examinations. then microbiological isolation and antibiotic culturing were performed. the animals were treated with 1 ml/15 kg (20 mg/kg) florfenicol (nuflor, dif) twice within 48 hours via intramuscular injection. at the end of the treatment, 23 of the weaned and unweaned calves were completely healed, 1 calf had died and 3 calves showed no healing. the results of bal samples and microbiological examinations of the 3 calves that did not respond to the treatment indicated that these cases were affected by mixed infections of  yeasts, fungi, and bacteria. widespread pleuropneumonia was observed. according to the results of the microbiological examination of the bal samples, mannheimia  (pasteurella) haemolytica had the highest isolation rate (25%) compared with the  other isolated bacteria, namely, klebsiella pneumonia (20%), actinomyces pyogenes (15%), beta-hemolytic streptococci. (10%), staphylococcus spp. (5%), and e. coli  (5%). the study also revealed fungi [penicillum spp. (5%) and aspergillus spp. (5%)] and two calves (10%) had a yeast infection.. we conclude that florfenicol has a high bacteriological and clinical efficacy (100% and 96% respectively) in the treatment of calf respiratory tract diseases.

TI  == expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in spontaneous bovine bronchopneumonia.
AB  == the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), major histocompatibility class ii molecules (mhc-ii), cd68, and the calcium-binding proteins s100a8 and s100a9 (also called mrp8 and mrp14, respectively) was assessed in lung tissues from cattle that succumbed to pneumonia. expression patterns of these markers were related to the types of lung lesion. inos expression was only observed in lungs infected with arcanobacterium pyogenes or pasteurella haemolytica but not in lungs from cattle with subacute chronic interstitial pneumonia and acute interstitial pneumonia due to escherichia coli infection. high levels of inos were expressed by cells (probably leukocytes) surrounding necrotic foci. occasionally, inos was expressed by intraalveolar macrophages in viable parenchyma, by leukocytes within the airways, and by some chondrocytes in the supporting cartilage of bronchi. cells expressing mhc-ii were distributed relatively evenly throughout areas of inflammation and did not display any clear association with necrotic foci. cell types expressing mhc-ii included type ii alveolar epithelial cells, spindle-shaped cells of the interstitium, cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, and leukocytes in lymph and blood vessels but largely excluded inos-positive cells. likewise, cd68-positive cells were rarely positive for inos and were not confined to the areas surrounding necrotic tissue. as with mhc-ii and cd68, there was little if any coexpression of inos and either of the s100 proteins tested. thus, in cattle  with necrotizing bronchopneumonia, inos-expressing cells were largely restricted  to the cellular zone surrounding necrotic areas.

TI  == bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (h) versus unhealthy (uh) animals with respiratory signs. the prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper  and lower respiratory tract of h and uh najdi sheep, somali sheep and holstein calves. the characteristics of pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of pasteurella haemolytica were identified in h and uh animals, eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of uh najdi and somali sheep and holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of uh sheep were moraxella spp., pseudomonas pseudomallei, erysipelothrix spp., pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in uh calves were pasteurella haemolytica, actinomyces spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of uh animals, namely actinomyces pyogenes, erysipelothrix spp., p. haemolytica, pasteurella ureae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of  the animals surveyed. of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified p. haemolytica and p. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from uh  as compared to those from h animals. these were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of p. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of p. multocida recovered from healthy animals. the  only biotype of p. haemolytica isolated from h animals was biotype a, while both  biotypes a (88.0% of the isolates) and t (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from uh animals.
