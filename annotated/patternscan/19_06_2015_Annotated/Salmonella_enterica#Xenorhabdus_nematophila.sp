TI  == computational analysis of bacterial rna-seq data.
AB  == recent advances in high-throughput rna sequencing (rna-seq) have enabled tremendous leaps forward in our understanding of bacterial transcriptomes. however, computational methods for analysis of bacterial transcriptome data have  not kept pace with the large and growing data sets generated by rna-seq technology. here, we present new algorithms, specific to bacterial gene structures and transcriptomes, for analysis of rna-seq data. the algorithms are implemented in an open source software system called rockhopper that supports various stages of bacterial rna-seq data analysis, including aligning sequencing  reads to a genome, constructing transcriptome maps, quantifying transcript abundance, testing for differential gene expression, determining operon structures and visualizing results. we demonstrate the performance of rockhopper  using 2.1 billion sequenced reads from 75 rna-seq experiments conducted with escherichia coli, neisseria gonorrhoeae, salmonella enterica, streptococcus pyogenes and xenorhabdus nematophila. we find that the transcriptome maps generated by our algorithms are highly accurate when compared with focused experimental data from e. coli and n. gonorrhoeae, and we validate our system's ability to identify novel small rnas, operons and transcription start sites. our  results suggest that rockhopper can be used for efficient and accurate analysis of bacterial rna-seq data, and that it can aid with elucidation of bacterial transcriptomes.

TI  == clonal variation in xenorhabdus nematophila virulence and suppression of manduca  sexta immunity.
AB  == virulence of the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila is attributed in part to its ability to suppress immunity. for example, x. nematophila suppresses transcripts encoding several antimicrobial proteins, even in the presence of salmonella enterica, an inducer of these transcripts. we show here that virulence and immune suppression phenotypes can be lost in a subpopulation of x. nematophila. cells that have undergone 'virulence modulation' (vmo) have attenuated virulence and fail to suppress antimicrobial transcript levels, haemocyte aggregation and nodulation in manduca sexta insects. when plated on certain media, vmo cells have a higher proportion of translucent (versus opaque)  colonies compared with non-vmo cells. like vmo strains, translucent colony isolates are defective in virulence and immune suppression. the x. nematophila genome encodes two 'opacity' genes with similarity to the ail/pagc/rck family of  outer membrane proteins involved in adherence, invasion and serum resistance. quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis shows that rna levels of one of these opacity genes, opab, are higher in opaque relative to translucent colonies. we propose that in x. nematophila opab may be one of several factors involved in  immune suppression during infection, and expression of these factors can be co-ordinately eliminated in a subpopulation, possibly through a phase variation mechanism.
