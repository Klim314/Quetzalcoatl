biased distribution of dna uptake sequences towards genome maintenance genes.
repeated sequence signatures are characteristic features of all genomic dna. we have made a rigorous search for repeat genomic sequences in the human pathogens neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae and found that by far the most frequent 9-10mers residing within coding regions are the dna uptake sequences (dus) required for natural genetic transformation. more importantly, we found a significantly higher density of dus within genes involved in dna repair, recombination, restriction-modification and replication than in any other annotated gene group in these organisms. pasteurella multocida also displayed high frequencies of a putative dus identical to that previously identified in h.influenzae and with a skewed distribution towards genome maintenance genes, indicating that this bacterium might be transformation competent under certain conditions. these results imply that the high frequency of dus in genome maintenance genes is conserved among phylogenetically divergent species and thus are of significant biological importance. increased dus density is expected to enhance dna uptake and the over-representation of dus in genome maintenance genes might reflect facilitated recovery of genome preserving functions. for example, transient and beneficial increase in genome instability can be allowed during pathogenesis simply through loss of antimutator genes, since these dus-containing sequences will be preferentially recovered. furthermore, uptake of such genes could provide a mechanism for facilitated recovery from dna damage after genotoxic stress.
virulence of pasteurella multocida reca mutants.
in order to determine the role of the reca protein in the virulence of pasteurella multocida, a reca mutant was constructed and used in studies of virulence and competition in relation to wild-type strain. to achieve this, firstly, the reca gene was isolated and sequenced, showing an escherichia coli-like sos box and encoding a protein of 354 amino acids which has the closest identity with the haemophilus influenzae reca protein. further, the reca mutant was constructed, by inactivating this gene by single recombination of a suicide plasmid containing an internal region of the p. multocida reca gene, and shown to be more sensitive to uv radiation than the parental strain. the p. multocida mutant was slightly attenuated in virulence, as indicated by the ld(50), the time of death of infected animals, and a failure to compete with the wild-type strain in mixed infections. compared to the parent strain, the mutant had a similar growth rate but a longer lag phase. these data suggest that the diminished virulence of the reca mutant as well as its failure in competition were more a consequence of the long lag phase rather than a direct effect of the inactivation of the reca gene on genes involved in virulence.
erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin: use of frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance.
mics of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin for 852 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses were used to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance. clarithromycin was the most active drug against bacteroides spp. but the least active against haemophilus influenzae. azithromycin was most active against h. influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pasteurella multocida, and fusobacterium spp. but the least active against streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. all three drugs had equivalent activities against staphylococcus spp. and gram-positive anaerobes. none of the three drugs was particularly active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, although concentrations of 4 micrograms of azithromycin per ml inhibited some strains of the family enterobacteriaceae (particularly escherichia coli and citrobacter diversus) and acinetobacter baumannii. although relative drug activities varied by organism, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all; an exception was fusobacteria, which were usually susceptible only to azithromycin. cross-susceptibility and cross-resistance were, therefore, the rule (except for fusobacterium spp.), although the percentage of susceptible organisms could be varied considerably on the basis of the selection of breakpoints.
the development of macrolides: clarithromycin in perspective.
macrolide antibiotics have been available and used clinically since 1952. the class of drugs originated from a soil sample obtained from the city of ilo-ilo on the island of paray in the philippines. erythromycin has been the most widely used agent of this class called 'macrolides' because they possess the macrocyclic lactone nucleus. many esters of erythromycin are well established as agents to treat a variety of respiratory and cutaneous infections, particularly in children. there has been a resurgence of interest in macrolides as a result of the recognition of pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia and campylobacter spp. a number of new 14-membered macrolides have been synthesised in recent years with the goal of overcoming some of the problems of the older erythromycin agents. there has been variable activity of erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae; there has been gastrointestinal irritation, particularly in adults; and the older agents are administered four times a day. clarithromycin has increased activity against legionella, and branhamella spp., and pasteurella multocida, and, with its 14-oh metabolite, inhibits haemophilus spp. it is also more active against chlamydia and against anaerobic species while retaining excellent activity against streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae. it has increased plasma peak levels and a sufficiently long half-life for twice daily administration. furthermore, it is well tolerated. thus clarithromycin offers potential for use in those areas in which a safe, well tolerated macrolide will be used, namely respiratory, skin structure and selected diarrhoeal and genital infections.
