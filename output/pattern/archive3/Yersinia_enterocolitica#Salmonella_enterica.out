activity of a bacterial cell envelope stress response is controlled by the interaction of a protein binding domain with different partners.
the bacterial phage shock protein (psp) system is a highly conserved cell envelope stress response required for virulence in yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella enterica. in non-inducing conditions the transcription factor pspf is inhibited by an interaction with pspa. in contrast, pspa associates with the cytoplasmic membrane proteins pspbc during inducing conditions. this has led to the proposal that pspbc exists in an off state, which cannot recruit pspa, or an on state, which can. however, nothing was known about the difference between these two states. here, we provide evidence that it is the c-terminal domain of y. enterocolitica pspc (pspc(ct)) that interacts directly with pspa, both in vivo and in vitro. site-specific photocross-linking revealed that this interaction occurred only during psp-inducing conditions in vivo. importantly, we have also discovered that pspc(ct) can interact with the c-terminal domain of pspb (pspc(ct).pspb(ct)). however, the pspc(ct).pspb(ct) and pspc(ct).pspa interactions were mutually exclusive in vitro. furthermore, in vivo, pspc(ct) contacted pspb(ct) in the off state, whereas it contacted pspa in the on state. these findings provide the first description of the previously proposed pspbc off and on states and reveal that the regulatory switch is centered on a pspc(ct) partner-switching mechanism.
the expression of propionicin plg-1 gene (plg-1) by lactic starters.
propionicin plg-1 is a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p127. such bacteriocin inhibits wide range of food-borne pathogens such as pathogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio parahaemolyticus, yersinia enterocolitica and a strain of corynebacterium sp. in the present study, plg-1 gene expressing propionicin plg-1 was isolated, sequenced for the first time and the resulting sequence was analysed using several web-based bioinformatics programs. the pcr product containing plg-1 gene was transferred to different lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains using pleb590 as a cloning vector to give the modified vector plebplg-1. lab transformants showed an antimicrobial activity against esch. coli dh5alpha (most affected strain), listeria monocytogenes 18116, and salmonella enterica 25566 as model pathogenic strains. such lab transformants can be used in dairy industry to control the food-borne pathogens that are largely distributed worldwide and to feed schoolchildren in the poor countries where dangerous epidemic diseases and diarrhoea prevail.
green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by rhizopus arrhizus and cunninghamella elegans strains.
this article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by cunninghamella elegans and rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). the physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and x-ray diffraction. the effectiveness of chitosan from c. elegans and r. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). the highest production of biomass (24.60 g/l), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by r. arrhizus. chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cp and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. they both showed identical mic and mbc for all bacteria assayed. these results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.
lack of correlation between in vitro antibiosis and in vivo protection against enteropathogenic bacteria by probiotic lactobacilli.
increased resistance to infection is one of the beneficial effects attributed to  probiotic microorganisms. this effect may be due to several mechanisms: production of inhibitory substances, blocking of adhesion sites on the intestinal surface, competition for nutrients and stimulation of mucosal and systemic immunity. the present study aimed to investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of probiotic lactobacilli. the agar spot test was used to show that twenty lactobacillus strains were able to inhibit the enteropathogenic bacterium yersinia enterocolitica. this inhibition was mainly attributable to a decrease in ph resulting from dextrose fermentation by lactobacilli. the inhibition of y. enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes by two probiotic strains, lactobacillus casei c1 and lactobacillus plantarum c4, was also associated with the ph decrease. however, both strains lacked protective effects in mouse experimental infection models, with the exception of long-lasting pre-treatment with l. plantarum c4, which exerted a partial protective effect against s. typhimurium that was attributable to an immunostimulatory mechanism. our results show that in vitro antibiosis tests do not provide useful information on the probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains.
yersinia enterocolitica inhibits salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes cellular uptake.
yersinia enterocolitica biovar 1b employs two type three secretion systems (t3ss), ysa and ysc, which inject effector proteins into macrophages to prevent phagocytosis. conversely, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium uses a t3ss encoded by salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (spi1) to actively invade cells that are normally nonphagocytic and a second t3ss encoded by spi2 to survive within macrophages. given the distinctly different outcomes that occur with regard to host cell uptake of s. typhimurium and y. enterocolitica, we investigated how each pathogen influences the internalization outcome of the other. y. enterocolitica reduces s. typhimurium invasion of hela and caco-2 cells to a level similar to that observed using an s. typhimurium spi1 mutant alone. however, y. enterocolitica had no effect on s. typhimurium uptake by j774.1 or raw264.7 macrophage-like cells. y. enterocolitica was also able to inhibit the invasion of epithelial and macrophage-like cells by listeria monocytogenes. y. enterocolitica mutants lacking either the ysa or ysc t3ss were partially defective, while double mutants were completely defective, in blocking s. typhimurium uptake by epithelial cells. s. typhimurium encodes a luxr homolog, sdia, which detects n-acylhomoserine lactones (ahls) produced by y. enterocolitica and upregulates the expression of an invasin (rck) and a putative t3ss effector (srge). two different methods of constitutively activating the s. typhimurium sdia regulon failed to reverse the uptake blockade imposed by y. enterocolitica.
effects of subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials on gene acquisition events in yersinia, proteus, shigella, and salmonella recipient organisms in isolated ligated intestinal loops of swine.
objective: to assess antimicrobial resistance and transfer of virulence genes facilitated by subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials in swine intestines. animals: 20 anesthetized pigs experimentally inoculated with donor and recipient bacteria. procedures: 4 recipient pathogenic bacteria (salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, or proteus mirabilis) were incubated with donor bacteria in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of 1 of 16 antimicrobials in isolated ligated intestinal loops in swine. donor escherichia coli contained transferrable antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes. after coincubations, intestinal contents were removed and assessed for pathogens that acquired new antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes following exposure to the subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials. results: 3 antimicrobials (apramycin, lincomycin, and neomycin) enhanced transfer of an antimicrobial resistance plasmid from commensal e coli organisms to yersinia and proteus organisms, whereas 7 antimicrobials (florfenicol, hygromycin, penicillin g, roxarsone, sulfamethazine, tetracycline, and tylosin) exacerbated transfer of an integron (salmonella genomic island 1) from salmonella organisms to yersinia organisms. sulfamethazine induced the transfer of salmonella pathogenicity island 1 from pathogenic to nonpathogenic salmonella organisms. six antimicrobials (bacitracin, carbadox, erythromycin, sulfathiazole, tiamulin, and virginiamycin) did not mediate any transfer events. sulfamethazine was the only antimicrobial implicated in 2 types of transfer events. conclusions and clinical relevance: 10 of 16 antimicrobials at subinhibitory or subtherapeutic concentrations augmented specific antimicrobial resistance or transfer of virulence genes into pathogenic bacteria in isolated intestinal loops in swine. use of subtherapeutic antimicrobials in animal feed may be associated with unwanted collateral effects.
differential modulation of intracellular survival of cytosolic and vacuolar pathogens by curcumin.
curcumin, a principal component of turmeric, acts as an immunomodulator regulating the host defenses in response to a diseased condition. the role of curcumin in controlling certain infectious diseases is highly controversial. it is known to alleviate symptoms of helicobacter pylori infection and exacerbate that of leishmania infection. we have evaluated the role of curcumin in modulating the fate of various intracellular bacterial pathogens. we show that pretreatment of macrophages with curcumin attenuates the infections caused by shigella flexneri (clinical isolates) and listeria monocytogenes and aggravates those caused by salmonella enterica serovar typhi ct18 (a clinical isolate), salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica. thus, the antimicrobial nature of curcumin is not a general phenomenon. it modulated the intracellular survival of cytosolic (s. flexneri and l. monocytogenes) and vacuolar (salmonella spp., y. enterocolitica, and s. aureus) bacteria in distinct ways. through colocalization experiments, we demonstrated that curcumin prevented the active phagosomal escape of cytosolic pathogens and enhanced the active inhibition of lysosomal fusion by vacuolar pathogens. a chloroquine resistance assay confirmed that curcumin retarded the escape of the cytosolic pathogens, thus reducing their inter- and intracellular spread. we have demonstrated that the membrane-stabilizing activity of curcumin is crucial for its differential effect on the virulence of the bacteria.
combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin as-48 for inactivation of gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
enterocin as-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against gram-negative bacteria. although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at ph 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees c in an alkaline (ph 9.0) enterocin as-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. bactericidal activity against s. enterica increased greatly when enterocin as-48 was used in washing solutions in combination with several chemical compounds: edta, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. the combined treatment of enterocin as-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. the bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin as-48 was confirmed in all cases. combinations of enterocin as-48 (25 microg/ml) and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of s. enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees c and 15 degrees c. the combined treatment could therefore be applied to reduce the risks of gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
inhibition of foodborne pathogens by native microflora recovered from fresh peeled baby carrot and propagated in cultures.
the inhibitory effect of fresh peeled baby carrot and associated microflora on the viability and growth of listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, and pseudomonas marginalis was investigated. the population of viable l. monocytogenes was reduced by more than 2 logs following the dipping of sliced baby carrots in the bacterial suspension for 2 min. however, other pathogens subjected to the same treatment showed no reduction in the population. surface sanitization of baby carrots reduced the number of native microflora and in turn increased the growth of each pathogen on this commodity by 2 to 3 logs. filter-sterilized carrot homogenates exhibited no antimicrobial activity and were capable of supporting the growth of each pathogen to a density of over 2 x 10(9) cfu/ml. however, the growth of each pathogen in carrot homogenates containing microflora recovered from baby carrot and propagated in tryptic soy broth was reduced 2 to 3 logs after incubation at 28 degrees c for 2 d. on pepper disks, which have no antilisterial activity and very low levels of background microflora, the addition of carrot microflora also reduced the growth of each pathogen 2 to 4 logs after 2 d at 20 degrees c. the reduction was dependent upon the ratio between the number of carrot microflora and pathogen tested. the growth of l. monocytogenes or y. enterocolitica on pepper disks containing carrot microflora was almost completely stopped after storage at 8 degrees c for 8 d. the inhibitory effect of baby carrots on pathogens is in part due to the antimicrobial activity of carrot tissue and in part due to the antagonistic action of associated microflora.
specificity of catecholamine-induced growth in escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica.
the present study demonstrates that catecholamine responsiveness in yersinia enterocolitica, a bacterial pathogen whose infectious spectrum is principally limited to the gut, is limited to norepinephrine and dopamine, and not epinephrine; this behavior contrasts with observations for two pathogens with a wider extra-gastrointestinal spectrum, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica, which respond to all three catecholamines. epinephrine showed lower potency than norepinephrine and dopamine in inducing growth of e. coli and s. enterica, and was a potent antagonist of norepinephrine and dopamine growth responsiveness in y. enterocolitica. given that only norepinephrine and dopamine and not epinephrine-containing neurons are found with the enteric nervous system, the results suggest that certain of the more exclusive enteric pathogens may have developed response systems preferentially for those neuroendocrine hormones that are produced by the enteric nervous system as host-derived signals by which to sense the environment and initiate pathogenic processes.
behavior of yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella typhimurium in crottin goat's  cheese.
in order to evaluate the behavior of yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella typhimurium in crottin goat's cheese, inoculated products stored at 5, 15 and 25 degrees c were analysed together with chemical and microbiological characteristics of the cheese. in general, low counts of microorganisms were detected. none of the samples showed the presence of escherichia coli, salmonella spp. or y. enterocolitica. in the inoculation tests, y. enterocolitica and s. typhimurium were inhibited during storage; nevertheless, these bacteria survived for extensive periods. the counts at the end of the experiments at 5 and 15 degrees c were high, indicating that contamination with high bacterial numbers represents a potential health hazard. the primary mathematical models used to analyse the behavior of y. enterocolitica and s. typhimurium were the vitalistic, gompertz's empirical and churchill's model. the mean square error was calculated for the three models in order to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of each one. for y. enterocolitica, the vitalistic model was the best at the three temperatures. for s. typhimurium, there was no significant difference between the three models at 5 and 15 degrees c; the churchill model was clearly the best at 25 degrees c. these results confirm that, in order to predict the risk of transmission of pathogenic microorganisms in foods using mathematical models, it is essential to analyse their behavior in specific foods.
the probiotic escherichia coli strain nissle 1917 interferes with invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells by different enteroinvasive bacterial pathogens.
the probiotic escherichia coli strain nissle 1917 (mutaflor) of serotype o6:k5:h1 was reported to protect gnotobiotic piglets from infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. an important virulence property of salmonella is invasion of host epithelial cells. therefore, we tested for interference of e. coli strain nissle 1917 with salmonella invasion of int407 cells. simultaneous administration of e. coli strain nissle 1917 and salmonella resulted in up to 70% reduction of salmonella invasion efficiency. furthermore, invasion of yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, legionella pneumophila and even of listeria monocytogenes were inhibited by the probiotic e. coli strain nissle 1917 without affecting the viability of the invasive bacteria. the observed inhibition of invasion was not due to the production of microcins by the nissle 1917 strain because its isogenic microcin-negative mutant sk22d was as effective as the parent strain. reduced invasion rates were also achieved if strain nissle 1917 was separated from the invasive bacteria as well as from the int407 monolayer by a membrane non-permeable for bacteria. we conclude e. coli nissle 1917 to interfere with bacterial invasion of int407 cells via a secreted component and not relying on direct physical contact with either the invasive bacteria or the epithelial cells.
immunochemical analyses of serum antibodies from pig herds in a salmonella non-endemic region.
in a large comparative survey of danish and swedish slaughter pig herds performed prior to this work, it was unexpectedly found that some swedish herds harbored seropositive pigs. serum samples from the swedish herds had moderate responses in the salmonella mix-elisa (detecting serogroup b and c1 infections) compared to the danish herds classifying some of them as seropositive using a cut-off value at 40 od%. in sweden, extensive salmonella control is carried out by bacteriological screening of feces and lymph nodes, and the overall prevalence has been proven to be below 0.1%. the serological positive results were therefore unexpected; hence the reactivities of the swedish sera were studied by a number of immunochemical analyses (western blot, indirect elisa, inhibition elisa, avidity elisa) and compared to sera from danish pig herds with verified salmonella infections ("the reference sera"). in western blot, the swedish sera had high binding reactivities against salmonella typhimurium lps of different molecular weights, and gave binding patterns similar to that of the reference sera. pre-incubation with free s. typhimurium lps or ps (the polysaccharide part of lps) was able to inhibit the reactivity of the swedish sera in the mix-elisa. reactivities against other related bacterial lps such as citrobacter freundii lps and yersinia enterocolitica o:3 lps were observed in the swedish sera, but these lps antigens were unable to inhibit the reactivities in the mix-elisa as efficiently as s. typhimurium lps. furthermore, the swedish sera did not bind salmonella lps of another serogroup (s. meleagridis lps, serogroup e1) or rough salmonella lps, both lacking the specific o-antigenic parts of s. typhimurium lps. the avidity of the swedish sera was much lower than the avidity of the reference sera, which could indicate the presence of transient low-dose infections or stimulation by inactivated bacteria in feed. the results obtained in this investigation strongly indicate that the swedish sera contain antibodies directed against the o-antigenic part of lps from s. typhimurium or possibly on as yet unknown bacterium.
genetic characterization of the klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
a recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in klebsiella pneumoniae c3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to escherichia coli k-12. the recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coad genes, as was found in e. coli k-12. pcr amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative k. pneumoniae strains. partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. complementation analysis of known waa mutants from e. coli k-12 and/or salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the enterobacteriaceae. k. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. analysis of a constructed k. pneumoniae waae deletion mutant suggests that the waae protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-d-glc to the o-4 position of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose i, a feature shared by k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and yersinia enterocolitica.
comparison between the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. in ground beef packed by three commercially used packaging techniques.
growth of the pathogens yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7 and strains of salmonella were compared in ground beef packed in modified atmospheres of 60% co2/40% n2/0.4% co (high co2/low co mixture), 70% o2/30% co2 (high o2 mixture) and in chub packs (stuffed in plastic casings). the ground beef was inoculated with rifampicin-resistant or nalidixic acid/streptomycin-resistant strains of the pathogens (final concentration 10(2) - 10(3) bacteria/g) and stored at 4 and 10 degrees c for up to 14 days. at 4 degrees c the shelf life, based on colour stability and background flora development, was prolonged for the high co2/low co mixture compared to the two other packaging methods, but at 10 degrees c the shelf life was < 8 days for all the packaging methods. growth of y. enterocolitica was nearly totally inhibited both at 4 and 10 degrees c in the high co2/low co mixture, while the bacterial numbers in the samples packed in the high o2 mixture increased from about 5 x 10(2) bacteria/g at day 0 to about 10(4) at day 5 at 4 degrees c and to 10(5) at 10 degrees c. growth in the chub packs was even higher. l. monocytogenes showed very little growth at 4 degrees c in all treatments. at 10 degrees c there was slow growth from about 5 x 10(3) bacteria/g to about 10(4) at day 5 in the high co2/low co mixture, while the numbers in the high o2 mixture and the chub packs were about 10 times higher. growth of e. coli o157:h7 at 10 degrees c in the ground beef was nearly totally inhibited in both the high co2/low co mixture and the high o2 mixture. growth in the chub packs was higher, as the number of bacteria increased 3 log in 5 days. the salmonella strains (s. typhimurium, s. dublin, s. enteritidis and s. enterica 61:k:1,5,(7)) in the ground beef stored at 10 degrees c for 5 and 7 days grew to a higher number in the high co2/low co mixture than in the high o2 mixture. this study shows that the growth of y. enterocolitica and l. mononcytogenes in ground beef stored in the high co2 /low co mixture was not increased as a result of prolonging the shelf life. however, the observed growth of strains of salmonella at 10 degrees c in this mixture and in chub packs does emphasise the importance of temperature control during storage.
longevity of pathogenic bacteria especially salmonella in cistern water.
cistern-collected rain water which is used as process water for toilet flushing,  cleaning purposes, garden irrigation and linen washing, was experimentally contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, salmonella enteritidis, yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter jejuni. the longevity of those pathogens was investigated considering different temperatures and contents of organic materials. neither salmonella enteritidis, yersinia enterocolitica nor campylobacter jejuni are able to grow at temperatures of 5 degrees c, 15 degrees c, 20 degrees c or 37 degrees c. the most sensitive pathogen was campylobacter jejuni which showed rapidly decreasing of colony counts at 15 degrees c as compared with yersinia enterocolitica or salmonella enteritidis. for salmonella enteritidis the decrease of bacterial concentrations was higher at 37 degrees c than at 5 degrees c. increasing the concentrations of organic compounds by addition of bacteriological pepton or addition of extreme++ amounts of pidgeon feces lowers the rate of bacterial death but an increase in colony counts could not be observed at the different temperatures investigated. the elimination of salmonella is supported if the cisterns are layered with a biofilm and sediment. so it could be confirmed, that raised amounts of organic material, pidgeon feces together with optimal temperatures which can be observed accidentally in rain water cisterns can not enhance growth of enteropathogenic bacteria.
survival, physiological response and recovery of enteric bacteria exposed to a polar marine environment.
survival, sublethal injury, and recoverability of escherichia coli, enterococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica were investigated by using diffusion chambers over 54 to 56 days of in situ exposure to a polar marine environment (-1.8 degrees c; salinity, 34.5 ppt) at mcmurdo station, antarctica. plate counts were used to assess recoverability and injury, whereas direct viable counts (dvcs) and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (ctc) reduction were utilized to determine substrate responsiveness and respiratory activity, respectively. t90 values (times for 10-fold decreases in numbers of recoverable cells) on nonselective medium were ca. 216 to 259 h for e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica and 432 h for e. faecalis. sublethal injury was greater in populations of indicator bacteria than in pathogens. dvcs, ctc reduction, and plate counts indicated progressive increases in viable but nonculturable cells in e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica cultures throughout the 54-day exposure. forty-eight-day exposure of e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica resulted in decreased optimal incubation temperatures for colony formation and inability to form colonies at 37 degrees c. the detection of responsive e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica by the dvc and ctc methods remained within 1% of inoculum values during 54 days of exposure, indicating some long-term persistence in the viable-but-nonculturable state. percentages of respiring e. coli and s. typhimurium increased significantly upon addition of nutrients at all temperatures tested, indicating that nutrient availability rather than temperature limited enteric bacterial activity in this very cold environment. large nutrient inputs to low-temperature marine environments may thus allow for the long-term persistence of enteric bacteria in a nonrecoverable state.
tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors block invasin-promoted bacterial uptake by epithelial cells.
the ability to enter into (invade) mammalian cells is an essential virulence determinant of many pathogenic bacteria and intracellular parasites. these organisms are internalized by host cells upon attachment to their surface. however, the mechanisms used by intracellular parasites to induce internalization into host cells have not been defined. we found that the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocks invasion by some pathogenic bacteria, including yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis. using escherichia coli containing the cloned y. enterocolitica invasion gene inv (which codes for invasin, an integrin-binding protein), we found that staurosporine inhibits invasion by blocking bacterial internalization. two specific tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors, genistein and tyrphostin, also block the internalization but not the binding of bacteria, suggesting that bacterial uptake may be dependent on the activity of this enzyme class in host hela cells. in contrast to invasion promoted by invasin, the invasion of hela cells by salmonella typhimurium is not inhibited by any of these drugs.
