TI  == in vitro fermentation of fructooligosaccharides with human gut bacteria.
AB  == fructooligosaccharides (fos) are one of the most studied prebiotics, selectively  stimulating the growth of health-promoting bacteria in the host. however, there is increasing evidence that commensal gut bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis, clostridium butyricum, enterobacter cloacae, and even the pathogenic escherichia  coli ben2908, are also able to metabolize fos in vitro, and in some cases, fos displayed adverse effects. therefore, it is necessary to identify fos-metabolizing species that are present in the gut. unlike previous studies focusing on individual strains, this study used the traditional culture method combined with an alignment search on the gut bacteria database established from the human microbiome project (hmp). the alignment results showed that homologous  proteins for fos transporters and glycosidases were distributed in 237 of the 453 strains of gut bacteria. la506 msmk encoding the atp-binding protein and aec45 fosgh1 encoding glycoside hydrolase were most widely distributed, in 155 and 55 strains, respectively. seven of eight strains with both transporters and glycosidases were proven to be capable of metabolizing fos, while five strains without either transporters or glycosidases were not. fifteen species isolated from human feces and 11 species from the alignment search were identified to be fos-metabolizing, of which cronobacter sakazakii, marvinbryantia formatexigens, ruminococcus gnavus, and weissella paramesenteroides are reported here for the first time. thus, alignment search combined with the culture method is an effective method for obtaining a global view of the fos-metabolizing bacteria in  the gut and will be helpful in further investigating the relationship between fos and human gut bacteria.

TI  == effects of multistrain probiotics on growth performance, apparent ileal nutrient  digestibility, blood characteristics, cecal microbial shedding, and excreta odor  contents in broilers.
AB  == this experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, and clostridium butyricum supplementation in broilers. a total of 400 one-day-old mixed sex ross 308 broilers with an initial  average bw of 46 +/- 0.5 g were randomly allotted into 4 treatments with 5 replicate pens per treatment and 20 broilers in each pen for 35 d. dietary treatments were (1) an antibiotic-free diet (con), (2) con + 5 mg/kg of avilamycin, (3) con + 1 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (p1), and (4) con + 2 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (p2). broilers fed the p1 and p2 diets had greater bw gain than broilers fed the con diet during d 22 to 35 (p = 0.01) and overall (p = 0.02). feed conversion ratios in p1 and p2 were decreased (p = 0.03) compared with that in con from d 22 to 35. ileal digestibility of most essential amino acids, with the exception of his and phe, were increased (p < 0.05) in p1 and p2 compared with con. serum iga and igm concentrations in p2 were higher (p < 0.05) than those in con. the cecal lactobacillus numbers were increased (p = 0.02), and the counts of escherichia coli were decreased (p = 0.03) in p1 and p2 compared with con. dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics decreased (p < 0.05) the excreta nh3  content compared with the con. in conclusion, dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics improved broiler growth performance, ileal amino acids digestibility, and humoral immunity. furthermore, the probiotics decreased the cecal numbers of e. coli and decreased the nh3 content of excreta.

TI  == effects of clostridium butyricum on growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with escherichia coli k88.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of clostridium butyricumon growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with escherichia coli k88. three hundred sixty 1-d-old broiler chickens were randomly divided into 4 treatments: negative control (nc) birds were fed a basal diet and not challenged with e. coli k88; positive control (pc)  birds were fed a basal diet and challenged with e. coli k88; c. butyricum treatment (cb) birds were fed a diet containing 2 x 10(7) cfu c. butyricum/kg of  diet and challenged with e. coli k88; and colistin sulfate treatment (cs) birds were fed a diet containing 20 mg of colistin sulfate/kg of diet and challenged with e. coli k88. birds fed cb had greater (p < 0.05) bw than the pc birds from 3 to 21 d postchallenge. birds fed cb had greater (p < 0.05) serum iga and igy at 14 d postchallenge, greater (p < 0.05) serum igm at 21 d postchallenge, and greater (p < 0.05) mucosal secreted iga at 3 and 7 d postchallenge than the pc birds. birds fed cb had greater concentrations of serum complement component 3 at 14 d postchallenge, and greater (p < 0.05) concentrations of serum complement component 4 at 3, 7, and 14 d postchallenge than the pc birds. birds in the cs or cb treatments had less cecal e. coli population at 3, 7, and 21 d postchallenge,  and less cecal clostridium perfringens counts at 21 d postchallenge compared with the pc birds. the cb treatment increased (p < 0.05) the population of cecal lactobacillus at 3 d postchallenge and the number of cecal bifidobacterium at 3,  14, and 21 d postchallenge in comparison with the pc treatment. the results indicate that dietary supplementation of cb promotes growth performance, improves immune function, and benefits the cecal microflora in escherichia coli k88-challenged chickens.

TI  == growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == background: the growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria  were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. method: a microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate  the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the test materials against the organisms. results: delta-3-carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of gram-positive bacteria (clostridium difficile atcc 9689, clostridium paraputrificum atcc 25780, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 11775 and bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), 0.18-0.70 mg/ml) except for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 13311 (mic, 2.94 mg/ml). the mic of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/ml against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against c. difficile (0.70 mg/ml); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/ml) and 4 (5.80 mg/ml) against c. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/ml), 4 (12.0 mg/ml), and 7 (0.70 mg/ml) against c. perfringens); compound 1 against e. coli (7.20 mg/ml) and s. enterica serovar typhimurium (12.0 mg/ml). overall, all of the constituents were  less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (mic, 0.063-0.25 mg/ ml). the lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium clostridium butyricum atcc 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (b. fragilis and e. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. beneficial gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria was not observed. scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. conclusion: a. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == short communication: jenny milk as an inhibitor of late blowing in cheese: a preliminary report.
AB  == late blowing on semihard and hard cheese may have an important economic effect on dairy production. many studies have attempted to prevent this defect by physical  treatment, the use of additives, and the use of bacteriocins. in this paper, we look at the effect of jenny milk as an inhibitor of blowing caused by clostridia  and coliforms in ewe cheese making. bulk ewe and jenny milk samples were collected in the morning by mechanical milking and were refrigerated at 4 degrees c. on the collected samples, the count of somatic cells, coliforms, clostridium butyricum, and escherichia coli were determined. the bulk raw milk was divided in two 45-l vats: vat 1 was used as a control, whereas 0.5l of jenny milk was added  to vat 2. four semihard cheeses, weighing about 2 kg each, were made from each vat. cheese making was replicated twice. after a ripening period of 60 d, the count of coliforms and of c. butyricum was determined. in the treated group, a significant inhibition of coliform bacteria was observed. the addition of jenny milk in cheese making may prove to be a useful and innovative approach for the inhibition of spore-forming clostridia strains.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == effects of probiotic, clostridium butyricum, on growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens.
AB  == four hundred and fifty 1-d-old male lingnan yellow broiler chickens were used to  investigate the effects of clostridium butyricum on growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora. the birds were randomly assigned to 5 treatments  and offered the same antibiotic-free basal diets for 42 d. the treatments were as follows: no addition (control), 1 x 10(7) cfu c. butyricum/kg of diet (cb1), 2 x  10(7) cfu c. butyricum/kg of diet (cb2), 3 x 10(7) cfu c. butyricum/kg of diet (cb3), and 10 mg of colistine sulfate/kg of diet (antibiotic). birds fed either cb2 or antibiotic had greater overall bw than those in the control group. during  d 1 to 7, d 21 to 42, and d 1 to 42, birds fed either cb2 or cb3 or the antibiotic diet had greater adg compared with those in the control group. no significant differences were observed in bw or adg among the cb2, cb3, and antibiotic groups. birds fed the cb2 or cb3 diet had greater concentrations of iga and igg in the serum from d 14 to 42 and greater igm in the serum from d 21 to 42 than those in the control group. birds fed the cb3 diet had a greater concentration of complement component 3 in the serum than those in the control group from d 7 to 42. dietary c. butyricum decreased (p < 0.05) escherichia coli  in cecal contents on d 14 and 42, and both cb2 and cb3 decreased (p < 0.05) cecal salmonella and clostridium perfringen from d 14 to 42 compared with the control.  broilers fed either cb2 or cb3 had greater cecal lactobacillus and bifidobacterium counts from d 21 to 42, and birds fed c. butyricum had greater cecal c. butyricum counts during the whole period compared with those in the control group. the results indicate that c. butyricum promotes growth performance and immune function and benefits the balance of the intestinal microflora in broiler chickens.

TI  == 1,3-propanediol production by escherichia coli expressing genes of dha operon from clostridium butyricum 2cr371.5.
AB  == 1,3-propanediol is used as a monomer in the production of some polymers e.g. polytrimethylene terephthalate used in the production of carpets and textile fibers and in the thermoplastics engineering. however, the traditional chemical synthesis is expensive, generates some toxic intermediates and requires a reduction step under high hydrogen pressure. biological production of 1,3-propanediol could be an attractive alternative to the traditional chemical methods. moreover, crude glycerol which is a by-product of biodiesel production,  can be used. we constructed a recombinant escherichia coli strain producing 1,3-propanediol from glycerol by introducing genes of the dha operon from clostridium butyricum 2cr371.5, a strain from our collection of environmental samples and strains. the e. coli strain produced 3.7 g of 1,3-propanediol per one litre of culture with the yield of 0.3 g per 1 g of glycerol consumed.

TI  == ability of clostridium butyricum to inhibit escherichia coli-induced apoptosis in chicken embryo intestinal cells.
AB  == the beneficial effects of clostridium butyricum in the treatment of intestinal inflammatory disorders are well known. however, it is not fully understood how such bacteria inhibit pathogen-induced intestinal diseases. for this purpose, we  investigated the effects of c. butyricum and its spent culture supernatants (scs) on escherichia coli (ehec) growth and adherence to chicken embryo intestinal cells (ceics). we also evaluated the potential of c. butyricum to inhibit ehec-induced apoptosis in ceics. c. butyricum and its scs exhibited significant inhibitory activity on ehec growth and adherence to ceics. c. butyricum also showed a significant inhibitory effect on ehec-induced apoptosis by modulating the expression of xiap (x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein), bclxl (b-cell lymphoma-extra large), fas, bcl2 (b-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2), bax (bcl-2-associated x protein), p53 (tumor protein 53) and via inhibition of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. these results together indicate that c. butyricum possesses the ability to prevent ehec-induced intestinal disorders both directly, through inhibiting ehec viability, and indirectly, via medicating ehec-induced apoptosis. these observations may help explain the beneficial properties of c. butyricum. furthermore, our data is novel in the case of poultry and the manner in which c. butyricum prevents the ehec-induced apoptosis provides supportive information for the treatment of colibacillosis in poultry.

TI  == [engineering of escherichia coli for convenient expression of [fefe]-hydrogenase].
AB  == objective: a new method used to heterologously express [fefe]-hydrogenase in escherichia coli was investigated in our present study. methods: by homologous recombination, three assistant genes (hyde, hydf and hydg) for hydrogenase were integrated into the chromosome of e. coli bw 25113-10, in which all hydrogenase genes were inactivated. a hydrogenase structural gene hyda from clostridium butyricum was used to test the hydrogenase maturation ability of the recombined e. coli. bw 25113-13. results: the corrected integration of the three assistant genes was confirmed by pcr, and rt-pcr results indicated that the three accessory genes were transcripted in the recombinant. the active expression of hyda indicated that the constitutively expressed accessory proteins could assist the maturation of the [fefe]-hydrogenases. conclusions: a simplified [fefe]-hydrogenase expression recombinant e. coli bw25113-13 was constructed. it  would lay foundations for the functional screening of [fefe]-hydrogenases and the construction of novel hydrogen producing pathways in e. coli.

TI  == [the new microbiological hazards in food].
AB  == this paper describes the new microbiological hazards in food. for protecting human health, nowadays food safety authorities face with many challenges, that years ago were largely unheard. in 2011 verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4 has been isolated in germany. strain came from fenugreek sprouts originated from egypt. it was characterized by unique features such as presence of enteroaggregative escherichia coli genes (aata, aggr, aap, agga, aggc) and resistance to most antibiotics. in poland only three cases of disease caused by o104:h4 strain have been reported. another emergence pathogen in poland is yersinia enterocolitica 08, biotype 1b. it is the most pathogenic bioserotype recently isolated in the usa only. food-borne is commonly associated with raw or  undercooked pork. the source of yersinia spp. may be also milk and water. the presence ofbotulinum neurotoxins in food is not new, but still an important issue because of their high toxicity to human. botulinum neurotoxins are high-molecular thermolabile proteins produced by clostridium botulinum and some strains of clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii. based on their antigenic properties, botulin neurotoxins are divided into seven types a-g, however only types a, b, e and f are toxic to humans and some animals. increasing risk associated with food results from antimicrobial resistance eg. extended spectrum  beta-lactamases (esbls) producing bacteria, particularly enterobacteriaceae. until recently strains esbl+ were isolated in hospitals, however during last years they have been isolated from healthy humans, animals and food of animal origin. increasingly common microbiological hazard in food is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). although prevalence of this pathogen in food is not high, the thread comes from difficulties of treating of infections caused by mrsa. the occurrence of food-borne in humans may also be associated with presence of viruses in food and water. the carrier of viruses may be equipment in food plant, production line, packaging and man. most food-borne are caused by noroviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis a virus and hepatitis e virus.  an increased number of food-borne viral outbreaks are recorded in several countries. reasons for this include the improved diagnostic methods that have enhanced detection of some virus groups, and the increased marketing of fresh and frozen foods that has led to a worldwide availability of high risk food. viruses  may contaminate food either through contamination at source, principally through  sewage pollution of the environment, or in association with food

TI  == genetic manipulation of butyrate formation pathways in clostridium butyricum.
AB  == clostridium butyricum is one of the commonly used species for fermentative hydrogen production. while producing h(2), it can produce acids (lactic, acetic and butyric acids) and co(2), as well as a small amount of ethanol. it has been proposed that elimination of competing pathways, such as the butyrate formation pathway, should increase h(2) yields in clostridium species. however, the application of this strategy has been hindered by the unavailability of genetic tools for these organisms. in this study, we successfully transferred a plasmid (pmtl007) to c. butyricum by inter-specific conjugation with escherichia coli and disrupted hbd, the gene encoding beta-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase in c. butyricum. fermentation data showed that inactivation of hbd in c. butyricum eliminated the butyrate formation pathway, resulting in a significant increase in ethanol production and an obvious decrease in h(2) yield compared with the wild type strain. however, under low partial pressure of h(2), the hbd-deficient strain showed increased h(2) production with the simultaneous decrease of ethanol production, indicating that h(2) production by c. butyricum may compete for nadh  with the ethanol formation pathway. together with the discovery of a potential bifurcating hydrogenase, this study extends our understanding of the mechanism of h(2) production by c. butyricum.

TI  == molecular characterization of the glycerol-oxidative pathway of clostridium butyricum vpi 1718.
AB  == the glycerol oxidative pathway of clostridium butyricum vpi 1718 plays an important role in glycerol dissimilation. we isolated, sequenced, and characterized the region coding for the glycerol oxidation pathway. five open reading frames (orfs) were identified: dhar, encoding a putative transcriptional  regulator; dhad (1,142 bp), encoding a glycerol dehydrogenase; and dhak (995 bp), dhal (629 bp), and dham (386 bp), encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate (pep)-dependent  dihydroxyacetone (dha) kinase enzyme complex. northern blot analysis demonstrated that the last four genes are transcribed as a 3.2-kb polycistronic operon only in glycerol-metabolizing cultures, indicating that the expression of this operon is  regulated at the transcriptional level. the transcriptional start site of the operon was determined by primer extension, and the promoter region was deduced. the glycerol dehydrogenase activity of dhad and the pep-dependent dha kinase activity of dhaklm were demonstrated by heterologous expression in different escherichia coli mutants. based on our complementation experiments, we proposed that the hpr phosphoryl carrier protein and his9 residue of the dham subunit are  involved in the phosphoryl transfer to dihydroxyacetone-phosphate. dhar, a potential regulator of this operon, was found to contain conserved transmitter and receiver domains that are characteristic of two-component systems present in  the arac family. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular characterization of a glycerol oxidation pathway in a gram-positive bacterium.

TI  == comparative study of biological hydrogen production by pure strains and consortia of facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == in this paper, a simple and rapid method was developed in order to assess in comparative tests the production of binary biogas mixtures containing co(2) and another gaseous compound such as hydrogen or methane. this method was validated and experimented for the characterisation of the biochemical hydrogen potential of different pure strains and mixed cultures of hydrogen-producing bacteria (hpb) growing on glucose. the experimental results compared the hydrogen production yield of 19 different pure strains and sludges: facultative and strict anaerobic  hpb strains along with anaerobic digester sludges thermally pre-treated or not. significant yields variations were recorded even between different strains of the same species by i.e. about 20% for three clostridium butyricum strains. the pure  clostridium butyricum and pasteurianum strains achieved the highest yields i.e. up to 1.36 mol h(2)/mol glucose compared to the yields achieved by the sludges and the tested escherichia and citrobacter strains.

TI  == [effects of probiotics on intestinal bacterial colonization in premature infants].
AB  == objective: to study the possible roles of probiotics in decreasing intestinal bacterial colonization rate and the incidence of enterogenic infections in premature infants. methods: seventy premature infants were randomly assigned to two groups: probiotics and conventional treatment groups (control) (n=35 each). the probiotics treatment group was administered with oral clostridium butyricum powder (250 mg, twice daily up to discharge) 24 hrs after birth except conventional treatment. rectal swab cultures were done at admission, 5 and 12 days after admission, and before discharge. clinical and laboratory findings were compared between the two groups. results: the intestinal bacterial colonization rate in the probiotics treatment group was lower than that in the control group 12 days after admission (60% vs 83%; p<0.05) and before discharge (51% vs 80%; p<0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecium were common colonization bacteria in the two groups. diarrhea occurred in 7 cases (20%) in the probiotics treatment group compared with 16 cases (46%) in the control group (p<0.05). two infants (6%) developed sepsis in the probiotics treatment group compared with 9 cases (26%) in the control group (p<0.05). conclusions: probiotics can decrease intestinal bacterial colonization rate and the incidence of diarrhea and sepsis in premature infants.

TI  == selected microbial groups and short-chain fatty acids profile in a simulated chicken cecum supplemented with two strains of lactobacillus.
AB  == among the bacterial fermentation end products in the chicken cecum, butyrate is of particular importance because of its nutritional properties for the epithelial cell and pathogen inhibitory effects in the gut. an in vitro experiment, operated with batch bioreactor, was conducted to quantify butyric-producing bacteria in a  simulated broiler cecum supplemented with lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salicinius jcm 1230 and lactobacillus agilis jcm 1048 during 24 h of incubation.  selected bacterial species were determined by real-time pcr and short-chain fatty acids and lactate concentrations were monitored. the results showed that after 24 h of incubation, lactobacillus supplementation significantly increased the number of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and faecalibacterium prausnitzii in medium containing cecal content and lactobacilli supplementation (cc + l) compared with  the control (cc). addition of lactobacilli did not alter escherichia coli and clostridium butyricum, whereas it significantly (p < 0.05) reduced salmonella in  treatment cc + l compared with the cc treatment. propionate and butyrate formation were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in treatment cc + l as compared with the cc treatment. lactate was only detected in treatment containing 2 lactobacillus strains. after 24 h of incubation, acetate concentration significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in all treatments. it was suggested that lactate produced by lactobacillus in the cecal content improved the growth of butyric producers such as f. prausnitzii, which significantly increased butyrate  accumulation. additionally, the results showed that butyrate and propionate inhibited salmonella without influencing the e. coli profile.

TI  == human intestinal microbiota: characterization of a simplified and stable gnotobiotic rat model.
AB  == the study of host microbe interactions is hampered by the complexity and inter-individual variability of the human gut microbiota. therefore, a simplified human intestinal microbiota (sihumi) consisting of seven bacterial species was introduced into germfree rats. species selection was based on numerical importance and fermentative abilities in the human gut. association of the rats with the sihumi (anaerostipes caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bifidobacterium longum, blautia producta, clostridium ramosum, escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum) resulted in increased faecal concentrations of short chain fatty acids compared to germfree animals. since the faecal butyrate concentration was low (0.9 +/- 0.5 micromol/g dry matter) the sihumi was complemented with clostridium butyricum. this extended bacterial community (sihumix) led to an increased faecal butyrate concentration of 1.5 +/- 0.7 micromol/g dry matter. besides forming scfa, the sihumix was capable of degrading mucins, beta-aspartylglycine and bilirubin. these features are characteristic of  conventional animals but not observed in germfree animals. dietary interventions  with modifications in fibre and fat content led to changes in the proportion of community members. the relative increase of one member of this community in response to a high-fat diet reflects the situation reported for obese mice and human subjects. the strength of the model communities is their remarkable stability over time and their easy transfer to the offspring.

TI  == sequence analysis of a bacteriocinogenic plasmid of clostridium butyricum and expression of the bacteriocin gene in escherichia coli.
AB  == a small cryptic plasmid, namely, pcbm588, was obtained from clostridium butyricum miyairi 588 (cbm588)--a bacterium used in probiotics. the complete sequence of pcbm588 was determined. the size of pcbm588 was 8060 bp and the g + c content was 24.3%. nine open reading frames (orfs) were predicted, and orf3 showed significant homologies with a structural bacteriocin gene of clostridium tyrobutyricum. the putative bacteriocin gene was inserted into the pet21d expression vector in frame; it was expressed as a his-tagged recombinant protein  in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). a total of 10240au of the recombinant bacteriocin were purified from 100 ml of e. coli culture. the bacteriocin was cleaved into 2  portions, and the small c-terminal polypeptide consisting of 83 amino acids possessed bactericidal activity. these results demonstrated that the orf3 of pcbm588 encoded a bacteriocin, which is identical or very similar to the previously reported butyricin 7423.

TI  == functions of the clostridium acetobutylicium fabf and fabz proteins in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis.
AB  == background: the original anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway proposed by goldfine and bloch was based on in vivo labeling studies in clostridium butyricum atcc 6015 (now c. beijerinckii) but to date no dedicated unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme has been identified in clostridia. c.  acetobutylicium synthesizes the same species of unsaturated fatty acids as e. coli, but lacks all of the known unsaturated fatty acid synthetic genes identified in e. coli and other bacteria. a possible explanation was that two enzymes of saturated fatty acid synthesis of c. acetobutylicium, fabz and fabf might also function in the unsaturated arm of the pathway (a fabz homologue is known to be an unsaturated fatty acid synthetic enzyme in enterococci). results:  we report that the fabf homologue located within the fatty acid biosynthetic gene cluster of c. acetobutylicium functions in synthesis of both unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. expression of this protein in e. coli functionally replaced both the fabb and fabf proteins of the host in vivo and replaced e. coli fabb in a defined in vitro fatty acid synthesis system. in contrast the single c. acetobutylicium fabz homologue, although able to functionally replace e. coli fabz in vivo and in vitro, was unable to replace faba, the key dehydratase-isomerase of e. coli unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo and lacked isomerase activity in vitro. conclusion: thus, c. acetobutylicium introduces the double of unsaturated fatty acids by use of a novel and unknown enzyme.

TI  == microbial conversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol by an engineered strain of escherichia coli.
AB  == in an effort to improve industrial production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), we engineered a novel polycistronic operon under the control of the temperature-sensitive lambda phage p(l)p(r) promoter regulated by the cits857 repressor and expressed it in escherichia coli k-12 er2925. the genes for the production of 1,3-pd in clostridium butyricum, dhab1 and dhab2, which encode the  vitamin b(12)-independent glycerol dehydratase dhab1 and its activating factor, dhab2, respectively, were tandemly arrayed with the e. coli yqhd gene, which encodes the 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase isoenzyme yqhd, an nadp-dependent dehydrogenase that can directly convert glycerol to 1,3-pd. the microbial conversion of 1,3-pd from glycerol by this recombinant e. coli strain was studied in a two-stage fermentation process. during the first stage, a novel high-cell-density fermentation step, there was significant cell growth and the majority of the metabolites produced were organic acids, mainly acetate. during the second stage, glycerol from the fresh medium was rapidly converted to 1,3-pd  following a temperature shift from 30 degrees c to 42 degrees c. the by-products  were mainly pyruvate and acetate. during this two-stage process, the overall 1,3-pd yield and productivity reached 104.4 g/liter and 2.61 g/liter/h, respectively, and the conversion rate of glycerol to 1,3-pd reached 90.2% (g/g).  to our knowledge, this is the highest reported yield and productivity efficiency  of 1,3-pd with glycerol as the sole source of carbon. furthermore, the overall fermentation time was only 40 h, shorter than that of any other reports.

TI  == the relationship between instability of h2 production and compositions of bacterial communities within a dark fermentation fluidized-bed bioreactor.
AB  == microbial community composition dynamics was studied during h(2) fermentation from glucose in a fluidized-bed bioreactor (fbr) aiming at obtaining insight into the h(2) fermentation microbiology and factors resulting in the instability of biofilm processes. fbr h(2) production performance was characterised by an instable pattern of prompt onset of h(2) production followed by rapid decrease. gradual enrichment of organisms increased the diversity of fbr attached and suspended-growth phase bacterial communities during the operation. fbr bacteria included potential h(2) producers, h(2) consumers and neither h(2) producers nor  consumers, and those distantly related to any known organisms. the prompt onset of h(2) production was due to rapid growth of clostridium butyricum (99-100%) affiliated strains after starting continuous feed. the proportion trend of c. butyricum in fbr attached and suspended-growth phase communities coincided with h(2) and butyrate production. high glucose loading rate favoured the h(2) production by escherichia coli (100%) affiliated strain. decrease in h(2) production, associated with a shift from acetate-butyrate to acetate-propionate production, was due to changes in fbr attached and suspended-growth phase bacterial community compositions. during the shift, organisms, including potential propionate producers, were enriched in the communities while the proportion trend of c. butyricum decreased. we suggest that the instability of h(2) fermentation in biofilm reactors is due to enrichment and efficient adhesion of h(2) consumers on the carrier and, therefore, biofilm reactors may not favour  mesophilic h(2) fermentation.

TI  == effect of clostridium butyricum on fecal flora in helicobacter pylori eradication therapy.
AB  == aim: to investigate the effect of probiotic bacterium, clostridium butyricum miyairi 588 strain (cbm) on the changes of the fecal flora in helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) treatment. methods: thirty-five patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers positive for h. pylori were randomized either to 1 wk amoxicillin, clarithromycin, lansoprazole (group 1) or to the same regimen supplemented with cbm 7 d ahead of the triple therapy (group 2). stool samples were collected before and 2, 4, 7, 15, and 22 d after the starting eradication therapy, and were examined intestinal flora. patients were required to keep a diary record of their condition. results: obligate anaerobes decreased significantly on d 2, 4, 8 and 15 in group 1. on the other hand, they did not decrease significantly in group 2. the escherichia coli was dominant bacterium in enterobacteriaceae, but that was replaced by other species such as klebsiella and enterobacter after eradication in group 1. the change was suppressed in group 2. abdominal symptoms were less frequent in group 2 than in group 1. conclusion: the combined use of cbm reduced  the changes in the intestinal flora and decreased the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.

TI  == metabolic engineering of clostridium acetobutylicum for the industrial production of 1,3-propanediol from glycerol.
AB  == clostridium butyricum is to our knowledge the best natural 1,3-propanediol producer from glycerol and the only microorganism identified so far to use a coenzyme b12-independent glycerol dehydratase. however, to develop an economical  process of 1,3-propanediol production, it would be necessary to improve the strain by a metabolic engineering approach. unfortunately, no genetic tools are currently available for c. butyricum and all our efforts to develop them have been so far unsuccessful. to obtain a better "vitamin b12-free" biological process, we developed a metabolic engineering strategy with clostridium acetobutylicum. the 1,3-propanediol pathway from c. butyricum was introduced on a plasmid in several mutants of c. acetobutylicum altered in product formation. the dg1(pspd5) recombinant strain was the most efficient strain and was further characterized from a physiological and biotechnological point of view. chemostat  cultures of this strain grown on glucose alone produced only acids (acetate, butyrate and lactate) and a high level of hydrogen. in contrast, when glycerol was metabolized in chemostat culture, 1,3-propanediol became the major product, the specific rate of acid formation decreased and a very low level of hydrogen was observed. in a fed-batch culture, the dg1(pspd5) strain was able to produce 1,3-propanediol at a higher concentration (1104 mm) and productivity than the natural producer c. butyricum vpi 3266. furthermore, this strain was also successfully used for very long term continuous production of 1,3-propanediol at  high volumetric productivity (3 g l-1 h-1) and titer (788 mm).

TI  == the effect of probiotic treatment with clostridium butyricum on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 infection in mice.
AB  == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h7 has been considered as an agent responsible for outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. we examined the effect of the probiotic agent clostridium butyricum miyairi strain 588 on ehec o157:h7 infections in vitro and in vivo using gnotobiotic mice. the growth of ehec o157:h7 and the production of shiga-like toxins in broth cultures were inhibited by co-incubation with c. butyricum. the antibacterial effects of butyric and lactic acid were demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner. in addition, the inhibitory effect of butyric acid on the  viability of ehec was demonstrated not only at low ph, but also at neutral ph adjusted to 7.0. flowcytometric analysis showed that pre-incubation of caco-2 cells with c. butyricum and e. coli k12 inhibited the adhesion of ehec o157:h7. however, the effect of c. butyricum on adhesion of ehec to caco-2 cells was more  inhibitory than that of e. coli k12. gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with ehec o157:h7 died within 4-7 days after the infection. on the other hand, all gnotobiotic mice prophylactically pre-treated with c. butyricum survived exposure to ehec o157:h7 and of the gnotobiotic mice therapeutically post-treated with c.  butyricum, 50% survived. both counts of ehec o157:h7 and the amounts of shiga-like toxins (stx1 and stx2) in fecal contents of gnotobiotic mice di-associated with ehec o157:h7 and c. butyricum were less than those of gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with ehec o157:h7. these results indicated that  the probiotic bacterium c. butyricum miyairi strain 588 has preventive and therapeutic effects on ehec o157:h7 infection in gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == molecular characterization of the 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd) operon of clostridium  butyricum.
AB  == the genes encoding the 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd) operon of clostridium butyricum vpi1718 were characterized from a molecular and a biochemical point of view. this operon is composed of three genes, dhab1, dhab2, and dhat. when grown in a vitamin b12-free mineral medium with glycerol as carbon source, escherichia coli  expressing dhab1, dhab2, and dhat produces 1,3-pd and high glycerol dehydratase and 1,3-pd dehydrogenase activities. dhab1 and dhab2 encode, respectively, a new  type of glycerol dehydratase and its activator protein. the deduced proteins dhab1 and dhab2, with calculated molecular masses of 88,074 and 34,149 da, respectively, showed no homology with the known glycerol dehydratases that are all b12 dependent but significant similarity with the pyruvate formate lyases and pyruvate formate lyases activating enzymes and their homologues. the 1,158-bp dhat gene codes for a 1,3-pd dehydrogenase with a calculated molecular mass of 41,558 da, revealing a high level of identity with other dhat proteins from natural 1,3-pd producers. the expression of the 1,3-pd operon in c. butyricum is  regulated at the transcriptional level, and this regulation seems to involve a two-component signal transduction system dhaasdhaa, which may have a similar function to dhar, a transcriptional regulator found in other natural 1,3-pd producers. the discovery of a glycerol dehydratase, coenzyme b12 independent, should significantly influence the development of an economical vitamin b12-free  biological process for the production of 1,3-pd from renewable resources.

TI  == [evaluation of the bacterial flora in natural corn silage].
AB  == silage is the best method for forage conservation, keeping it in a fresh condition and with high nutrient content. in order to study the natural evolution of maize silage without additives during 50 days after sealed, ph, temperature changes, number and type of the indigenous bacteria were studied every 5 days. the initial ph decreased from 6.40 to 4.10 and temperature stabilized at 26 degrees c. the mesophilic aerobic bacteria were quickly reduced across time. enterococci were descended gradually. clostridia remained in a low quantity. the  microorganisms most frequently isolated were escherichia coli, clostridium butyricum, enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum; this acid lactic bacteria was the principal cause of the abundant production of anaerobic fermentation of sugars in the forage reaching the ph which maintained the silage  in adequate conditions.

TI  == a novel mechanism controls anaerobic and catabolite regulation of the escherichia coli tdc operon.
AB  == the tdc operon is subject to crp-controlled catabolite repression. expression of  the operon is also induced anaerobically, although this regulation does not rely  on direct control by either fnr or arca. recently, the anaerobic expression of the tdc operon was found to be fortuitously induced in the presence of glucose by a heterologous gene isolated from the gram-positive anaerobe clostridium butyricum. the gene, termed tcbc, encoded a histone-like protein of 14.5 kda. using tdc-lacz fusions, it was shown that tcbc did not activate tdc expression by functionally replacing any of the operon regulators. in vitro transcription analyses with rna polymerase and crp revealed that faithful crp-dependent transcription initiation occurred only on supercoiled templates. no specific, crp-dependent transcription initiation was observed on relaxed or linear dna templates. surprisingly, purified his-tagged tcbc activated transcription from a  relaxed, circular template, but not from supercoiled or linear templates. examination of the crp binding site of the tdc promoter revealed that it was located 43.5 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. repositioning of the crp site at -41.5 bp abolished activation by the tcbc protein and allowed crp-dependent transcription to occur on linear, relaxed and supercoiled templates. tcbc bound dna non-specifically; however, in topoisomerase i relaxation assays, it was demonstrated that tcbc imposed torsional constraints on negatively supercoiled dna, which influenced the ability of the enzyme to relax the topoisomers. taken together, these results strongly suggest that tcbc activates transcription of tdc by altering the local topological status of the tdc promoter and that, in the wild-type tdc promoter, the crp binding site is misaligned to allow transcription to occur only under optimal conditions. indeed, in vivo transcription analyses revealed that repositioning of the crp binding site to -41.5 bp resulted in high-level, crp-dependent transcription, even under  catabolite-repressing conditions, and that transcription was no longer influenced by tcbc. remarkably, however, anaerobic regulation of the mutant promoter was retained. this indicates that the other tdc regulators, tdca and tdcr, govern anaerobic transcription activation by crp.

TI  == gene transfer to clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319.
AB  == although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process  of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. to remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319. firstly, transfer of tn1545 has been obtained using an enterococcus faecalis donor. secondly, incp-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. the yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic c. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. a restriction endonuclease was detected  in crude extracts of c. cellulolyticum. this enzyme, named cce:i, is an isoschizomer of msp:i (hpa:ii). electro-transformation was employed to establish  plasmids containing the replication functions of pamss1 (en. faecalis), pim13 (bacillus subtilis), pcb102 (clostridium butyricum), pip404 (clostridium perfringens) and pwv01 (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in c. cellulolyticum. transformants were only obtained if the dna was appropriately methylated on the external c of the sequence 5'-ccgg-3' using either bsu:fi methylase in vivo or msp:i methylase in vitro. plasmids based on the pamss1 and pim13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pcb102 replicon. selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg dna) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg dna). the methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.

TI  == in vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  == it has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to  utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. the six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules a (amylose; sigma) and b (culture pro 958n). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. it was demonstrated that bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium spp., and strains of eubacterium, clostridium, streptococcus, and propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only bifidobacterium spp. and clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. in fact, c. butyricum and bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on bifidobacterium and bacteroides cells and were extracellular for c. butyricum. active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on sds-page gels showed that the bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (m(r)) weights (>160,000),  medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). it was concluded that bifidobacterium spp. and c. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.

TI  == effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm: an experimental study.
AB  == effects of intestinal microflora on the development of colonic neoplasm induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) were observed using conventionalized and gnotobiotic mouse models. the incidence of colonic adenoma in germ-free mice (iqi/jic) (gf), mice conventionalized after dmh injection (cvz-post-dmh) and conventionalized mice (cvz, conventionalized before dmh injection) was 74%, 69% and 58%, respectively. the mean number of adenomas per mouse in the three groups  was 2.6, 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. however, the adenoma in cvz was larger than in gf. the incidence of adenoma in mice mono-associated with mitsuokella multiacida, clostridium butyricum, bifidobacterium longum, clostridium paraputrificum, escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus was 68%, 68%, 63%, 50%, 50% and 30%, respectively. however, the adenoma in the cl. paraputrificum group and the cl. butyricum group was larger than in gf. faecal ph in cvz and the l. acidophilus group was significantly lower than in gf. the deconjugation rate of faecal bile acids in cvz, the cl. paraputrificum group and the cl. butyricum group was significantly higher than in gf. these findings suggested two different effects of microflora on the development of dmh-induced adenoma: either an inhibition of the incidence of adenoma or a promotion of tumour growth. effects of l. acidophilus may be mediated by faecal ph and effects of cl. paraputrificum  and cl. butyricum by deconjugated bile acids.

TI  == does probiotics administration decrease serum endotoxin levels in infants?
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to examine whether administration of probiotics to infants can change the ratio of intestinal flora and thereby decrease serum endotoxin produced by potentially pathogenic microorganisms. methods: nine infants including five with of biliary atresia, two with omphalocele, one each with hirschsprung's disease and imperforate anus were studied. all patients were stable, and no antibiotics were given during this study. a probiotic mixture consisting of streptococcus faecalis, clostridium butyricum and bacillus mesentericus was administered orally to each infant at 2 g/day for 2 weeks. fecal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, serum endotoxin level, and other biochemical parameters were examined. results: in fecal cultures, anaerobic bacteria including bifidobacterium increased significantly whereas escherichia coli, streptococcus, and klebsiella tended to decrease. the ratio of anaerobic to aerobic bacteria increased five times as a result of administration of probiotics, and serum endotoxin levels decreased. conclusions: probiotics affect intestinal bacterial flora by increasing anaerobic bacteria and decreasing the population of potentially pathogenic microorganisms.  a decrease in luminal endotoxin may result in less endotoxin translocation or bacterial translocation.

TI  == ecological and physiological studies on large intestinal bacteria in relation to  production of hydrolytic and reductive enzymes involved in formation of genotoxic metabolites.

AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == molecular analysis of the malr gene of clostridium butyricum ncimb 7423, a member of the laci-galr family of repressor proteins.
AB  == deletion of a region of dna 5' to a previously characterised malq gene of clostridium butyricum resulted in increased production of the enzyme activity encoded by malq, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 335 amino acids. this protein was found to share 33% amino acid sequence identity with the bacillus subtilis ccpa (catabolite control protein) repressor, 28% identity with the streptomyces coelicolor malr repressor, and 30%, 25%, and 21% amino acid identity with the escherichia coli repressors galr, laci and mali, respectively. the amino-terminal domain was predicted to be able to form a helix-turn-helix structure, and shared highest similarity with the equivalent functional domain from the e. coli laci repressor. interruption of malr by the generation of a frameshift mutation led to a 10-fold increase in malq activity. these data suggest that the identified open reading frame encodes a repressor of  the c. butyricum malq gene, and of the adjacent malp gene. the gene has, therefore, been designated malr, and its encoded gene product malr.

TI  == the glycyl radical enzyme tdce can replace pyruvate formate-lyase in glucose fermentation.
AB  == mutants of escherichia coli unable to synthesize a functional pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) are severely impaired in their capacity to grow by glucose fermentation. in a functional complementation assay designed to isolate the pfl gene from clostridium butyricum, we fortuitously identified a gene that did not encode a pfl but nonetheless was able to complement the phenotypic defects caused by an e. coli pfl mutation. the clostridial gene encoded a basic 14. 5-kda protein (tcbc) which, based on amino acid similarity and analysis of immediately  adjacent dna sequences, was part of a transposase exhibiting extensive similarity to the product of the site-specific transposon tn554 from staphylococcus aureus.  our studies revealed that the clostridial tcbc protein activated the transcription of the e. coli tdcabcdefg operon, which encodes an anaerobic l-threonine-degradative pathway. normally, anaerobic synthesis of the pathway is  optimal when e. coli grows in the absence of catabolite-repressing sugars and in  the presence of l-threonine. although anaerobic control of pathway synthesis was  maintained, tcbc alleviated glucose repression. one of the products encoded by the tdc operon, tdce, has recently been shown to be a 2-keto acid formate-lyase (c. hesslinger, s. a. fairhurst, and g. sawers, mol. microbiol. 27:477-492, 1998) that can accept pyruvate as an enzyme substrate. here we show that tdce is directly responsible for the restoration of fermentative growth to pfl mutants.

AB  == the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (plsb) of escherichia coli is a key regulatory enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in phospholipid biosynthesis. we report the initial characterization of a novel gene (termed plsd) from clostridium butyricum, cloned based on its ability to complement the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate auxotrophic phenotype of a plsb mutant strain of e. coli. unlike the 83-kda plsb acyltransferase from e. coli, the predicted plsd open reading frame encoded a protein of 26.5 kda. two regions of strong homology to other lipid acyltransferases, including plsb and plsc analogs from mammals, plants, yeast, and bacteria, were identified. plsd was most closely related to the 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (plsc) gene family but did not complement the growth of plsc(ts) mutants. an in vivo metabolic labeling experiment using a plsb plsx plsc(ts) strain of e. coli confirmed that the plsd expression restored the ability of the cells to synthesize 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate. however, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity was not detected in vitro in assays using either acyl-acyl carrier protein or acyl coenzyme a as the substrate.

TI  == molecular analysis of a clostridium butyricum ncimb 7423 gene encoding 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and characterization of the recombinant enzyme produced in escherichia coli.
AB  == an escherichia coli clone was detected in a clostridium butyricum ncimb 7423 plasmid library capable of degrading soluble amylose. deletion subcloning of its  recombinant plasmid indicated that the gene(s) responsible for amylose degradation was localized on a 1.8 kb nsphi-scal fragment. this region was sequenced in its entirety and shown to encompass a large orf capable of encoding  a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 57,184 da. although the deduced amino acid sequence showed only weak similarity with known amylases, significant  sequences identity was apparent with the 4-alpha-glucano-transferase enzymes of streptococcus pneumoniae (46.9%), potato (42.9%) and e. coli (16.2%). the clostridial gene (designated maiq) was followed by a second orf which, through its homology to the equivalent enzymes of e. coli and s. pneumoniae, was deduced  to encode maltodextrin phosphorylase (maip). the translation stop codon of maiq overlapped the translation start codon of the putative maip gene, suggesting that the two genes may be both transcriptionally and translationally coupled. 4-alpha-glucanotransferase catalyses a disproportionation reaction in which single or multiple glucose units from oligosaccharides are transferred to the 4-hydroxyl group of acceptor sugars. characterization of the recombinant c. butyricum enzyme demonstrated that glucose, maltose and maltotriose could act as  acceptor, whereas of the three only maltotriose could act as donor. the enzyme therefore shares properties with the e. coli maiq protein, but differs significantly from the glucanotransferase of thermotoga maritima, which is unable to use maltotriose as donor or glucose as acceptor. physiologically, the concerted action of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and maltodextrin phosphorylase provides c. butyricum with a mechanism of utilizing amylose/maltodextrins with little drain on cellular atp reserves.

TI  == clostridial infection in children.
AB  == a survey of the isolation of clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. the isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified clostridium spp., 37 (33%) c. perfringens, 13 (12%) c. ramosum, five (4%) c. innocuum, six (5%) c. botulinum, three (3%) c. difficile, two (2%) c. butyricum, and one isolate each of c. bifermentans, c. clostridiiforme, c. limosum and c. paraputrificum. most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. these were  immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). the clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. the species most  commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group) (50), escherichia coli (22), pigmented prevotella or porphyromonas spp. (18) and fusobacterium spp. (10). most bacteroides and escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck  sites. antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). only two patients died. these data illustrate the  importance of clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.

TI  == gene probes for identification of the botulinal neurotoxin gene and specific identification of neurotoxin types b, e, and f.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction method was developed for the specific detection of the botulinum neurotoxin (bont) gene of clostridium botulinum. degenerate oligonucleotide primers, designed from the nucleotide sequence of the heavy chain of the bont gene, amplified a specific fragment of approximately 1.1 kb from strains of c. botulinum toxin types a, b, e, f, and g and neurotoxin-producing strains of clostridium barati and clostridium butyricum, but no fragment was obtained from nontoxigenic strains. the fragments amplified from several strains  of c. botulinum types b, e, and f were cloned in escherichia coli and their nucleotide sequences were determined. sequences within this region were used to design oligonucleotide probes specific for bont type b (bont/b), bont/e, and bont/f genes. an additional probe was designed for the detection of the bont/f gene of c. barati, which differed in sequence from bont/f genes of both proteolytic and nonproteolytic strains of c. botulinum.

TI  == nonspecific phospholipase c of listeria monocytogenes: activity on phospholipids  in triton x-100-mixed micelles and in biological membranes.
AB  == listeria monocytogenes secretes a phospholipase c (plc) which has 39% amino acid  sequence identity with the broad-specificity plc from bacillus cereus. recent work indicates that the l. monocytogenes enzyme plays a role during infections of mammalian cells (j.-a. vazquez-boland, c. kocks, s. dramsi, h. ohayon, c. geoffroy, j. mengaud, and p. cossart, infect. immun. 60:219-230, 1992). the homogeneous enzyme has a specific activity of 230 mumol/min/mg when phosphatidylcholine (pc) is dispersed in sodium deoxycholate. with phospholipid-triton x-100 mixed micelles, the enzyme had a broad ph optimum between 5.5 and 8.0, and the rates of lipid hydrolysis were in the following order: pc > phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) > phosphatidylserine > sphingomyelin >> phosphatidylinositol (pi). activity on pc was stimulated 35% by 0.5 m nacl and 60% by 0.05 mm znso4. when escherichia coli phospholipids were dispersed in triton x-100, pe and phosphatidylglycerol, but not cardiolipin, were hydrolyzed.  the enzyme was active on all phospholipids of vesiculated human erythrocytes including pi, which was rapidly hydrolyzed at ph 7.0. pi was also hydrolyzed in pi-pc-cholesterol liposomes by the nonspecific plc from l. monocytogenes and by the homologous enzyme from b. cereus. the water-soluble hydrolysis product was identified as inositol-1-phosphate. for the hydrolysis of human erythrocyte ghost phospholipids, a broad ph optimum was also observed. 32p-labelled clostridium butyricum protoplasts, which are rich in ether lipids, were treated with plc. the enzyme hydrolyzed the plasmalogen form of pe, its glycerol acetal, and cardiolipin, in addition to pe. i-, cl- and f- stimulated activity on either pc-  triton x-100 mixed micelles or human erythrocyte ghosts, unlike the enzyme from b. cereus which is strongly inhibited by halides. tris-hcl, phosphate, and calcium nitrate had similar inhibitory effects on the enzyme on the enzymes from  l. monocytogenes and b. cereus.

TI  == cloning of a dna fragment encoding the 5'-terminus of the botulinum type e toxin  gene from clostridium butyricum strain bl6340.
AB  == chromosomal dna was extracted from toxigenic clostridium butyricum strain bl6340  isolated from a case of infant botulism. after digestion by ecori, a dna fragment of about 1 kbp was cloned into escherichia coli using lambda gt11, and was subcloned into puc118. the e. coli cells transformed with this cloned fragment produced a 33 kda protein which reacted with monoclonal antibodies recognizing the light chain (lc) component of botulinum type e toxin. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment was determined. the sequence was similar to that from botulinum type e toxin gene fragments previously determined by our laboratory (strains mashike, otaru and iwanai). several highly homologous sequences among the botulinum type a, c, e, butyricum and tetanus toxin genes were found in both  translated and untranslated regions. these results suggest that the toxin gene of c. butyricum may have evolved by transfer from c. botulinum.

TI  == conjugative plasmid transfer from escherichia coli to clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == the conjugation mechanism of incp plasmids may be employed to mobilize small non-conjugative plasmids from escherichia coli to a wide range of different organisms. this strategy has been adapted for use with the gram-positive anaerobe, clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052. several shuttle vectors containing replicons from pam beta 1 (enterococcus faecalis), pcb101 (clostridium butyricum) or pwv01 (streptococcus cremoris), together with the cis-acting orit region of rk2, have been constructed, and transferred to and established in this  organism. one of the vectors apparently contains a hot spot for insertion of is1. conjugative mobilization of plasmids from e. coli will provide a useful alternative to electroporation for effecting gene transfer to this industrially important anaerobe.

TI  == cloning of two chloramphenicol acetyltransferase genes from clostridium butyricum and their expression in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis.
AB  == two non-homologous chloramphenicol (cm) acetyltransferase (cat) genes, designated cata and catb, were cloned from clostridium butyricum type strains and characterized by restriction mapping. both genes are efficiently expressed in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. in contrast to analogous genes from staphylococci and bacilli, gene expression is not dependent on induction by cm. the genes are considered as chromosomal, since no association with endogenous plasmids was detectable. southern hybridization revealed a homology between cata  and the staphylococcal cm resistance plasmid, pc194. the subunit size of the clostridial cat enzymes expressed in e. coli was determined as 22.5 kda (cata) and 24 kda (catb), respectively. the c. butyricum cat genes provide potentially useful selection markers for the construction of cloning vectors from cryptic clostridial plasmids.

TI  == [implantation of a mutant of escherichia coli requiring diaminopimelic acid in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice].
AB  == a dap- auxotroph mutant of escherichia coli dp50 requiring dap and thymidine for  growth was used as the receptor strain in genetic engineering. it failed to be implanted in axenic mice. however, when an inoculum containing more than 10(7) bacteria/ml was used, the dap+ reverse mutant devoid of requirement for dap became implanted. when axenic mice were previously associated with clostridium difficile containing dap in the cell wall, the strain dap- became implanted even  when the inoculum was too small to permit implantation in axenic mice. conversely, c. butyricum and c. perenne, whose cell walls also contain dap, did not allow the establishment of a dap- mutant. in animals associated with complex  human flora without enterobacteria, neither of the 2 dap- and dap+ mutants became implanted.

TI  == identification of restriction fragments from two cryptic clostridium butyricum plasmids that promote the establishment of a replication-defective plasmid in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == clostridium butyricum ncib 7423 carries two cryptic plasmids, pcb101 (6.05 kbp) and pcb102 (7.8 kbp). sites for the restriction enzymes ecori, ecorv, hindiii, clai and psti have been found in one or both of these plasmids and their relative positions determined. restriction fragments from both plasmids have been inserted into a vector plasmid (pjab1) that is able to replicate in escherichia coli but not in bacillus subtilis and the recombinant plasmids have been established in e. coli. a 3.3 kbp sau3a fragment of pcb101 conferred upon the vector the ability to transform both rec+ and rec- strains of b. subtilis. plasmid prb1, a representative chimaera carrying only the 3.3 kbp sau3a fragment of pcb101, was successfully transferred from b. subtilis back to e. coli. plasmid prb1 was readily lost from b. subtilis in the absence of selection. this evidence, together with the results of hybridization experiments, suggests that prb1 is present as a weakly replicating autonomous element in b. subtilis. a recombinant  plasmid carrying a 2.0 kbp sau3a fragment of pcb102 underwent integration into the b. subtilis chromosome.

TI  == inhibition of the autoxidation of ascorbate and norepinephrine by extracts of clostridium butyricum, megasphaera elsdenii and escherichia coli.
AB  == the autoxidation of ascorbate and of norepinephrine in krebs ringer phosphate medium, ph 7.4, was studied. the autoxidation of the two substances was determined spectrophotometrically at 265 and 480 nm respectively. the effect of dialyzed extracts (m.w. greater than 12,000) from escherichia coli (aerobe), megasphaera elsdenii, and clostridium butyricum (obligate anaerobes) was examined and compared to similarly prepared extracts from rat serum and cerebral cortex. the assay medium contained cellular components diluted 10(3)-10(6)-fold. up to 10(4)-fold dilution there was a substantial reduction in the rate of both autoxidation reactions, but the preparations from m. elsdenii and c. butyricum were conspicuously less effective. after 5 min heat treatment at 100 degrees c the anaerobic preparations produced less than 20% inhibition, while the activity  of the other preparations remained unchanged at 75-95% inhibition. these and earlier experiments involving additional mammalian species (mishra and kovachich, neurosci. lett., 43: 103-108, 1983) and plants (mishra and kovachich, life sci.,  34: 2207-2212, 1984) suggest that a high level of heat-stable antioxidant activity in one or both of these autoxidation tests (denatured plant extracts only inhibit ascorbate autoxidation) is a general characteristic of organisms that thrive in oxygen-rich atmosphere.

TI  == survey, purification, and properties of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms.
AB  == sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase was purified approximately 500- to 600-fold to apparent homogeneity from escherichia coli b, escherichia coli c, escherichia coli var. communior, escherichia acidilactici, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria  meningitidis, and saccharomyces cereviseae. the molecular weights of the enzyme as estimated by gel filtration ranged from 97 x 10(3) to 101 x 10(3). the enzyme  was composed of two subunits with the same molecular weight which ranged from 50  x 10(3) to 52 x 10(3), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. homogeneous enzyme preparations hydrolyse all the tested alpha-d-aldohexose 1-phosphate, d-(keto or aldo)hexose 6-phosphate, and pentose phosphate substrates significantly. when the microorganisms were transferred from growth medium with 1% glucose to that without glucose, there were dramatic increases in both the specific and total enzyme activities. at least three isozymes appeared to be present in s. cereviseae, and two appeared to be present  in e. coli b, e. coli var. communior, and n. meningitidis. rabbit antiserum immunized against sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase purified from e. coli b cross-reacted with both the crude extracts and purified preparations of the enzyme from the other microorganisms. the presence of neither sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase activity nor immunocrossreacting material was detected in the following microorganisms: aspergillus niger, azotobacter chroococcum, bacillus subtilis, bacillus pumilis, citrobacter freundii, clostridium butyricum, corynebacterium xerosis, flavobacterium aquatile, flavobacterium synxanthum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, micrococcus coralinus, neisseria perflava, neurospora crassa, penicilium expansum, penicilium notatum, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas fluorescens, saccharomyces fermenti, sarcina lutea, and streptomyces antibioticus. at present, no conclusive relationship can be established between the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system and the enzyme sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms. the physiological role of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase as a transferase and regulatory enzyme is discussed.

TI  == development of gut colonisation in pre-term neonates.
AB  == twenty-eight pre-term babies of low birth weight were monitored for developing microflora in throat, stomach and faeces during the first 3 weeks of life. the flora at all levels of the gastrointestinal tract differed from that of healthy breast-fed and artificially fed full-term babies. colonisation of throat and stomach was delayed beyond 4 days of life in 87% and 60% of babies respectively.  only 10% of babies had "normal" oral flora throughout the period of study. flora  of the stomach was sparse, and resembled faecal flora. faecal flora was established more rapidly than throat or stomach flora, and 70% of babies were colonised during the first 4 days of life. initially bacteroides spp. were predominant (57% babies), but escherichia coli and other aerobic gram-negative bacilli gradually increased in frequency. colonisation by gram-positive bacteria  was slow. clostridium spp. were present in only 10% of babies during the first 4  days of life. most strains were transient. colonisation with c. butyricum (30%),  c. perfringens (35%) and c. difficile (25%) was maximum after the first 2 weeks of life. lactic-acid-producing bacteria usually appeared late in the third week of life. parenteral feeding immediately after birth was associated with delayed colonisation by a restricted number of species. parenteral antibiotics (penicillin or gentamicin or both) restricted colonisation with normal oral flora, the lactic-acid-producing bacteria and penicillin-sensitive clostridia, but had little effect on e. coli even when the colonising strain was sensitive to the aminoglycoside in the regimen. systemic spread of bacteria via the blood stream was not detected in any babies. the pattern of colonisation of the enteric tract in pre-term infants in the special-care nursery studied, differs from that  of healthy full-term babies; this merits consideration when the results of bacteriological tests of this vulnerable group of infants are being interpreted.

TI  == the enzymes of phospholipid synthesis in clostridium butyricum.
AB  == we have examined extracts of clostridium butyricum for several enzymes of phospholipid synthesis. membrane particles were shown to catalyze the formation of cdp-diglyceride from [3h]ctp and phosphatidic acid. the reaction was dependent on mg2+ and stimulated by monovalent cations. cdp-diglyceride formed in vitro was found to be a substrate for both phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthetase and phosphatidylserine synthetase. the formation of phosphatidylglycerophosphate from added cdp-diglyceride and [u-14c]sn-glycerol-3-phosphate was dependent on mg2+ and triton x-100. the dephosphorylation of endogenously-generated phosphatidylglycerophosphate to yield phosphatidylglycerol was observed to be ph-dependent. the formation of phosphatidylserine from cdp-diglyceride and l-[3-14c]serine was stimulated by mg2+ and triton x-100. dcdp-diglyceride was a suitable substrate for both phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthetase and phosphatidylserine synthetase. phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity was barely detectable in membrane particles from c. butyricum. the addition of e. coli membrane particles provided efficient phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity in this system. although plasmalogens are the principal lipids of c. butyricum, none of the products of phospholipid synthesis formed in vitro contained measurable amounts of plasmalogens. the subcellular distribution of both phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthetase and phosphatidylserine synthetase in c. butyricum was also studied. both were found to be membrane-associated.
