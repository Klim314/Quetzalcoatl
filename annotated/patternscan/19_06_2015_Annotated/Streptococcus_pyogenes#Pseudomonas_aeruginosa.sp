TI  == nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in japan.
AB  == the japanese three academic societies joint antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. the surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments  of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between january 2011 and  june 2012 were investigated. the collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected  bacteria was measured at the kitasato university research center for infections and antimicrobials. the surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., and fusobacterium spp.). bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. we compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. the age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. we were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant h. influenzae. we suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of native california medicinal plant extracts isolated from rhamnus californica and umbellularia californica.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance (amr) is a major threat to global public health. medicinal plants have long been used as remedies for infectious diseases  by native cultures around the world and have the potential for providing effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. rhamnus californica (rhamnaceae) and umbellularia californica (lauraceae) are two indigenous california plant species historically used by native americans to treat skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. this study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of r. and  u. californica against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods: methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of r. and u. californica were prepared by soxhlet extraction and  evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyogenes, mycobacterium smegmatis, staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, escherichia coli  and pseudomonas aeruginosa using disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) assays. chemical profiling of the extracts was performed using standard methods. results: all extracts inhibited the growth of mrsa and other gram-positive bacteria with mics of 3.3-6.0 mg/ml. gram-negative organisms  were unaffected by these extracts. u. californica extracts (leaves and bark) had  the lowest mic values. chemical profiling detected the presence of quinones, alkaloids, flavonoids, cardenolides, tannins and saponins in these extracts. our  study is the first to report the antimicrobial properties of r. and u. californica and illustrates their promising anti-mrsa potential. conclusions: our results give scientific credence to the traditional medicinal uses of these plants by the indigenous peoples of california. further investigation of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against mrsa is warranted.

TI  == discrepancy in maldi-tof ms identification of uncommon gram-negative bacteria from lower respiratory secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == introduction: early identification of microbial organisms from respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) is important to guide therapeutic decisions. the objective was to compare the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) relative to the conventional phenotypic method in identifying common bacterial isolates, including nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria, in a cohort of patients with cf. methods: a total of 123 isolates from 50 patients with cf representing 14 bacterial species from respiratory specimens were identified using maldi-tof ms in parallel with conventional phenotypic methods. discrepancies were confirmed by 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing in five  gram-negative isolates. results: the maldi-tof ms managed to identify 122/123 (99.2%) bacterial isolates to the genus level and 118/123 (95.9%) were identified to the species level. the maldi-tof ms results were 100% consistent to the species level with conventional phenotypic identification for isolates of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, achromobacter xylosoxidans, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other uncommon organisms such as chryseobacterium gleum and enterobacter cloacae. the 5/123 (4.6%) isolates misidentified were all gram-negative bacteria. the isolation of e. cloacae and haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus may extend the potentially pathogenic list of organisms isolated from patients with cf. conclusion: although the technique provides an early identification and antimicrobial therapy approach in patients with cf, limitation in the diagnosis of uncommon gram-negative bacteria may exist.

TI  == development of gendine coated cannula for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for extended use.
AB  == continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (csii) using pumps is a widely used method for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. one of the major factors that usually lead to the discontinuation of csii is csii set related issues including infection at the infusion site. current american diabetic association recommends rotating sites every 2-3 days. this adds cost and creates  inconvenience. therefore, in order to prevent infections and extend durations between insertion site changes, we have developed a teflon cannula coated with the combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine (gendine) and tested its antimicrobial efficacy against different pathogens. cannulas were coated with gendine on exterior surface and dried. efficacy and durability of gendine cannulas was determined against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin- susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and candida glabrata using biofilm colonization method. cytotoxicity of gendine was assessed against mouse fibroblast cell lines. gendine cannulas showed complete prevention of biofilm colonization of all organisms tested up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001) compared to uncoated control. gendine catheter against mouse fibroblast cells shown to be non-cytotoxic. our in vitro results show that a novel gendine cannula is highly effective in completely inhibiting biofilm of multi-drug resistant pathogens for  up to 2 weeks and may have potential clinical applications such as prolonged use, cost reduction and decreased infection rate.

TI  == zebrafish fed on recombinant artemia expressing epinecidin-1 exhibit increased survival and altered expression of immunomodulatory genes upon vibrio vulnificus  infection.
AB  == artemia has been used extensively in aquaculture as fodder for larval fish, shrimp, and shellfish. epinecidin-1, an antimicrobial peptide, was isolated from  grouper (epinephelus coioides) in 2005. epinecidin-1 has been previously reported to possess antimicrobial activity against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species, including staphylococcus coagulase, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes, and vibrio vulnificus. in this study, we used electroporation to introduce plasmid dna encoding a green fluorescent protein (egfp)-epinecidin-1 fusion protein under the control of the cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter into decapsulated artemia cysts. optimization of various properties (including cyst weight (0.2 g), plasmid concentration (50 mug/100 mul), and pulse voltage (150 v), length (10 ms), and number (2)) resulted in a hatching rate of 41.15%, a transfection efficiency of 49.81%, and a fluorescence intensity (a.u.)  of 47.46. the expression of egfp-epinecidin-1 was first detected by quantitative  rt-pcr at 120 h post-electroporation, and protein was identified by western blot  at the same time. furthermore, the egfp-epinecidin-1 protein inhibited v. vulnificus (204) growth, as demonstrated by zone of inhibition studies. zebrafish fed on transgenic artemia expressing cmv-gfp-epi combined with commercial fodder  were more resistant to infection by v. vulnificus (204): survival rate was enhanced by over 70% at 7, 14, and 21 days post-infection, and bacterial numbers  in the liver and intestine were reduced. in addition, feeding of transgenic artemia to zebrafish affected the immunomodulatory response to v. vulnificus (204) infection; expression of immune-responsive genes, including hepcidin and defbl2, was altered, as shown by qpcr. these findings suggest that feeding transgenic artemia expressing cmv-gfp-epi to larval fish has antimicrobial effects, without the drawbacks of introducing drug residues or inducing bacterial drug resistance.

AB  == objective: we assessed clinical, radiological, laboratory and microbiological findings in children with acute mastoiditis in order to improve the diagnostics and treatment of these patients. we also investigated whether different pathogens cause different clinical findings of mastoiditis. methods: a retrospective review of the medical records of all children aged 0-16 years treated as in-ward patients for acute mastoiditis at helsinki university central hospital, department of otorhinolaryngology, between 2003 and 2012. results: fifty-six patients met the inclusion criteria. the incidence of mastoiditis was 1.88/100000/year. the most common pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae (38%),  streptococcus pyogenes (11%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%). of s. pneumoniae,  48% had reduced susceptibility (intermediate or resistant) for the common antimicrobials; this was clearly overrepresented relative to the background population (p<0.001). otalgia and retroauricular symptoms were common in the patients with s. pneumoniae. otorrhoea was less common (p=0.03) in these patients relative to the other pathogens. patients with s. pneumoniae had more destruction of the mastoid septa (p=0.05) than patients with any of the other pathogens. mastoidectomy was performed in 34% of all cases, it was most common (60%) in the  patients with s. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility. the patients with s. pyogenes had less otalgia and seemed to have less retroauricular symptoms relative to other pathogens. p. aeruginosa especially affected children with tympanostomy tubes, caused otorrhoea in all patients and caused a milder form of  disease with less retroauricular swelling (p=0.04) than the other pathogens, and  there was no need for mastoidectomies. the younger children (<2 years) had less otorrhoea and more retroauricular symptoms of infection than the older patients.  no significant differences emerged in outcome of the patient groups. conclusions: the clinical findings of acute mastoiditis differ according to the causative pathogen. s. pneumoniae, especially strains with reduced susceptibility, causes severe symptoms and leads to mastoidectomy more often than the other pathogens. s. pyogenes causes less otalgia than the other pathogens. p. aeruginosa particularly affects children with tympanostomy tubes and causes a less aggressive form of disease.

TI  == filtration of crushed tablet suspensions has potential to reduce infection incidence in people who inject drugs.
AB  == introduction and aims: the medical complications of injecting preparations from crushed tablets can be severe, and most can be attributed to the injection of insoluble particles and micro-organisms. previously we have shown that most of the particles can be removed by filtration, but it was not known whether bacteria could also be filtered in the presence of a high particle load. this study aims to determine the feasibility of filtration to remove bacteria from injections prepared from tablets. design and methods: injections were prepared from crushed  slow-release morphine tablets, in mixed bacterial suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the injection suspensions were passed through syringe filters of porosity 0.45 or 0.20 mum, or  combined 0.8 then 0.2 mum, and the bacterial load was counted. results: bacterial concentrations in unfiltered injections were 2.5-4.3 x 10(6) colony forming units ml(-1) . both the 0.20 and 0.45 mum filters blocked unless a prefilter (cigarette filter) was used first. the 0.2 mum filter and the combined 0.8/0.2 mum filter reduced the bacteria to the limit of detection (10 colony forming units ml(-1) )  or below. filtration through a 0.45 mum filter was slightly less effective. discussion and conclusions: use of a 0.2 mum filter, together with other injection hygiene measures, offers the prospect of greatly reducing the medical complications of injecting crushed tablets and should be considered as a highly effective harm reduction method. it is very likely that these benefits would also apply to other illicit drug injections, although validation studies are needed.

TI  == a study on the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved  in skin and meibomian gland lesions of demodectic mange in cattle.
AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == novel chromogenic aminopeptidase substrates for the detection and identification  of clinically important microorganisms.
AB  == a series of amino acid derivatives 8-10, 42 and 43 have been prepared as chromogenic enzyme substrates in order to detect aminopeptidase activity in clinically important gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. enzymatic hydrolysis liberates the amino acid moiety and either a 4-aminophenol or a 4-dialkylaminoaniline derivative which undergoes oxidative coupling with 1-naphthol or a substituted 1-naphthol giving an indophenol dye. substrates and 1-naphthols were incorporated into an agar-based culture medium and this allowed  growth of intensely coloured bacterial colonies based on hydrolysis by specific enzymes. red/pink coloured colonies were produced by the substrates 8-10 and blue coloured colonies were formed by the substrates 42 and 43. the l-alanyl aminopeptidase substrates 8 targeted l-alanyl aminopeptidase activity and gave coloured colonies with a range of gram-negative bacteria. substrates 9 targeted beta-alanyl aminopeptidase activity and generated coloured colonies with selected gram-negative species including pseudomonas aeruginosa. three substrates for l-pyroglutamyl acid aminopeptidase (10a, 10c and 43) were hydrolysed by enterococci and streptococcus pyogenes to generate coloured colonies. two yeasts  were also included in the study, but they did not produce coloured colonies with  any of the substrates examined.

TI  == dual stimulation with bacterial and viral components increases the expression of  hepcidin in human monocytes.
AB  == hepcidin belongs to the antimicrobial peptide (amp) family and is the key regulator of iron metabolism. it modulates iron homeostasis by binding to, and degrading the iron exporter molecule, ferroportin, thus inhibiting cellular iron  efflux. many antimicrobial peptides have a dual function; some are able to act directly as an antimicrobial agent as well as having an immunoregulatory role in  the host. toll-like receptors (tlrs) bind to components of microorganisms, activate cellular signal transduction pathways and stimulate innate immune responses. the effect of tlr3 (poly i:c) and tlr9 (cpg) co-stimulation of thp-1-derived monocytes using purified tlr ligands showed that 24 h after exposure poly i:c and cpg ligands in combination, hepcidin expression was significantly increased (10-fold) when compared to the untreated control. this combination of tlr ligands mimics simultaneous bacterial and viral infections, thus suggesting a potential key role for hepcidin in combined infections. additionally, using a chequerboard assay, we have shown that hepcidin has an antagonistic effect in combination with the antibiotics rifampicin and tetracycline against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes, evidenced by a fractional inhibitory concentration index  (fici) > 4. this finding has important implications for future treatment regimens especially in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides are highly abundant and active in postoperative pleural drainage fluids.
AB  == background: the human lung is considered a nonsterile organ, and surgical interventions therefore take place in a more or less contaminated operating field. nevertheless, infectious complications of the pleural cavity are low after major lung resections. antimicrobial peptides (amps) are part of the innate immunity and display a broad capacity to kill pathogens. we hypothesized that the pleural space must have a high natural antimicrobial barrier and that amps might  effectively protect the pleural cavity. methods: pleural effusions were collected after lung operations. antimicrobial activity of the fluids against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens was analyzed by microdilution assays. amps were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and immunohistochemical analysis. the impact of proinflammatory triggers on amp release from pleural mesothelial cells was evaluated. results: antimicrobial activity assays revealed high bactericidal properties of postoperative pleural drainage fluids. they effectively killed gram-negative pathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) as well as gram-positive pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes). a variety of amps was detected at constantly high concentrations in the pleural fluids. they mainly derived from leukocytes and pleural epithelium. although proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in the postoperative pleural fluids, amp expression could not be augmented by toll-like receptor (tlr) triggering or by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (il)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)alpha. conclusions: we provide the first evidence of a high  abundance of amps in postoperative pleural fluids. our findings might explain the broad protection against infectious complications of the pleural space after major lung operations.

TI  == hospitalist perspective on the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  == the prevalence of skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) has been increasing in  the united states. these infections are associated with an increase in hospital admissions. hospitalists play an increasingly important role in the management of these infections and need to use hospital resources efficiently and effectively.  when available, observation units are useful for treating low-risk patients who do not require hospital admission. imaging tools may help to exclude abscesses and necrotizing soft tissue infections; however, surgical exploration remains the principal means of diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections. the most common pathogens that cause sstis are streptococci and staphylococcus aureus. methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) is a prevalent pathogen, and concerns are increasing regarding the unclear distinctions between community-acquired and hospital-acquired mrsa. other less frequent pathogens that cause sstis include enterococcus species, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, enterobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cephalexin and clindamycin are suitable options for infections caused by streptococcal species and methicillin-susceptible s aureus.  the increasing resistance of s aureus and streptococcus pyogenes to erythromycin  limits its use in these infections, and better alternatives are available. parenteral cefazolin, nafcillin, or oxacillin can be used in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis caused by streptococci and methicillin-susceptible s aureus. when oral mrsa therapy is indicated, clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or linezolid is appropriate. vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, telavancin, and ceftaroline fosamil are intravenous options that should be used in mrsa infections that require patient hospitalization. in the treatment of patients with sstis, hospitalists are at the forefront of providing proper patient care that reduces hospital costs, duration of therapy, and therapeutic failures. this  review updates guidelines on the management of sstis with a focus on infections caused by s aureus, particularly mrsa, and outlines the role of the hospitalist in the effective management of sstis.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria.
AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

TI  == influence of bacterial presence on biofilm formation of candida albicans.
AB  == purpose: candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in  human microflora. biofilm formation (bf) is known as a major virulence factor of  c. albicans. the aim of this study was to examine the influence of bacterial presence on biofilm formation of c. albicans. materials and methods: the bf of candida was investigated when it was co-cultured with c. albicans (c. albicans 53, a yeast with a low bf ability, and c. albicans 163, a yeast with high bf ability) and bacteria. bf was assessed with xtt reduction assay. a scanning electron microscope was used to determine the structure of the biofilm, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify and quantify hyphae-associated genes. results: co-culturing with two different types  of bacteria increased the bf value. co-culturing with c. albicans 53 and 163 also increased the bf value compared to the value that was obtained when the c. albicans was cultured individually. however, co-culturing with bacteria decreased the bf value of c. albicans, and the bf of c. albicans 163 was markedly inhibited. the expression of adherence and morphology transition related genes were significantly inhibited by co-culturing with live bacteria. conclusion: bacteria have a negative effect on the formation of biofilm by c. albicans. this  mechanism is the result of the suppression of genes associated with the hyphae transition of c. albicans, and bacteria particles physically affected the biofilm architecture and biofilm formation.

AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane  and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were  assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane  isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly lucilia cuprina.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly lucilia sericata (meigen) (diptera:calliphoridae) against bacteria. however, the antibacterial activity of  its sibling species, lucilia cuprina (wiedemann) (diptera:calliphoridae) against  a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. the aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of l. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). the turbidimetric assay demonstrated that l. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (p < 0.001). additionally, colony-forming unit (cfu), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against p. aeruginosa. the reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. these observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.

TI  == resistance of acellular dermal matrix materials to microbial penetration.
AB  == importance: acellular dermal matrices have many current and potential applications, but their long-term safety has not been extensively studied. in particular, limited information exists regarding such materials' resistance to infection. objective: to assess the resistance to microbial penetration of common acellular dermal matrix materials used in reconstruction after skin cancer excision, treatment of chronic ulcers and burns, breast reconstruction, hernia repairs, and other applications. design: comparative in vitro study of 4 commercially available dermal substitutes for their ability to act as barriers to penetration by common skin pathogens. setting: university-based dermatology and plastic surgery departments and a hospital microbiology laboratory. materials: four commercially available dermal substitutes, including alloderm (lifecell), flexhd (musculoskeletal transplant foundation), strattice (lifecell), and neoform (mentor corporation). intervention: we tested the 4 dermal matrix materials with  the following 4 organisms commonly implicated in wound infections: staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes, and candida albicans. each material was inoculated with the same concentration of each pathogen. main outcome measure: the number of bacterial colonies grown on blood agar plates. results: alloderm and rehydrated flexhd were found to be the best barriers to penetration by p. aeruginosa. alloderm, flexhd, and strattice also prevented penetration by s. aureus and s. pyogenes; neoform was less effective in withstanding these organisms. the results of this study were inconclusive with regard to c. albicans penetration. conclusions and relevance: three of the 4 commonly used acellular dermal matrix materials are resistant to in vitro penetration by s. aureus and s. pyogenes and partially resistant to p. aeruginosa. resistance to fungal pathogens is uncertain. antimicrobial differences across matrix materials may influence their selection for particular  uses, such as treatment of refractory leg ulcers or reconstruction after skin cancer excision.

AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

AB  == sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such  as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/=  128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous  pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral,  oral, and switch therapies.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == necrotizing soft tissue infection of the breast: case report and literature review.
AB  == background: necrotizing soft tissue infection (nsti) is characterized by progressive infectious gangrene of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. its treatment involves intensive care, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and full debridement. methods: we present two cases of nsti of the breast, adding these cases to the 14 described in the literature, reviewing the characteristics and evolution of all cases. case report: on the fourth day after mastectomy, a 59-year-old woman with ulcerated breast cancer developed type i nsti caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had a favorable evolution after debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics. the second patient was a 57-year-old woman submitted  to a mastectomy and axillary dissection, who had recurrent seromas. on the 32nd post-operative day, after a seroma puncture, she developed type ii nsti caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci. she developed sepsis and died on the tenth day after debridement, intensive care, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. the cases are the first description of breast nsti after mammary seroma aspiration and the first report of this condition caused by p. aeruginosa. conclusion: necrotizing soft tissue infection is rare in breast tissue. it frequently is of type ii, occurring mainly after procedures in patients with breast cancer. the surgeon's participation in controlling the focus of the infection is of fundamental importance, and just as important are broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and support measures, such as maintenance of volume, correction of electrolytic disorders, and treatment of sepsis and septic shock. once the infection has been  brought under control, skin grafting or soft tissue flaps can be considered. the  mortality rate in breast nsti is 18.7%, all deaths being in patients with the fulminant type ii form. surgical oncologists need to be alert to the possibility  of this rare condition.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in children aged 0-16 years--a national study of 678 cases in sweden comparing different age groups.
AB  == objective: to compare the characteristics of acute mastoiditis in children in different age groups in order to identify risk groups and risk factors for acute  mastoiditis. methods: records for all children aged 0-16 years treated for acute  mastoiditis during 1993-2007 at 33 ear, nose and throat departments in sweden were reviewed retrospectively according to defined criteria for acute mastoiditis. results: a total of 678 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. acute mastoiditis was most common in children younger than two years of age and this group was characterized by less prior history of other diseases and ear diseases, fewer visits to health care centers and less antibiotic treatment before admission, shorter duration of symptoms before admission, hospitalization  for fewer days and lower frequency of complications and mastoidectomies. these children also showed a higher incidence of clinical findings, increased inflammatory markers such as fever and heightened counts of c-reactive protein and white blood cells compared with older children. they also tested positive for significantly more samples of streptococcus pneumoniae while the older children more often exhibited growth of streptococcus pyogenes or pseudomonas aeruginosa or no microbial growth. conclusions: the characteristics of pediatric acute mastoiditis differed significantly between age groups. acute mastoiditis was most common in children younger than two years of age. they showed more rapid progress of symptoms and more distinct signs of acute mastoiditis. this is probably the reason why parents rapidly seek medical care for small children and hospital treatment thus starts earlier in the youngest children, which may in turn explain the excellent outcome. this study showed that younger children have neither more  severe acute mastoiditis nor more complications than older ones. the differences  between age groups suggest that there are distinctions in the pathophysiology behind the onset and course of acute mastoiditis in younger and older children.

TI  == glycerol monolaurate antibacterial activity in broth and biofilm cultures.
AB  == background: glycerol monolaurate (gml) is an antimicrobial agent that has potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria. this study examines gml antibacterial activity in comparison to lauric acid, in broth cultures compared to biofilm cultures, and against a wide range of gram-positive, gram-negative, and non-gram  staining bacteria. methodology/principal findings: gml is >/= 200 times more effective than lauric acid in bactericidal activity, defined as a >/= 3 log reduction in colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes in broth cultures. both molecules inhibit superantigen production by these organisms at concentrations that are not bactericidal. gml prevents biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, as representative gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, tested in 96 well microtiter plates, and simultaneously is bactericidal for both organisms in mature biofilms. gml is bactericidal for a wide range of potential bacterial pathogens, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. in the presence of acidic ph and the cation chelator ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid,  gml has greatly enhanced bactericidal activity for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. solubilization of gml in a nonaqueous delivery vehicle (related to k-y warming(r)) enhances its bactericidal activity against s. aureus. both r and s, and 1 and 2 position lauric acid derivatives of gml exhibit bactericidal activity. despite year-long passage of staphylococcus aureus on sub-growth inhibitory concentrations of gml (0.5 x minimum bactericidal concentration), resistance to gml did not develop. conclusions/significance: gml  may be useful as a broad-spectrum human or animal topical microbicide and may be  useful as an environmental surface microbicide for management of bacterial infections and contamination.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == [daptomycin in diabetic patients].
AB  == in diabetic patients, there is a high prevalence of skin or nasal carriage of staphylococcus aureus, which is associated with an increased risk of local or systemic infections and consequently with greater morbidity and mortality. the microorganisms causing most infections in diabetic ulcers and diabetic foot are s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, although chronic diabetic foot infections are generally polymicrobial, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteria. the present article describes experience with daptomycin in the treatment of the  most frequent infectious complications in diabetic patients. the cubicin outcomes registry and experience (core) registry contains information on 60 patients with  skin and soft tissue infections treated with daptomycin, with a success rate of 83%. other recent studies comparing daptomycin with vancomycin or semi-synthetic  penicillins have also shown the efficacy and safety of daptomycin with cure rates of between 70% and 80%. in the european version of the core registry, the eurocore, diabetic patients who developed bacteremia or endocarditis due to gram-positive pathogens and who received daptomycin showed success rates of 76.8% and 72%, respectively. no significant differences were found in a study comparing daptomycin or standard therapy with vancomycin in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or antistaphylococcal penicillin in methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) in diabetic patients with bacteremia or endocarditis. because of its rapid bactericidal action and scarce adverse effects, daptomycin is an attractive antimicrobial agent in the treatment of gram-positive infections in diabetic patients, whether in monotherapy or in association with other agents.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of marine sponge clathria indica (dendy, 1889).
AB  == sponges are sessile filter feeders that have developed efficient defense mechanisms against foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria or eukaryotic organisms. antimicrobial peptides are known as major components of the innate immune defense system in marine invertebrates. the aim of the present work was to study the antimicrobial properties of the indian sponge clathria indica with special reference to the identification of antimicrobial peptides. crude methanolic extract and its chloroform, n-butanol and aqueous fractions were tested against 16 human pathogens which include eleven bacteria with four of them being multidrug resistant and five pathogenic fungi. all fractions showed effective antibacterial activity against common and multidrug-resistant salmonella typhi and antifungal activity against c. albicans and c. neoformans. however, they were ineffective against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. chloroform fraction being the most potent among the fractions tested on chemical investigation was indicative of the presence of peptides as evidenced by ninhydrin positive spots on tlc and presence of peptide bonds by nmr. its esi-ms showed presence of several peptides  in the range of m/z 850 to 980. structure of three peptides has been tentatively  assigned by esi-ms/ms or tandem mass analysis, on the basis of the amino acid sequence established. the results clearly show that the sponge c. indica represent an interesting source of marine invertebrates-derived antimicrobial peptides in the development of new strategies to treat various infectious diseases.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity and frequency of spontaneous gentamicin-resistant mutants in bacteria related skin infections].
AB  == gentamicin is used in an ointment form for the treatment of skin infections. to investigate the effect of gentamicin used as an ointment, the antimicrobial susceptibilities against staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from community and medical settings were studied and compared with other antibacterial agents such as fradiomycin, chloramphenicol, and bacitracin used as active ingredient for each ointment. gentamicin showed antibacterial activities for all standard bacteria tested, but fradiomycin and chloramphenicol showed no such activities for st. pyogenes and p. aeruginosa, respectively. bacitracin showed activity for  st. pyogenes only. the strains of staphylococci isolated from healthy people were highly susceptible to gentamicin, while 49.3% of the isolates from the patients with skin infections were resistant to gentamicin and 96.4% of the gentamicin-resistant staphylococci carried the aminoglycoside-resistance gene aaca-aphd. the growths of all strains tested, except for two strains of p. aeruginosa, were inhibited by close below 128 microg/ml of gentamicin. furthermore, the frequencies of spontaneous mutants resistant to gentamicin, fradiomycin, and chloramphenicol were each investigated using s. aureus, s. epidermidis, st. pyogenes, and p. aeruginosa. at doses of more than 32 microg/ml  of gentamicin, no resistant mutants in any of bacteria strains tested were obtained. the concentration of gentamicin on the skin was calculated at approximately 895 microg/ml at least when the commercially used 0.1% gentamicin ointment was applied to the skin. therefore, our study strongly indicates that the gentamicin ointment used has a potency of sufficiently inhibiting the growth  of bacteria, including gentamicin-resistant strains, which cause skin infections  in the community.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of a chitosan dextran-based hydrogel for surgical use.
AB  == a chitosan dextran-based (cd) hydrogel, developed for use in endoscopic sinus surgery, was tested for antimicrobial activity in vitro against a range of pathogenic microorganisms. the microdilution technique was used to determine minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and minimum fungicidal concentrations.  in addition, the time-kill efficacy of cd hydrogel was determined for two bacterial species. scanning and transmission electron microscopy were carried out to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of this compound. cd hydrogel was found  to be effective against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and clostridium perfringens at its surgical concentration of 50,000 mg/liter. minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2,000 to 50,000  mg/liter. dextran aldehyde (da) was found to be the antimicrobial component of the cd hydrogel with mbc ranging from 2,000 to 32,000 mg/liter. s. aureus appeared to be killed at a slightly faster rate than e. coli. candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa were more resistant to cd hydrogel and da. scanning and transmission electron microscopy of e. coli and s. aureus incubated with cd hydrogel and da alone revealed morphological damage, disrupted cell walls, and loss of cytosolic contents, compatible with the proposed mode of action involving binding to cell wall proteins and disruption of peptide bonds. motility and chemotaxis tests showed e. coli to be inhibited when incubated with da. the antibacterial activity of cd hydrogel may make it a useful postsurgical aid at other body sites, especially where there is a risk of gram-positive infections.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2008: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  == for the purpose of nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens collected from patients in japan, the japanese society of chemotherapy conducted a third year of nationwide surveillance during  the period from january to april 2008. a total of 1,097 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. susceptibility testing was evaluable with 987 strains (189 staphylococcus aureus, 211 streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 streptococcus pyogenes, 187 haemophilus influenzae, 106 moraxella catarrhalis, 126 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 162 pseudomonas aeruginosa). a total of 44 antibacterial agents,  including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one  monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including a ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the clinical and laboratory standard institute (clsi).  the incidence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was as high as 59.8%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp and prsp) were 35.5 and 11.8%, respectively. among h. influenzae, 13.9% of them were  found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately resistant (blnai), 26.7% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing abpc-resistant (blnar), and 5.3% to be beta-lactamase-producing abpc-resistant (blpar) strains.  a high frequency (76.5%) of beta-lactamase-producing strains was suspected in moraxella catarrhalis isolates. four (3.2%) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. four isolates (2.5%) of p. aeruginosa were found to be metallo beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9%) suspected multidrug-resistant strains showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. continual national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on  a regular basis.

TI  == microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  == most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. the most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (prevotella  and porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with hiv infection, and in cystic fibrosis. fungi and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. the microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == life-threatening cellulitis after traditional samoan tattooing.
AB  == objective: traditional samoan tattooing is a significant and valued cultural practice. any tattooing carries a risk of complications, including the potential  for serious bacterial infection. we discuss the complex nature of the public health investigation into two cases of serious bacterial infection following traditional tattooing occurring in the same region in new zealand within a six-week period. approach: description of two cases of life-threatening cellulitis (one with necrotising fasciitis) related to traditional samoan tattooing and presentation of findings from the public health investigation. discussion of the complex legal and cultural issues that arose. conclusion: our paper illustrates the potential for serious bacterial infection by tattooing when performed in a non-sterile manner. there are gaps in the regulatory framework available in new zealand to address the public health risks of unsafe tattooing practices. implications: it is important to balance the fundamental right to perform the traditional cultural practice of tattooing with the need for meticulous infection control. reducing the risk of infection will require working in partnership with the community to develop acceptable standards and guidelines  and to improve the regulatory framework.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. this study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the pdi efficacy against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa),  as well as the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by  coincubation with hematoporphyrin (hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the pdi effect or by addition after pdi and further incubation for 30 min. under  conditions in which hp-pdi killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8)  cfu/ml). similar results were also found with toluidine blue o (tbo)-mediated pdi in planktonic and biofilm cells. however, without pdi treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by pdi. further studies indicated that the potentiated pdi effect  of chitosan was related to the level of pdi damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. these results indicate that the combination of pdi and chitosan is  quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.

AB  == background: a prototype solid-state ultraviolet-c (uvc) led device may be useful  in the treatment of corneal microbial infections, as uvc is commonly used for eradicating bacteria, fungi and viruses in other settings. this study assessed the efficacy of 265 nm uvc from this led, on four different bacterial strains, and investigated the consequences of corresponding exposures on human corneal epithelial cells in vitro. methods: agar plate lawns of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes were exposed  to a 4.5 mm diameter 265 nm uvc beam at a fixed intensity and distance, for 30, 5, 4, 2 and 1 seconds. growth inhibition was assessed with a biorad gel imager, and the diameter of lucent areas of bacterial inhibition recorded. human corneal  epithelial cells cultured on glass cover-slips were exposed to corresponding doses of uvc from the same device. live/dead staining was performed and the results quantified. results: there was 100% inhibition of growth for all bacteria tested, at all exposure times. a 30-second exposure of human corneal epithelium to uvc gave no statistically significant decrease (p = 0.877) in the ratio of live to dead cells when compared to control cultures. conclusion: the results confirmed that a 1 second exposure to germicidal uvc from this led source was sufficient to inhibit microbial proliferation in the four bacterial strains tested in vitro. the literature suggests uvc at this dose could potentially be beneficial in treating corneal surface infections, without causing significant adverse effects, supported by our findings in human corneal epithelium exposed to uvc.

TI  == identification and characterization of anti-microbial peptides from rabbit vaginal fluid.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) serve as a first line of host defense and represent an important, though poorly understood components of the innate immune system. the present study was an attempt to identify and characterize the major molecules having anti-bacterial activities from the vaginal fluid of rabbit, oryctologus cuniculus. amps from the rabbit vaginal fluid (rvf) were identified in the acid extracts of pooled rvf samples after rp-hplc purification. the protein, rvfamp was effective against gram negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. the results of acid urea-page-gel overlay assay (au-page-goa) demonstrated clear  zone of growth inhibition of e. coli corresponding to 6 and 15 kda protein bands. lc-ms data of these proteins indicated that 15 kda protein consists of lysozyme,  lipopolysaccharide binding protein (lbp), hemoglobin-alpha and beta subunits (hb-alpha/beta), whereas 9 kda protein band consists of transthyretin and calcyclin while uteroglobulin and neutrophil antibacterial peptide-5 (namp-5) are present in the 6 kda protein band. of the eight proteins, hb-alpha derived protein was further characterized, as it showed the highest probability based mowse score (pbms) of 288. a 25mer peptide, rvfhbalphap was active against several clinical pathogens as demonstrated by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and radial diffusion assays (rda). the interaction of rvfhbalphap with bacterial liposome membrane was assessed by calcein dye leakage assay. rvfhbalphap did not show cytotoxicity against human endocervical cells (end1/e6e7) or erythrocytes. rt-pcr and immunofluorescence results revealed the expression of rvfhbalphap mrna and protein in rabbit vaginal tissue. to the best  our knowledge, this is the first report describing the detection of amps in rvfs. in conclusion, these studies indicated that vaginal epithelial cells (vec) derived rvfhbalphap may have therapeutic potential in the management of reproductive well being of rabbits. the major reason for undertaking this study in rabbits is that, it forms an excellent in vivo model system for human's studies.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  == maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. this study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal  bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin  for enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. a range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. the results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on s. aureus. minimal concentrations and mbc of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. the mbc of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against s. aureus were also decreased. the other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. the synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.

TI  == effective photoinactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  using an hiv-1 tat peptide-porphyrin conjugate.
AB  == given that cell-penetrating peptides (cpp) are cationic and often amphipathic, similar to membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, it may be possible to use cpp  conjugation to improve the delivery of photosensitisers for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (antimicrobial pdt). we investigated the possibility of using a tat peptide to deliver the photosensitiser, tetrakis(phenyl)porphyrin (tpp) and kill bacteria. the tat peptide is a positively-charged mammalian cell-penetrating peptide with potent antimicrobial activity but no haemolytic activity. fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the bioconjugate can bind to and/or be incorporated into all bacterial species tested. all species were susceptible to the tat-porphyrin, with the bactericidal effect being dependent on both the concentration and the light dose. using the highest light dose, treatment with the tat-porphyrin achieved reductions of 6.6 log(10) and 6.37 log(10) in the viable counts of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and reductions of 5.74 log(10) and 6.6 log(10) in the viable counts of pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. moreover, the tat moiety appears to  confer antimicrobial properties to the conjugate, particularly for the gram positive strains, based on the observation of dark toxicity using 1 mum of tat-porphyrin. finally, the conjugate induced membrane destabilization by synergistic action of the peptide and pdt, resulting in carboxyfluorescein leakage from bacterial membrane-mimicking liposomes. these findings demonstrate that the use of cpp to deliver a photosensitiser is an effective way of improving the uptake and the treatment efficacy of antimicrobial pdt.

TI  == bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  == non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. the purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. overall, gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than gram-positive bacteria. for the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cenocepacia and escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the sa  78 and atcc 6538 strains, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. a rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with p. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive staphylococcus aureus  strain sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. a 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. a 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated p. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated  animals after the third day of the course. wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.

AB  == the clinical significance of pyran and pyrimidine condensed systems and the raise in problem of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens has directed us to synthesize pyranopyrimidine derivatives via the reactions of the versatile, 2-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4h-substituted chromene-3-carbonitrile with the appropriate reagents. the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by ir, (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr, mass spectra and elemental analysis. the compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antitubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h(37)rv [atcc-27294] and antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus [atcc-25923] and streptococcus pyogenes [mtcc-443] as gram-positive, escherichia coli [atcc-25922] and pseudomonas aeruginosa [mtcc-441] as gram-negative bacterial strains and antifungal activity against aspergillus niger [mtcc-282]. several derivatives exhibited pronounced antitubercular and antimicrobial activities.

TI  == 99mtc-human beta-defensin-3
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi (1). the mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their  structural differences: alpha-defensins, beta-defensins, and theta-defensins. mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal epithelial cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated  from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. recently, two novel human beta-defensins (human beta-defensin-3 (hbd-3) and human beta-defensin-4 (hbd-4))  have been identified. similar to hbd-1 and hbd-2, hbd-3 has microbicidal activity toward the gram-negative bacteria (e.g., pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) and yeasts. in addition, hbd-3 kills gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant s. aureus strains. in contrast to hbd-1 and hbd-2, significant expression of hbd-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues such as leukocytes, heart, and skeletal muscle. hbd-4 is expressed in certain epithelial cells and in neutrophils. a variety of radiolabeled compounds, including 67ga-citrate, 99mtc-ciprofloxacin, 18f-fdg, and 111in- or 99mtc-labeled antibodies that interact with specific receptors on the infiltrating leukocytes, and peptides have been evaluated for the detection of infections (2, 3). however, because they accumulate in both infected and inflamed areas of the body, these radiopharmaceuticals are nonspecific and cannot distinguish between infection and inflammation. in an effort to identify and develop radioactive compounds that are specific for the detection of infections, various investigators have evaluated the use of antimicrobial peptides that are found naturally in most multicellular  organisms (4). such peptides bind specifically to microbes, presumably through cationic domains that interact with anionic regions of the microbial membrane, and have been shown to distinguish infected tissue from inflamed tissue (5). liberatore et al.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical profile of community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
AB  == the aim of our study was to obtain comprehensive insight into the bacteriological and clinical profile of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. the patient population consisted of 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (cap), as defined by british thoracic society, from  december 1998 to dec 2000, at the sher- i-kashmir institute of medical sciences soura, srinagar, india. gram negative organisms were the commonest cause (19/29), followed by gram positive (10/29). in 71 cases no etiological cause was obtained. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen (10/29), followed by staphylococcus aureus (7/29), escherichia coli (6/29), klebsiella spp. (3/29), streptococcus pyogenes (1/29), streptococcus pneumoniae (1/29) and acinetobacter  spp. (1/29). sputum was the most common etiological source of organism isolation  (26) followed by blood (6), pleural fluid (3), and pus culture (1). maximum number of patients presented with cough (99%), fever (95%), tachycardia (92%), pleuritic chest pain (75%), sputum production (65%) and leucocytosis (43%). the commonest predisposing factors were smoking (65%), copd (57%), structural lung disease (21%), diabetes mellitus (13%), and decreased level of consciousness following seizure (eight per cent) and chronic alcoholism (one per cent). fourteen patients, of whom, nine were males and five females, died. staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in four, pseudomonas in two, klebsiella in one, and no organism was isolated in seven cases. the factors predicting mortality at admission were - age over 62 years, history of copd or smoking, hypotension, altered sensorium, respiratory failure, leucocytosis, and staphylococcus pneumonia and undetermined etiology. the overall rate of identification of microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was 29%, which is very low, and if serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses are performed the diagnostic yield would definitely be better. this emphasizes the need for further studies (including the serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses) to identify the microbial etiology of cap.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == [immunization and bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx as risk factors for alopecia areata].
AB  == introduction: alopecia areata is an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the hair follicles. researchers are currently interested in whether the presence of bacterial pathogens and/or a history of immunization can trigger an autoimmune response in patients who are genetically predisposed. objectives: this study aimed to determine whether there is an association between the development of alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or a history of immunization. material and methods: sixty-five men and women with alopecia areata and 65 control patients with other skin diseases were studied at the dr ladislao  de la pascua dermatology clinic between september 2008 and february 2009. the patients ranged in age from 18-59 years. patients with scalp diseases were excluded from the control group. in all cases, the patient was questioned about immunizations received in the previous 6 months, and a throat swab was cultured.  results: a history of immunization (odds ratio [or], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.6-6.7; p=.001), the presence of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx (or, 2.6; 95% ci, 1.1-6.2; p=.033), and being a carrier of streptococcus pyogenes (or, 2.1; 95% ci, 1.7-2.5; p=.042) were risk factors for alopecia areata. klebsiella pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli were isolated from cultures. conclusions: this is the first study to show an association between alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or history of immunization, as  risk factors for development of the disease. given the characteristics of our study population, the association appears valid for patients with less than 25% hair loss and a course of disease under 1 year.

TI  == co-spray-dried mannitol-ciprofloxacin dry powder inhaler formulation for cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the potential of delivering a combination therapy, containing mannitol (a sugar alcohol with osmotic characteristics), and  ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (an antibacterial fluoroquinolone), as a dry powder inhaler (dpi) formulation for inhalation. single and combination powders were produced by spray drying ciprofloxacin and mannitol, from aqueous solution, at different ratios and under controlled conditions, as to obtain similar particle size distributions. each formulation was characterised using laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic vapour sorption, x-ray powder diffraction, and colloidal force microscopy. the in vitro  aerosol performance of each formulation was studied using an aerolizer dpi device and a multi-stage liquid impinger (analysed using high performance liquid chromatography). in addition, a disk diffusion test was performed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of each formulation and starting materials. all formulations had similar particle size distributions, however, the morphology, thermal properties and moisture sorption was dependent on the relative percentages of each component. in general, the combination formulation containing 50% (w/w) mannitol appeared to have the best aerosol performance, good stability  and lowest particle cohesion (as measured by colloid probe microscopy). furthermore, of the formulations tested, mannitol did not appear to alter the effectiveness of the ciprofloxacin antimicrobial activity to staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes. the combination of co-spray-dried mannitol and ciprofloxacin from a dpi is an attractive approach to promote mucous clearance in the respiratory tract while simultaneously treating local chronic infection, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis.

TI  == development of a novel dna microarray to detect bacterial pathogens in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).
AB  == a novel microarray was constructed with dna pcr product probes targeting species  specific functional genes of nine clinically significant respiratory pathogens, including the gram-positive organisms (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes), the gram-negative organisms (chlamydia pneumoniae, coxiella burnetii haemophilus spp., legionella pneumophila, moraxella catarrhalis, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa), as well as the atypical bacterium, mycoplasma pneumoniae. in a "proof-of-concept" evaluation of the developed microarray, the microarray was compared with real-time pcr from 14 sputum specimens from copd patients. all of the samples positive for bacterial species in real-time pcr were also positive for the same bacterial species using the microarray. this study shows that a microarray using pcr probes is a potentially useful method to monitor the populations of bacteria in respiratory specimens and can be tailored to specific  clinical needs such as respiratory infections of particular patient populations,  including patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.

AB  == we have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. in this paper, we report the results of an  analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous  years. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs). the resistance of s. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. most strains of enterobacteriaceae except for escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to fqs. almost 30% of e. coli strains were resistant to fqs and the resistance increased further this year. fqs resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (stfx). fqs resistance of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was low at about 10%. fqs resistance of  methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), but it  was lower than that of mrsa. however, fqs resistance of mscns was higher than that of mssa. fqs resistance of enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for stfx (58.3%). in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, fqs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of p. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend  as in past years. multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. the carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem  at present, accounted for 2.7%. neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to fqs. the results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and n.  gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against fqs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.

TI  == the disruption of bacterial membrane integrity through ros generation induced by  nanohybrids of silver and clay.
AB  == nanohybrids, synthesized via silver nitrate reduction in the presence of silicate clay, exhibit a high potency against bacterial growth. the plate-like clay, due to its anionic surface charges and a large surface area, serves as the support for the formation of silver nanoparticles (agnps) approximately 30 nm in diameter. the nanohybrid consisting of ag/silicate at a 7/93 weight ratio inhibited the growth of dermal pathogens including staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyrogens, as well as the methicillin- and oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa and orsa). scanning electron microscope revealed that these nanohybrids were adherent on the surface of individual bacteria. the thin silicate plates provide a surface for immobilizing  agnps in one highly concentrated area but prevent them from entering the cell membrane. subsequent cytotoxicity studies indicated that surface contact with the reduced agnps on clay is sufficient to initiate cell death. this toxicity is related to a loss in membrane integrity due to reactive oxygen species (ros) generation. the hybridization of agnps on clay surface is viable for generating a new class of nanohybrids exhibiting mild cytotoxicity but high efficacy for battling drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == a study on nosocomial pathogens in icu with special reference to multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  == background & objectives: antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (icu). present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from icu causing nosocomial infections. special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. methods: the clinical specimens obtained  from icu, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. acinetobacter isolates were identified by api2one system. antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by double dilution agar plate method. the plasmid profile of  26 antibiotic resistant isolates of acinetobacter was studied. curing of r-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing a. baumannii isolates. plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. results: major infections found in icu were due to acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. more than 90 per cent isolates of acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. plasmid profile of acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. ethidium bromide cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281, pupi282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. transformation frequency of e. coli hb101 with pupi281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid dna. interpretation & conclusions: a. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. a. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from icu. antibiotic sensitivity of a. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. therefore, it is very important to target acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.

TI  == determination of antibacterial activity of polyenzyme preparations gumseb using in vitro methods.
AB  == a novel polyenzyme formulation gumseb developed by advanced enzyme technologies ltd, thane and speciality biochemicals co., usa, was tested for antibacterial properties using atcc strains and clinical isolates of salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. a modified antibiotic susceptibility test  was used for the purpose. s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were found to  be sensitive to the formulation at the chosen concentration. next, to study the interaction between gumseb and currently used antibiotic, a checkerboard minimum  inhibitory concentrations (mic) was carried out for each organism. the assay was  carried out with the aim of establishing whether the polyenzyme formulation had any potentiating effect on the antibiotic of choice. synergistic effect was established when gumseb was used in conjunction with penicillin against s. pyogenes. partial synergy was established when it was used in conduction with ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa and with ciprofloxacin against methicillin sensitive, coagulase positive s. aureus. antagonism was established when it was used in conjunction with ampicillin against e. coli, with ciprofloxacin against s. typhi and coagulase negative staphylococcal strain. the results indicate that  gumseb can be used in conjunction with those antibiotics with which a synergistic or a partially synergistic effect could be shown, as in the case of p. aerugionosa and s. aureus. these findings have particular importance since these  organisms are responsible for hospital based infections and are notorious for antibiotic resistance. in cases where antagonism was established, it should not be used in combination with that particular antibiotic. however, it can be used individually since it has proved to have antibacterial activity and mic could be  determined for all five commonly encountered pathogens. therefore, it has the potential of being a novel broad range antibacterial drug. these findings are significant given the alarming rise in incidence of antibiotic resistance in most clinically important pathogens.

TI  == mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  == background: the antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. objective: to investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. methods: the activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. the validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. the inhibition zones of the discs were measured. results: mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on e. coli, whereas they had no effects on p. aeruginosa. lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, s. pyogenes and e. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5%  showed no activity on e. faecalis and inhibited s. pyogenes only at double doses. it was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. conclusion: in the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.

TI  == lethal photosensitization of wound-associated microbes using indocyanine green and near-infrared light.
AB  == background: the increase in resistance to antibiotics among disease-causing bacteria necessitates the development of alternative antimicrobial approaches such as the use of light-activated antimicrobial agents (laaas). light of an appropriate wavelength activates the laaa to produce cytotoxic species which can  then cause bacterial cell death via loss of membrane integrity, lipid peroxidation, the inactivation of essential enzymes, and/or exertion of mutagenic effects due to dna modification. in this study, the effect of the laaa indocyanine green excited with high or low intensity light (808 nm) from a near-infrared laser (nir) on the viability of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. results: all  species were susceptible to killing by the laaa, the bactericidal effect being dependent on both the concentration of indocyanine green and the light dose. indocyanine green photosensitization using both high (1.37 w cm(-2)) and low (0.048 w cm(-2)) intensity nir laser light was able to achieve reductions of 5.6  log10 (>99.99%) and 6.8 log10 (>99.99%) in the viable counts of staph. aureus and strep. pyogenes (using starting concentrations of 106-107 cfu ml(-1)). kills of 99.99% were obtained for p. aeruginosa (initial concentration 108-109 cfu ml(-1)) photosensitized by the high intensity light (1.37 w cm(-2)); while a kill of 80%  was achieved using low intensity irradiation (0.07 w cm(-2)). the effects of l-tryptophan (a singlet oxygen scavenger) and deuterium oxide (as an enhancer of  the life span of singlet oxygen) on the survival of staph. aureus was also studied. l-tryptophan reduced the proportion of staph. aureus killed; whereas deuterium oxide increased the proportion killed suggesting that singlet oxygen was involved in the killing of the bacteria. conclusion: these findings imply that indocyanine green in combination with light from a near-infrared laser may be an effective means of eradicating bacteria from wounds and burns.

TI  == changing trends in acute osteomyelitis in children: impact of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == background: staphylococcus aureus remains the most common etiologic agent of acute osteomyelitis in children. recently, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) has emerged as a major pathogen. methods: records of all children admitted with acute osteomyelitis from january 1999 to december 2003 were reviewed. for the comparative analysis, the study population was evenly distributed in 2 periods: period a, january 1999 to june 2001; n = 113; and period b, july 2001 to december 2003; n = 177. in addition, clinical findings of mrsa osteomyelitis were compared with non-mrsa osteomyelitis, including methicillin-sensitive s. aureus infections. results: two hundred ninety children (60% male subjects) with acute osteomyelitis were identified. median (25th-75th percentile) age at diagnosis was 6 years (range, 2-11 years). significant clinical findings included the following: localized pain (84%), fever (67%), and swelling (62%). affected bones  included the following: foot (23%), femur (20%), tibia (16%), and pelvis (7%). thirty-seven percent of blood cultures were positive, and a bacterial isolate was obtained in 55% of cases. bacteria most frequently isolated included the following: methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (45%) (57% in period avs 40% in period b), mrsa (23%) (6% in a vs 31% in b; p < 0.001), streptococcus pyogenes (6%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%). children with mrsa compared with those with non-mrsa osteomyelitis had significantly greater erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein values on admission and increased length of hospital stay, antibiotic therapy, and overall rate of complications. we observed significant changes in antibiotic therapy related to increased use of agents with activity against mrsa. conclusions: methicillin-resistant s. aureus was isolated more frequently in the second study period and was associated with worse clinical outcomes.

TI  == in vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of ketamine.
AB  == background: antibacterial activity of local anesthetics especially lidocaine has  been shown previously. in this study, the antibacterial effect of ketamine, a general anesthetic agent was investigated. methods: the antibacterial effect of ketamine was studied using six different strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, entecoccus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli) with disc diffusion method. ciprofloxacine discs (cip, oxoid) were used as a control to verify the methodology. minimal inhibition concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) of ketamine for these bacteria were also determined. results: no inhibition was evident in discs containing 62.5 microg of ketamine. ketamine 125 microg showed activity on all the bacteria tested with the exception of e. coli. the inhibition rates of ketamine were more prominent at the doses of 250 microg and 500 microg similar to the inhibition rate of cip. whereas mic and mbc  values of ketamine for s. aureus and s. pyogenes were 500 microg ml(-1), mic and  mbc values for p. aeruginosa were above 2000 microg ml(-1). for other bacteria, these values ranged between these levels. conclusions: ketamine with higher doses showed antibacterial activity. we thought that it will be proper to use ketamine  hesitantly in experimental animal studies like sepsis and translocation.

TI  == associated antimicrobial resistance in escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == associated resistance to four to six related and unrelated antimicrobial agents was investigated in consecutive non-duplicate isolates of escherichia coli (n = 39 425), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1070), staphylococcus aureus (n = 7489), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1604) and streptococcus pyogenes (n = 2531). in all species, high proportions (76.5-88.9%) of isolates were susceptible to all the drugs investigated. irrespective of species, isolates resistant to one drug were  more likely to be resistant to any of the other drugs than were susceptible isolates. thus, trimethoprim resistance in e. coli was 38.4% among ampicillin-resistant vs. 3.9% among ampicillin-susceptible isolates, and erythromycin resistance in strep. pneumoniae was 41% among doxycycline-resistant  vs. 1% among doxycycline-susceptible isolates. in all five species investigated,  there was also significant associated resistance among unrelated drugs, highlighting the fact that resistance development occurs primarily among bacteria already resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. for the clinician, pronounced resistance associations mean that when empirical therapy fails because of resistance, there is a reduced chance of choosing an alternative successful empirical agent. for the epidemiologist, who uses routine clinical susceptibility data to describe resistance development, resistance associations mean that if the dataset contains results for isolates selected on the basis of their susceptibility to another drug, structurally related or not, a bias of false resistance is introduced.

TI  == necrotizing fasciitis in children: diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.
AB  == background: necrotizing fasciitis (nf) is a severe life-threatening soft tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading necrosis of the fascia and the subcutaneous tissue. its incidence owing to invasive streptococcus pyogenes has significantly increased in children recently. our experience with nf in children  to describe diagnostic and therapeutic aspects is hence presented herein. methods: records of children who were treated for nf in our unit from 1999 to 2006, inclusive, were reviewed retrospectively. information recorded for each patient included medical history, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatment methods, and the outcome. results: thirteen patients with a mean age of 35 months were treated for nf during the study period. all of the 13  children had no previous immunosuppression. the predisposing factors were composed of varicella lesions, intramuscular injections, application of a cream containing menthol to the cervical region, penetrant gluteal trauma, omphalitis,  dental abscess, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. the most common site of the initial involvement was the abdominal wall, followed by the gluteal region and thigh, head and neck, and upper and lower extremities. the initial skin presentations were induration or cellulitis and erythema and edema with progression to skin discoloration and bullae formation. fever and tachycardia were the most common clinical features. s. pyogenes was the most common causative microorganism, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all patients underwent extensive surgical debridement and received appropriate antibiotics and supportive therapy. twelve patients survived, and 1 patient with  delayed diagnosis of nf died of septic shock. conclusion: although these infections are rare in children, their lethal potential and early diagnostic signs must be recognized. all children with nf should undergo early surgical debridement to prevent delay in treatment. the mortality and morbidity associated with nf in children can be decreased with clinical awareness, early diagnosis, and adequate and urgent surgical debridement followed by intensive supportive care and early wound resurfacing.

TI  == cospray dried antibiotics for dry powder lung delivery.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the potential of delivering a combination antibiotic therapy, containing doxycycline and ciprofloxacin (both hydrochloride) as a dry powder (dpi) formulation for inhalation. single and combination antibiotics were produced by spray drying. particle size distributions were characterized by laser diffraction and imaging conducted by scanning electron microscopy. solid-state characterisation of the antibiotics was carried out using differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic vapour sorption, x-ray powder diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry. using the aerolizer device, the aerosol performance was measured using multistage liquid impinger and analysed using high performance liquid chromatography (r(2) = 1.0, cv = 0.4-1.0%). furthermore, a disk diffusion test was performed for the assessment of the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the raw and spray dried antibiotics against bacteria. results showed that cospray drying of the ciprofloxacin and doxycycline produced an antibiotic formulation (in a 1:1 ratio) suitable for inhalation that showed to be physically more stable then the analogous single spray dried antibiotic. the cospray dried powder has improved dispersion over the less stable single spray dried ciprofloxacin. the spray dried antibiotics were observed to have similar antimicrobial activity to the original antibiotics for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyrogenes, suggesting the spray drying process does not affect the anti-bacterial activity of the drug. cospray dried antibiotics from a dpi is thus feasible and can potentially be an attractive delivery alternative to the more conventional systemic delivery route.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (actichelated propolis).
AB  == aims: this study compared in vitro activities of actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. methods and results: minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater  potency of actichelated propolis (mic range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (mic range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). concentrations of actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. preincubation of strep. pyogenes and h. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x mic) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. conclusions: actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells.  significance and impact of the study: this new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.

TI  == effects of av119, a natural sugar from avocado, on malassezia furfur invasiveness and on the expression of hbd-2 and cytokines in human keratinocytes.
AB  == av119 is a patented blend of two sugars from avocado that can induce human beta-defensin-2 production by normal human keratinocytes. in this study, we analysed the effect of av119 on growth and invasiveness of malassezia furfur, a dimorphic, lipid-dependent yeast that is part of the normal human cutaneous commensal flora. the ability to modulate the expression of the proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines in normal human keratinocytes was also investigated. microbiological assay demonstrated that this sugar induced the aggregation of yeast cells and inhibited the invasiveness of m. furfur, without affecting its growth. real-time pcr analysis demonstrated that av119 was able to  modulate the hbd-2 response in treated keratinocytes, reaching a maximum after 48-h treatment, and to induce the recovery of a satisfactory proinflammatory response in human keratinocytes. as av119 can induce aggregation of yeast cells,  thus inhibiting their penetration into the keratinocytes, the sugar could be used in the preparation of cosmetics or pharmacological drugs to inhibit colonization  of the skin by pathogenic strains of m. furfur.

TI  == a silkworm model of pathogenic bacterial infection.
AB  == silkworms are invertebrate animals that are killed by bacteria pathogenic against humans, such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae. injection into the hemolymph of antibiotics that are clinically used for human patients abolishes the killing effects. there are several advantages to using silkworms as an infection model, such as low cost, the absence of ethical problems that are associated with the use of mammals, and  a body size large enough to handle while injecting sample solution into the hemolymph. we screened s. aureus mutants with attenuated virulence against silkworms and found three novel virulence regulatory genes, cvfa, cvfb, and cvfc. these genes contribute to virulence against mice and are required for exotoxin production. the cvfa gene is required for expression of the agr locus, which regulates most exotoxin genes, and a novel dna binding protein sarz. silkworms are susceptible to s. aureus beta toxin, p. aeruginosa exotoxin a, and diphtheria toxin. therefore, silkworms are a promising infection model animal for the identification and evaluation of virulenceassociated genes.

TI  == triphala promotes healing of infected full-thickness dermal wound.
AB  == background: infection is a major problem in the management of wounds. even though the development of synthetic antimicrobial agents persists, drug resistance and toxicity hinder their way. many plants with multi-potent pharmaceutical activities may offer better treatment options, and triphala (dried fruits of terminalia chebula, terminalia bellirica, and phyllanthus emblica) are potential  formulations evaluated for healing activity on infected wound as it possesses numerous activities. materials and methods: alcoholic extract of triphala has shown in vitro antimicrobial activity against wound pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes. an ointment was prepared from the triphala extract (10% w/w) and assessed for in vivo wound healing on infected rat model by rate of healing, bacterial count, biochemical analysis, and expression of matrix metalloproteinases. results: the treated group has shown significantly improved wound closure. assessment of granulation tissue on every fourth day showed significant reduction in bacterial  count with significant level of collagen, hexosamine, uronic acid, and superoxide dismutase in the treated group (p < 0.01). reduction of matrix metalloproteinase  expression observed in the treated group by gelatin zymography and immunoblotting confirms our in vivo assessment. conclusions: the above results showed the antibacterial, wound healing, and antioxidant activities of triphala ointment, necessary for the management of infected wounds. active principles of the triphala may be further evaluated and used as an excellent therapeutic formulation for infected wounds.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == [in vitro study to evaluate the antibacterial activity of a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (tropaeoli majoris herba) and of the roots of horseradish (armoraciae rusticanae radix)].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in-vitro antimicrobial properties of a commercialized  preparation (angocin anti-infekt n) containing a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (tropaeoli majoris herba; n) and of the roots of horseradish (armoraciae rusticanae radix; h). this preparation can be used to treat upper respiratory tract (urti) and urinary tract infections (uti). the active ingredients are volatile mustard oils, which are activated in the gastrointestinal tract after oral intake. previous research has shown mustard oils derived from either n or h to possess antibacterial activity. methods: in order to assess the antimicrobial capacity of phytotherapeutic compounds containing volatile mustard oils, a modified gas-test was used. native preparations of n and h were applied to the lids of columbia agar plates (ratio n:h = 2.5:1) and mixed with sterile h20. thirteen different bacterial species including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa, mrsa) were tested (20 isolates each). the  test organisms were plated onto the blood agar plates and placed above the native preparations. the plates were sealed with adhesive tape and incubated at 37 degrees c. following incubation of 24 h and 92 h, colony forming units (cfu) were counted and the minimal inhibitory concentrationg (mic90) was determined for each bacterial species. results: relevant antimicrobial activities of the combined native preparations were found against h. influenzae (mic90 50 mg n / 20 mg h), m. catarrhalis (100 mg n / 40 mg h), e. coli (400 mg n / 160 mg h), p aeruginosa  (400 mg n / 160 mg h), mssa (400 mg n 1 160 mg h), mrsa (400 mg n / 160 mg h), and s. pyogenes (400 mg n / 160 mg h). conclusion: antimicrobial testing of a combination of n and h revealed broad antibacterial activities against clinically relevant pathogens covering both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, thus  confirming previous reports of the antibacterial properties of mustard oils. additionally, this study demonstrated that the combination of n and h leads to synergistic activity in terms of improved pseudomonas-susceptibility compared to  the previous reported activities of the single compounds. thus, these results prove that there is a rational basis for treatment of urti and uti with a combination of n and h.

TI  == secreted bacterial phospholipase a2 enzymes: better living through phospholipolysis.
AB  == phospholipases are ubiquitous and diverse enzymes that induce changes in membrane composition, activate the inflammatory cascade and alter cell signaling pathways. recent evidence suggests that certain bacterial pathogens have acquired genes encoding secreted phospholipase a2 enzymes through lateral gene transfer events.  the two best-studied members of this class of enzyme are exou and slaa, which are produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa and group a streptococcus, respectively. these enzymes modulate the host inflammatory response, increase the severity of disease and otherwise alter host-pathogen interactions. we propose that a key function of exou and slaa is to increase the fitness of the subclones expressing these enzymes, thereby increasing the population size of the pla2-positive strains and  enhancing the likelihood of encountering an at-risk host.

AB  == if a tissue biopsy from a chronic wound is sampled for culture, the antibacterial properties of local anesthetics may pose a problem in producing false-negative results. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of emla (astrazeneca) and lidocaine on common wound pathogenic bacteria. an in vitro study of a total of 25 clinical isolates and atcc reference strains of staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes was conducted. the isolates were exposed to the local anesthetic drugs (and some of their contents separately) at 35 degrees c over a 24-hour period and time-kill curves were recorded. no culture media were used and saline was used for controls. emla was found to have a rapid acting and powerful antibacterial effect and should not be  used before culturing tissue samples. lidocaine 1% was found not to inhibit the bacterial strains when exposure time was held below 2 hours. we conclude that culturing tissue from a wound biopsy is safe within 2 hours when a pure, preservative-free lidocaine 1% solution is used.

AB  == background: inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. methods: the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions. in addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard  textbooks on the topic were reviewed. all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were  included. results: most gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. (including vre), staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), or streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. many gram-negative species, such as acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or shigella spp., can also survive for months. a few others, such as bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, proteus vulgaris, or vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. mycobacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. persistence of other yeasts, such as torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (candida parapsilosis, 14 days). most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, sars or rhino virus, can persist on  surfaces for a few days. viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, hav, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. blood-borne viruses, such as hbv or hiv, can persist for more than one week. herpes viruses, such as cmv or hsv type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from  only a few hours up to 7 days. conclusion: the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.

TI  == the role of anaerobic bacteria in acute and chronic mastoiditis.
AB  == mastoiditis (m) is the most common intratemporal complication of otitis media. the incidence of m has decreased since the advent of antimicrobial agents. in the last decade, however, there has been a marked increased in the incidence of acute m in several communities, sometimes in association with the growing resistance of pneumococci. streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and haemophillus influenzae are the most common organisms recovered in acute m. several recent studies demonstrated the predominance of pseudomonas aeruginosa in this infection. however, because p. aeruginosa colonizes the ear canal it can contaminate specimens obtained through the non-sterile ear canal. p. aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae, s. aureus and anaerobic bacteria are the most common isolates in chronic m. anaerobes predominate in studies where adequate methods for their isolation are employed. management of uncomplicated m requires  the administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tube placement. if no improvement occurs within 48 h, surgical intervention and drainage may be necessary. the procedure generally employed is simple mastoidectomy, and tympanostomy tube placement. radical mastoidectomy is performed only if there is no improvement after simple mastoidectomy.

TI  == universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  == the diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. nested-pcr for universal bacterial dna segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. this method is based on amplification of the 16s bacterial ribosomal rna coding sequences. 11 species  of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus  mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. all could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.

TI  == protease-stable polycationic photosensitizer conjugates between polyethyleneimine and chlorin(e6) for broad-spectrum antimicrobial photoinactivation.
AB  == we previously showed that covalent conjugates between poly-l-lysine and chlorin(e6) were efficient photosensitizers (ps) of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the polycationic molecular constructs increased binding and penetration of the ps into impermeable gram-negative cells. we have now prepared a novel set of second-generation polycationic conjugates between chlorin(e6) and three molecular forms of polyethyleneimine (pei): a small linear, a small cross-linked, and a large cross-linked molecule. the conjugates were characterized by high-pressure liquid chromatography and tested for their ability to kill a panel of pathogenic microorganisms, the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, the gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the yeast candida albicans, after exposure to low levels of red light. the large cross-linked molecule efficiently killed all organisms, while the linear conjugate killed gram-positive bacteria and c. albicans. the small cross-linked conjugate was the least efficient antimicrobial  ps and its remarkably low activity could not be explained by reduced photochemical quantum yield or reduced cellular uptake. in contrast to polylysine conjugates, the pei conjugates were resistant to degradation by proteases such as trypsin that hydrolyze lysine-lysine peptide bonds, the advantage of protease stability combined with the ready availability of pei suggests these molecules may be superior to polylysine-ps conjugates for photodynamic therapy of localized infections.

TI  == susceptibility studies of piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == susceptibility testing was used to evaluate potential spectrum of action for piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and to evaluate dimers against fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci. individual dimers displayed  equivalent or lowered mic values compared with parent fluoroquinolone monomers against test strains of s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. coli, and vre. raised mic  values were observed for all dimers in comparison to monomers against test strains of p. aeruginosa and e. coli. in comparison to parent fluoroquinolones, all dimers displayed decreased percent inhibition of growth against m. tuberculosis. structural requirements for activity of dimers and partial dimers against all organisms, including lower mics against certain fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci, were consistent with requirements previously observed for dimers against fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus. in contrast, the 10- to 100-fold lowering of mics against wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus previously observed for individual cross-linked dimers was not observed with test strains of the various organisms used here.

TI  == tlr4-dependent hepcidin expression by myeloid cells in response to bacterial pathogens.
AB  == hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide secreted by the liver during inflammation that plays a central role in mammalian iron homeostasis. here we demonstrate the  endogenous expression of hepcidin by macrophages and neutrophils in vitro and in  vivo. these myeloid cell types produced hepcidin in response to bacterial pathogens in a toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-dependent fashion. conversely, bacterial stimulation of macrophages triggered a tlr4-dependent reduction in the  iron exporter ferroportin. in vivo, intraperitoneal challenge with pseudomonas aeruginosa induced tlr4-dependent hepcidin expression and iron deposition in splenic macrophages, findings mirrored in subcutaneous infection with group a streptococcus where hepcidin induction was further observed in neutrophils migrating to the tissue site of infection. hepcidin expression in cultured hepatocytes or in the livers of mice infected with bacteria was independent of tlr4, suggesting the tlr4-hepcidin pathway is restricted to myeloid cell types. our findings identify endogenous myeloid cell hepcidin production as a previously unrecognized component of the host response to bacterial pathogens.

AB  == propolis ethanolic solutions are the most used propolis products on the market for the treatment of minor ulcers in the mouth, angina, thrush or skin infections. since it is still an unofficial drug in pharmacy, we analyzed the contents of flavonoids in ten commercially available ethanolic solutions of propolis from the croatian market using two complementary colorimetric methods. antimicrobial activities, determined with the diffusion method, against six bacterial species (bacillus subtilis nctc 8236, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, streptococcus pyogenes atcc 12204, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, escherichia  coli atcc 10536, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and one yeast-like fungus candida albicans atcc 10231 were compared. results of flavonoids analysis suggested that the contents of flavones and flavonols in the products were uniform and ranged from 0.14 to 0.41%, but the content of flavanones varied greatly from 0.43 to 18.78%. total flavonoid content, as the sum of two colorimetric methods, in propolis products was between 0.78 and 18.92%, and most  products had the flavonoids content below 9%. all products with the total flavonoids content above 1% showed antimicrobial activity against the four gram-positive bacterial species tested, and against p. aeruginosa and the yeast-like fungus c. albicans. total flavonoids contents, expressed as the sum of two colorimetric methods, could be useful methods for estimating the flavonoid contents of propolis products. our results indicate that the quality of commercially available propolis products requires verification.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

AB  == objective: to determine the spectrum of the pathogens cultured from surgical wound infections and assess their antimicrobial drug resistances. design: laboratory-based retrospective study for the five year period. setting: a four hundred bed, tertiary-care university hospital in turkey. results: overall 621 pathogens were identified from january 1999 to january 2004. of these isolates, 431 (69%) were gram-positive, 178 (29%) were gram-negative bacteria and also 12 (2%) were identified as candida albicans. the most common organism was staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by escherichia coli (8%), streptococcus pyogenes (7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6%), enterococcus faecalis (4%), enterobacter spp. (4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), acinetobacter spp. (3%), proteus spp. (3%), group b. b-haemolytic streptococci (2%), candida albicans (2%), and citrobacter spp. (1%). the rate of  resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and multidrug resistance in s. aureus  were 31% and 12%, respectively. there was no increase in resistance to methicillin by years. piperacillin/tazobactam, sefoperazone/sulbactam, carbapenems, ofloxacin and amikacin were the most active agents against gram-negative isolates. the rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production  in k. pneumoniae and e. coli strains were determined as 14%, and 6%, respectively. conclusion: methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is emerging as a major pathogen in surgical wound infections. we concluded that antimicrobial treatment of surgical wound infections should include empiric coverage for mrsa. the surveillance of resistance in pathogens causing surgical wound infections is necessary to promote the appropriate therapeutic choices for  these infections.

TI  == cloning, characterization and expression of escapin, a broadly antimicrobial fad-containing l-amino acid oxidase from ink of the sea hare aplysia californica.
AB  == a 60 kda monomeric protein isolated from the defensive purple ink secretion of the sea hare aplysia californica was cloned and sequenced, and is the first sea hare antimicrobial protein to be functionally expressed in e. coli. sequence analysis suggested that this protein is a flavin-containing l-amino acid oxidase  (laao), with one predicted potential glycosylation site, although the glycosylation could not be experimentally confirmed. this protein, which we call  ;escapin', has high sequence similarity to several other gastropod proteins. escapin was verified by nmr, mass spectroscopy and hplc to have fad as its flavin cofactor. escapin's antimicrobial effects, bacteriostasis and bactericidal, were  determined using a combination of two assays: (1) incubation of bacteria on solid media followed by assessment of inhibition by direct observation of zones of inhibition or by turbidity measurements; and (2) incubation of bacteria in liquid media followed by counting viable colonies after growing on agar plates. native escapin inhibited the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including marine bacteria (vibrio harveyii and staphylococcus aureus) and pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa). escapin also inhibited the growth of yeast and fungi, with different efficacies. escapin's antimicrobial activity was concentration dependent and did not decrease when stored for more than 5 months at room temperature. escapin was bacteriostatic and not bactericidal in minimal media (e.g. salt media) with glucose, yeast extract, and a mixture of 20 amino acids each at 50 micromol l(-1), but was bactericidal in media enriched with tryptone peptone. escapin was also strongly bactericidal in media with l-lysine at concentrations as low as 3 mmol l(-1) and slightly bactericidal in 50 mmol l(-1)  l-arginine, but not in most other amino acids even at 50 mmol l(-1). escapin had  high oxidase activity (producing hydrogen peroxide) with either l-arginine or l-lysine as a substrate and little to no oxidase activity with other l-amino acids. hydrogen peroxide alone (without escapin or amino acids) was strongly bacteriostatic but poorly bactericidal, similar in this respect to l-arginine but different from l-lysine in the presence of escapin. together these results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms to escapin's antimicrobial effects, with bacteriostasis resulting largely or entirely from the effects of hydrogen peroxide produced by escapin's laao activity, but bactericidal effects resulting  from lysine-dependent mechanisms not directly involving hydrogen peroxide. recombinant escapin expressed in bacteria was also active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for antimicrobial activity.

TI  == structure-function characterization and optimization of a plant-derived antibacterial peptide.
AB  == crushed seeds of the moringa oleifera tree have been used traditionally as natural flocculants to clarify drinking water. we previously showed that one of the seed peptides mediates both the sedimentation of suspended particles such as  bacterial cells and a direct bactericidal activity, raising the possibility that  the two activities might be related. in this study, the conformational modeling of the peptide was coupled to a functional analysis of synthetic derivatives. this indicated that partly overlapping structural determinants mediate the sedimentation and antibacterial activities. sedimentation requires a positively charged, glutamine-rich portion of the peptide that aggregates bacterial cells. the bactericidal activity was localized to a sequence prone to form a helix-loop-helix structural motif. amino acid substitution showed that the bactericidal activity requires hydrophobic proline residues within the protruding loop. vital dye staining indicated that treatment with peptides containing this motif results in bacterial membrane damage. assembly of multiple copies of this structural motif into a branched peptide enhanced antibacterial activity, since low concentrations effectively kill bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes without displaying a toxic effect on human red blood cells. this study thus identifies a synthetic peptide with potent antibacterial activity against specific human pathogens. it also suggests partly distinct molecular mechanisms for each activity. sedimentation may result from coupled flocculation and coagulation effects, while the bactericidal activity would require bacterial membrane destabilization by a hydrophobic loop.

TI  == analysis of 5' utr composition and gene expression: canonical versus non-canonical start codons.
AB  == the overall composition upstream of start codons in escherichia coli was evaluated and viewed in connection with global transcriptome data. genes starting with aug as initiation codon tended to be expressed at higher levels than the non-aug genes, and the upstream region of the non-aug genes showed negligible signs of shine-dalgarno sequences. the latter is in sharp contrast to the aug genes. viewing these findings in connection with the current literature, it is proposed that a distinct mechanism for initiation of translation might exist for  non-aug genes that are not preceded by a shine-dalgarno sequence. a survey covering a range of other eubacteria (firmicutes, proteoacteria, and actinobacteria) reveals that it is mainly among the proteobacteria that non-aug genes do not display clear signs of shine-dalgarno regions.

TI  == human defensins.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi. the eukaryotic  antimicrobial peptides may be divided into four distinct groups according to their structural features: cysteine-free alpha-helices, extended cysteine-free alpha-helices with a predominance of one or two amino acids, loop structures with one intramolecular disulfide bond, and beta-sheet structures which are stabilised by two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds. mammalian defensins are part of the last-mentioned group. the mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: the alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and the recently described theta-defensins. mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal paneth cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. recently, two novel human beta-defensins, human  beta-defensin-3 (hbd-3), and human beta-defensin-4 (hbd-4) have been discovered.  similar to hbd-1 and hbd-2, hbd-3 has microbicidal activity towards the gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) and the yeasts  candida albicans and malassezia furfur. in addition, hbd-3 kills gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant s. aureus strains, and even vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. in contrast to hbd-1 and hbd-2, significant expression of hbd-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, such as leukocytes, heart and skeletal muscle. hbd-4 is expressed in certain epithelia and in neutrophils. its bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa is stronger than that of the other known beta-defensins. here we present an overview of human antimicrobial peptides with some emphasis on their antifungal properties.

TI  == chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == augmentation of the bactericidal activities of human cathelicidin cap18/ll-37-derived antimicrobial peptides by amino acid substitutions.
AB  == objective: mammalian myeloid and epithelial cells express various peptide antibiotics (such as defensins and cathelicidins) that contribute to the innate host defense against invading micro-organisms. among these, human cathelicidin cap18/ll-37 (l1-s37) possesses potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, to develop peptide derivatives with improved bactericidal actions, we utilized the amphipathic 18-mer peptide (k15-v32) of ll-37 as a template, and evaluated the activities of  modified peptides. methods: antibacterial activities of the peptides (0.022 approximately 4.4 microm corresponding to 0.1 approximately 10 microg/ml) were assessed by alamarblue assay using staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa as target organisms. furthermore, the membrane-permeabilization activities of the peptides were examined by using e. coli ml-35p as a target. results: by substituting e16 and k25 with two l residues, the hydrophobicity of the peptide (18-mer ll) was increased, and by further substituting q22, d26 and n30 with three k residues, the cationicity of the peptide (18-mer llkkk) was enhanced. among peptide derivatives, 18-mer llkkk exhibited the most potent antibacterial actions against s. aureus (methicillin-resistant and -sensitive), s. pneumoniae,  s. pyogenes, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, and possessed the most powerful membrane-permeabilizing activities against e. coli ml-35p at the effective concentrations (p <0.05, 18-mer llkkk vs. 18-mer ll, 18-mer k15-v32 and ll-37). conclusions: bactericidal activities of the amphipathic human cap18/ll-37-derived 18-mer peptide can be augmented by modifying its hydrophobicity and cationicity,  and 18-mer llkkk is the most potent among peptide derivatives with therapeutic potential for gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.

AB  == background: skin and soft tissue infections remain among the most frequently encountered infections in surgery, and their severity ranges from mild cellulitis to severe, necrotizing infections with high incidences of morbidity and mortality. most commonly, these disorders result from skin lesions in a susceptible host, but sometimes develop following hematogenous spread from a previously unknown focus. methods: the current literature was reviewed to provide an up-to-date summary of the microbiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and therapy of complicated skin and soft tissue infections. special conditions are also described, such as cellulitis, bite wounds and diabetic foot infections. the potential roles of several new drugs that have become available recently, or are  currently in phase iii clinical trials, are discussed. results: the causative pathogens are mostly gram-positive cocci from a patient's endogenous skin flora,  but complicated infections often involve gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria related to the site and source of infection. classifications are numerous and often confusing, occasionally leading to a prolonged diagnostic workup. therapy should be initiated immediately following clinical diagnosis, including empiric antimicrobial chemotherapy and surgical debridement, if necessary. hospitalization is mandatory for those patients with constitutional symptoms of sepsis, failed outpatient therapy, or deeper infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis. the number and variety of resistant organisms in the community continues to increase steadily, with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) currently the most common. several new drugs that are active against mrsa  are becoming available, and include those active broadly against gram-positive cocci, such as quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin. tigecycline, a new antibiotic of the glycylcycline class, has extended broad-spectrum activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including anaerobes and multi-resistant organisms. conclusions: new, promising agents, with activity against multi-drug resistant gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, are aimed at filling the gap in the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections.

TI  == activation of the complement system generates antibacterial peptides.
AB  == the complement system represents an evolutionary old and significant part of the  innate immune system involved in protection against invading microorganisms. here, we show that the anaphylatoxin c3a and its inactivated derivative c3a-desarg are antibacterial, demonstrating a previously unknown direct antimicrobial effect of complement activation. the c3a peptide, as well as functional epitopes in the sequence, efficiently killed the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. in mice, a c3a-derived peptide suppressed infection by gram-positive streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. fluorescence and electron microscopy demonstrated that c3a binds to and induces breaks in bacterial membranes. c3a was also found to induce membrane leakage of liposomes. these findings provide an interesting link between the complement system and antimicrobial peptides, which are two important branches of innate immunity.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == survival and surface adherence ability of bacterial pathogens in oral liquid pharmaceuticals and their containers.
AB  == the survival and surface adherence ability of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in nutrient broth and in five oral liquid pharmaceuticals (nivaquine syrup, cough mixture, paracetamol elixir, cotrimoxazole and vitamin c) were investigated the bacteria grew more in nutrient broth than in the pharmaceuticals (p < 0. 001) and the recovery of stressed cells was enhanced when 3% tween 80 was used as the recovery medium as against the use of normal saline (p < 0.01). the gram-negative bacteria were more adapted to the pharmaceuticals than their gram-positive counterparts. klebsiella pneumoniae and ps. aeruginosa were recovered in large numbers from nivaquine and cotrimoxazole suspensions that did  not support the growth of the other bacteria. the effect of bacterial growth on the physico-chemical properties of the pharmaceuticals was also evaluated the properties were not altered significantly except for ph shifts of 0.3 to 1.1 caused by e. coli and s. aureus in paracetamol and vitamin c. adherence capability was found to correlate with the survival ability of the bacteria. populations on coupons were significantly higher when nutrient broth was used as  the suspending medium compared with any of the pharmaceuticals (p < 0.01). rubber and plastic coupons were significantly more accessible to the bacteria than glass coupon as revealed by the high population of bacteria recovered from their surfaces.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

(sterculiaceae), uapaca togoensis pax. (euphorbiaceae), ximenia americana l. (olacaceae), khaya senegalensis (ders.) a. juss. (meliaceae), lannea acida a.  rich. (anacardiaceae), cissus populnea guill. & perr. (vitaceae), keetia hispida  (benth.) bridson (rubiaceae) and ficus thonningii (miq.) a. rich. (moraceae). this is the first report of the antibacterial potency of these 10 plant species on a range of bacteria. the results provided evidence that some of the studied plants might indeed be potential sources of new antibacterial agents, also against some antibiotic-resistant strains.

AB  == we investigated the bacterial flora present in skin lesions of patients with chiclero's ulcer from the yucatan peninsula of mexico using conventional culture  methods (11 patients), and an immunocolorimetric detection of pathogenic streptococcus pyogenes (15 patients). prevalence of bacteria isolated by culture  methods was 90.9% (10/11). we cultured, from chiclero's ulcers (60%), pathogenic  bacterial such as staphylococcus aureus (20%), s. pyogenes (1.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.6%), morganella morganii (1.6%), and opportunist pathogenic bacteria such as klebsiella spp. (20.0%), enterobacter spp. (20%), and enterococcus spp. (20%). we also cultured coagulase-negative staphylococci in 40% (4/10) of the remaining patients. micrococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci constituted the bacterial genuses more frequently isolated in the normal skin of patients with chiclero's ulcer and healthy individuals used as controls. we also undertook another study to find out the presence of s. pyogenes by an immunocolorimetric assay. this study indicated that 60% (9/15) of the ulcerated lesions, but not normal controls, were contaminated with s. pyogenes. importantly, individuals with purulent secretion and holding concomitant infections with s. pyogenes, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, m. morganii, and e. durans took longer to heal leishmania (l.) mexicana infections treated with antimonial drugs. our results suggest the need to eliminate bacterial purulent infections, by antibiotic treatment, before starting antimonial administration to patients with chiclero's ulcer.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == bacterial responses to neutrophil phagocytosis.
AB  == purpose of review: this review focuses on adaptive bacterial interactions with neutrophils, emphasizing information communicated within the past year about bacterial factors that respond to contact with or phagocytosis by pmn. recent findings: since the discovery of type iii and iv secretion, progress in the analysis of bacterial interactions with host phagocytes has been extensive but largely focused on the macrophage. the remarkable growth of information about bacterial subversion of macrophage metabolism has been summarized in several excellent reviews. the scope of progress on neutrophil-bacteria interactions is more limited and dominated by recent studies of the granulocyte pathogen, anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis. summary: for many pathogens, contact with or ingestion by phagocytes elicits a vigorous but varied microbial response. the response repertoire includes activation of type iii and type iv secretion systems that inject effector molecules into the host cell. effectors modify host cell signaling and metabolic pathways to favor survival of the microbe. whereas microbial secretory structures are few in kind and relatively conserved, effector molecules are numerous and variable. effectors may promote phagocytosis by nonphagocytic cells or suppress phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. they may suppress assembly or misdirect localization of the phagocyte nadph oxidase that is responsible for generating toxic oxidants, and they may suppress phagosome-lysosome fusion. phagocytosed bacteria may also up-regulate the expression of defensive proteins that attenuate the effects of phagocyte-derived antimicrobial toxins. these pathogenic stratagems probably have their origins in the competition among single-celled organisms, eukaryotes versus prokaryotes, that arose early in evolution.

TI  == acylation of sc4 dodecapeptide increases bactericidal potency against gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains.
AB  == we have conjugated dodecyl and octadecyl fatty acids to the n-terminus of sc4, a  potently bactericidal, helix-forming peptide 12-mer (klfkrhlkwkii), and examined  the bactericidal activities of the resultant sc4 'peptide-amphiphile' molecules.  sc4 peptide-amphiphiles showed up to a 30-fold increase in bactericidal activity  against gram-positive strains (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and  bacillus anthracis), including s. aureus strains resistant to conventional antibiotics, but little or no increase in bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa). fatty acid  conjugation improved endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) neutralization by 3- to 6-fold. although acylation somewhat increased lysis of human erythrocytes, it did not increase lysis of endothelial cells, and the haemolytic effects occurred at concentrations 10- to 100-fold higher than those required for bacterial cell lysis. for insight into the mechanism of action of sc4 peptide-amphiphiles, cd, nmr and fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed in micelle and liposome  models of eukaryotic and bacterial cell membranes. cd indicated that sc4 peptide-amphiphiles had the strongest helical tendencies in liposomes mimicking bacterial membranes, and strong membrane integration of the sc4 peptide-amphiphiles was observed using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy under these conditions; results that correlated with the increased bactericidal activities of sc4 peptide-amphiphiles. nmr structural analysis in micelles demonstrated that the two-thirds of the peptide closest to the fatty acid tail exhibited a helical conformation, with the positively-charged side of the amphipathic helix interacting more with the model membrane surface. these results indicate that conjugation of a fatty acid chain to the sc4 peptide enhances membrane interactions, stabilizes helical structure in the membrane-bound state and increases bactericidal potency.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in southern israel: a twelve year retrospective study (1990 through 2001).
AB  == background: acute mastoiditis is a serious complication of acute otitis media (aom) and has been increasingly reported in the last decade. objectives: to report the experience accumulated with acute mastoiditis at the soroka university medical center, beer-sheva, israel, in a period of increasing antimicrobial resistance with streptococcus pneumoniae. patients and methods: we reviewed the records of all children with acute mastoiditis hospitalized from 1990 through 2001. acute mastoiditis was diagnosed when one or more of the physical signs of mastoiditis (swelling, erythema, tenderness of the retroauricular area and anteroinferior displacement of the auricle) were diagnosed in the presence of concomitant or recent (< or =4 weeks) aom. results: one hundred sixteen episodes  of acute mastoiditis occurred in 101 children age 2 months to 14 years (median, 25 months; 19% <1 year old). the average yearly incidence was 6.1 cases per 100 000 population <14 years old, with a significant increase in the number of cases  during the study period. acute mastoiditis was the first evidence of aom in 10 (10%) patients. fever >38 degrees c and >15,000 wbc/mm3 were present in 67 and 43% of cases, respectively. irritability, retroauricular swelling, redness and protrusion of the auricle occurred more commonly in patients <3 years old (79, 90, 84 and 76% vs. 28, 42, 45 and 30%, respectively, in patients > or =3 years old; p < 0.002). computed tomography scans were performed in 54 of 116 (47%) cases and revealed bone destruction in 38 (70%). periosteal abscess and lateral sinus vein thrombosis were diagnosed in 8 and 2 patients, respectively. simple mastoidectomy was done in 32 of 116 (28%) cases, after no response to intravenous antibiotics was observed; ventilation tubes were inserted in 12 patients. cultures were obtained at admission in 83 (72%) episodes (71 by tympanocentesis and 12 from ear discharges). overall 43 pathogens were isolated: 34 at admission; 14 at surgery; and 5 at both occasions. the most commonly isolated organisms were s. pneumoniae (14 of 43, 33%; 4 penicillin-nonsusceptible), streptococcus pyogenes (11 of 43, 26%), nontypable haemophilus influenzae (6 of 43, 14%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 of 43, 12%) and escherichia coli (4 of 43, 9%). all s.  pneumoniae organisms were isolated between 1996 and 2001. conclusions: (1) the incidence of acute mastoiditis in children in southern israel is greater than that reported in the literature; (2) a significant increase in the number of cases was recorded during the study period; (3) the clinical picture of acute mastoiditis was more severe in infants and young children; (4) the pathogen distribution in acute mastoiditis differs from that of aom with significantly higher rates of s. pyogenes and lower rates of nontypable h. influenzae recovery; (5) penicillin-nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae played only a minor role in the etiology of acute mastoiditis in southern israel.

TI  == epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria causing skin and soft tissue infections in the usa and europe: a guide to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == susceptibility data for all organisms associated with a range of skin and soft tissue infections (ssti) in hospitalised patients were studied. data were reported by clinical laboratories in the usa, france, germany, italy and spain during 2001 which participate in the surveillance network (tsn). staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most prevalent pathogens in all countries. mrsa was detected in 44.4, 34.7, 12.4, 41.8 and 32. 4% of s. aureus in each country, respectively. the majority of mrsa were cross resistant to other compound classes tested except for vancomycin (100% susceptible) trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole with range 1.7% (france) to 15.9% (italy) resistant, and gentamicin with range 12.2% (france) to 87.0% (italy) resistant. more than 99.0% of mssa tested susceptible to ceftriaxone and >94.9% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. 87.2% (france) to 94.6% of mssa (germany) were ciprofloxacin susceptible; 73.2% (usa) to 86.6% (spain) were erythromycin susceptible; 85.4% (italy) to 99.2% (france) were gentamicin susceptible. mssa were more frequently found and generally more antibiotic susceptible from out patients. overall, 100% of streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. macrolide resistance  was common among s. agalactiae (20.7%, germany to 10%, italy and spain), s. pyogenes (19.2%, france to 11.1%, usa) and viridans streptococci (25.7%, france to 14.1%, germany). vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. were uncommon outside  the usa (17.5%) and italy (7.4%). for all countries susceptibility of e. coli was 100% to imipenem, >98.7% to amikacin, >96.0% to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. susceptibility of e. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin was 77.6% in spain to 94.3% in germany. klebsiella spp., proteus spp., citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. displayed varying susceptibilities between countries to drugs tested. putative extended spectrum beta-lactamase expression in e. coli remained rare comprising 4-5% of isolates in usa, italy and spain and in france and germany <2%. for p. aeruginosa piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem and ceftazidime were the most active compounds tested irrespective of region. surveillance data should be  considered when selecting empirical therapy for treating ssti.

TI  == many chemokines including ccl20/mip-3alpha display antimicrobial activity.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that beta-defensins exhibit chemotactic activity by sharing the chemokine receptor ccr6 with the cc chemokine ligand ccl20/macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha (mip-3alpha). structural analysis of ccl20/mip-3alpha revealed that most of the positively charged residues are concentrated at one area of its topological surface, a characteristic considered  to be important for the antimicrobial activity of defensins. here, we report that similar to defensins, ccl20/mip-3alpha has antimicrobial effects on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. additionally,  by screening a total of 30 human chemokines, we have identified an additional 17  human chemokines, which exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro. collectively, about two-thirds of the chemokines investigated so far has the capacity to kill microorganisms in vitro, suggesting that antimicrobial activity may be another host-defense function for certain chemokines. comparison of the structural characteristics between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial chemokines suggests that topological formation of a large, positively charged electrostatic patch on  the surface of the molecule is likely to be a common structural feature of antimicrobial chemokines.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of 4903 bacterial isolates to gemifloxacin--an advanced fluoroquinolone.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against over 4900 bacterial isolates was determined by microbroth dilution with interpretation in accordance with nccls guidelines. susceptibility results were compared with those for ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. gemifloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones were not affected by either beta-lactamase production or penicillin-resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. the mic90 values for gemifloxacin were: s. pneumoniae 0.063 mg/l; haemophilus influenzae 0.016 mg/l; moraxella catarrhalis 0.008 mg/l, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 0.063 mg/l; methicillin-susceptible streptococcus pyogenes 0.031 mg/l; enterobacteriaceae 0.031-0.16 mg/l; pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 mg/l; neisseria meningitidis 0.008 mg/l. the mic90 for gemifloxacin was lower than those for the  other quinolones tested against s. pneumoniae (ciprofloxacin 2-4 mg/l, gatifloxacin 0.5 mg/l, levofloxacin 1-2 mg/l, moxifloxacin 0.25 mg/l). this study confirms the enhanced potent activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive pathogens, its broad-spectrum, gram-negative activity and indicates that gemifloxacin is likely to have an important role in treating patients with gram-positive and/or gram-negative infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant activities of the essential oil and methanol extracts of herbal parts and callus cultures of satureja hortensis l.
AB  == the present study was designated to evaluate the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the essential oil, obtained by using a clevenger distillation apparatus, water soluble (polar) and water insoluble (nonpolar) subfractions of the methanol extracts from aerial parts of satureja hortensis l. plants, and methanol extract from calli established from the seeds using gamborg's b5 basal media supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (1.0 ppm), 6-benzylaminopurine (n(6)-benzyladenine) (1.0 ppm), and sucrose (2.5%). the antimicrobial test results showed that the essential oil of s. hortensis had great potential antimicrobial activities against all 23 bacteria and 15 fungi and yeast species tested. in contrast, the methanol extract from callus cultures and water soluble  subfraction of the methanol extract did not show antimicrobial activities, but the nonpolar subfraction had antibacterial activity against only five out of 23 bacterial species, which were bacillus subtilis, enterococcus fecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. antioxidant studies suggested that the polar subfractions of the methanol extract of intact plant and methanol extract of callus cultures were able to reduce the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl to the yellow-colored diphenylpicrylhydrazine. in this assay, the strongest effect was observed for the tissue culture extract, with an ic(50) value of 23.76 +/- 0.80 microgram/ml, which could be compared with the synthetic antioxidant agent butylated hydroxytoluene. on the other hand, linoleic acid oxidation was 95% inhibited in the presence of the essential oil while the inhibition was 90% with the chloroform subfraction of the intact plant. the chemical composition of a hydrodistilled essential oil of s. hortensis was analyzed by gas chromatography (gc)/flame ionization detection (fid) and a gc-mass spectrometry system. a total  22 constituents representing 99.9% of the essential oil were identified by gc-fid analaysis. thymol (29.0%), carvacrol (26.5%), gamma-terpinene (22.6%), and p-cymene (9.3%) were the main components.

TI  == [cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
AB  == as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of  staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

TI  == [cefepime (maxipime) treatment efficacy in surgical patients ].
AB  == between september and december 2001 in the "caritas" surgical clinic of bucharest has been conducted a clinical study for the efficiency of cefepime (maxipime) treatment in surgical patients. introduced in therapy in the last decade of the xxth century, cefepime (maxipime) is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin, due to its extended spectrum of activity and its high resistance against beta-lactamases. cefepime (maxipime) has a very large spectrum, including the majority of the microorganisms implicated in surgical infections: enterobacter, klebsiella pneumoniae/speciae, proteus mirabilis, bacillus fragillis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, citrobacter and other gram-negative  bacilii, gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes). the clinical study included 30 surgical patients, the selection criteria being the severity of the present infection or the potential risk after major (abdominal) surgery. we introduced cefepime (maxipime) as first  choice of monotheraphy, except: severe, life threatening nosocomial infections, when we associated cefepime (maxipime) with aminoglycosides; failure of another antibiotheraphy schema, when we associated cefepime (maxipime) with aminoglycosides; suspicion of anaerobe contamination, when we associated cefepime (maxipime) with metronidazole. the results of our study support the utilization of cefepime (maxipime) as the best choice antibiotic in severe surgical infections, especially in the intensive care and surgical units. cefepime (maxipime) can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and imidazoles (metronidazole).

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == colonization of burn wounds in ain shams university burn unit.
AB  == a prospective study was carried out on 70 burned patients admitted to the burn unit, ain shams university hospital, cairo, with the aim to verify the pattern of microbial colonization of burn wounds. throughout the study period starting from  1 june 1999 till 31 may 2001, 281 sampling procedures (surface swabs) were performed from the burn wounds. a total of 301 microbial isolates were grown in cultures. eight different species of bacteria, and only one species of candida (c. albicans) were detected. there was no incidence of recovery of anaerobic microorganisms. our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.6%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (15.2%), then escherichia coli (13.6%), staphylococcus aureus (13.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (11.6%), streptococcus pyogenes (8.3%), enterobacter species (6.6%), and lastly streptococcus faecalis and candida albicans (5.9 and 3.6%, respectively). studying the time-related changes in burn wound microbial colonization showed an initial predominance of gram-positive cocci upon admission (70.7%) over gram-negative bacilli (27.6%). during the first 5 days, gram-negative bacilli started to predominate (55.7%) over gram-positive cocci (40.3%). burn wound sampling performed starting from the sixth day onwards, revealed further prevalence of gram-negative bacilli (72.7%) over gram-positive cocci (22.7%). as for candida albicans, there was a gradual increase in the frequency of its recovery as time elapsed from admission. it is crucial for every burn institution to determine the specific pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, the time-related changes in the dominant flora, and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. this would enable early treatment of imminent septic episodes with proper empirical systemic antibiotics, without waiting for culture results, thus improving the overall infection-related morbidity and mortality.

TI  == current status of bacterial resistance in the otolaryngology field: results from  the second nationwide survey in japan.
AB  == the study reported here was a nationwide assessment of otitis media (466 patients with acute suppurative otitis media and 476 with chronic suppurative otitis media), sinusitis (447 with acute sinusitis and 426 with chronic sinusitis), acute tonsillitis (724 patients), and peritonsillar abscess (141 patients) performed between november 1998 and march 1999. eighty university hospitals, 79 affiliated hospitals, and 103 general practitioners participated. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus(mrsa) comprised 15.6% of the 786 isolated strains of s. aureus. mrsa was frequently detected in patients with suppurative otitis media, but was uncommon in those with acute tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess, and it was more common in those who had already been treated than in those who had not, with a significant difference between the groups. vancomycin (vcm) showed the highest antimicrobial activity against mrsa and no vcm resistance was detected. penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae(pssp), penicillin-intermediate-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) accounted for 49.6%, 28.5%, and 21.9% of the 228 isolated strains of s. pneumoniae, respectively. pisp and prsp were frequently detected in children aged 5 years or younger. beta-lactamase was produced by 96 of the 100 strains (96%) of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. the 281 strains of haemophilus influenzae isolated consisted of 199 beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-sensitive (blnase) strains (70.8%), 65 beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) strains (23.1%), and 17 beta-lactamase-producing strains (6.0%). blnar strains were frequently detected in pretreated patients. of these 281 strains of h. influenzae, 214 had nontypable capsules. in conclusion, the major bacterial species showed resistance to beta-lactams, indicating that care should be taken when selecting an appropriate  antimicrobial agent.

TI  == target site penetration of fosfomycin in critically ill patients.
AB  == objective: the present study was undertaken to investigate the target site penetration properties of fosfomycin, an antibiotic particularly suitable for treatment of soft tissue infections (stis) in critically ill patients. methods and results: the study population included nine patients with sepsis. penetration of fosfomycin into the interstitial space fluid of skeletal muscle was measured using the microdialysis technique, following a single intravenous administration  of 8.0 g of fosfomycin to patients. the median (range) fosfomycin area under the  concentration versus time profile for plasma and skeletal muscle were 673 (459-1108) and 477 (226-860) mg x h/l (p < 0.011), respectively. interstitial maximum concentrations were lower than plasma values (p < 0.029). median fosfomycin concentrations in the interstitium and plasma exceeded 70 mg/l throughout the observation period of 4 h and covered mics for streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. simulation of bacterial growth inhibition of s. pyogenes, based on tissue concentration data, confirmed the bactericidal properties of fosfomycin described in previous studies. conclusion: fosfomycin concentrations in muscle interstitium and plasma  exceeded the mics for a range of clinically relevant pathogens in critically ill  patients. thus, fosfomycin exhibits a tissue pharmacokinetic profile, which appears to offer an alternative to other broad-spectrum antibiotics in intensive  care patients suffering from sti.

AB  == the aim of this study was to analyze medical outcomes, including risks for complications and mortality, in 332 adult patients hospitalized for cellulitis. the infection was documented microbiologically in 128 cases (39%). staphylococcus aureus (46 cases) and streptococcus pyogenes (22 cases) were the most frequent causative pathogens. overall, 63 patients (19%) were discharged early (< or =4 days) and 166 patients (50%) were hospitalized for more than 4 days without developing any complications. one hundred three patients (31%) had one or more complications or died. of these, 78 required surgical debridement, 10 required plastic surgery, 7 underwent amputation, and 15 had shock on presentation. when comparing the three study groups (patients discharged early, patients hospitalized for < or =4 days without complications, and patients who developed 1 or more complication or who died), patients who were discharged early (low risk)  were more frequently female and were less likely to have multiple comorbid conditions, hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency, and/or cutaneous necrosis at presentation. overall mortality (<30 days) was 5% (16/332 patients). factors associated with death were male sex, presence of multiple comorbid conditions, congestive heart failure, morbid obesity, hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency, shock, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cellulitis. these findings can be used to stratify patients with acute cellulitis according to risks for complications and  mortality and may be helpful when deciding the most appropriate means of care, i.e. outpatient treatment or hospitalization.

TI  == bacterial aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in south african children.
AB  == little is known of the aetiology, serotypes or susceptibility of the pathogens causing non-resolving otitis media in children receiving care from specialists in private practice in developed or in developing countries. increased access to antibiotics in the community amongst children receiving such private care in south africa may be anticipated to lead to levels of resistance similar to those  found in countries with similar models of private practice, such as the united states. this study was conducted to determine the aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in south african children receiving private care and to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns and serotypes of the bacterial isolates. middle-ear fluid was cultured from 173 children aged two months to seven years with non-resolving acute otitis media accompanied by persistent pain or fever who were referred to otorhinolaryngologists for drainage of middle-ear fluid within 14 days of the start of symptoms. while 92 per cent of the children had recently  received antibiotics and 54 per cent were currently receiving them, bacteria were isolated from 47 children (27 per cent). streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (35), followed by haemophilus influenzae (nine), staphylococcus aureus (six), moraxella catarrhalis (two), streptococcus pyogenes (two) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (one). two isolates were identified in each of eight children. antimicrobial resistance to one or more antibiotics was found in 33/35  (94 per cent) of the pneumococci isolated, with resistance to penicillin in 86 per cent, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 54 per cent and to erythromycin and clindamycin in 69 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. the pneumococcal serotypes found were 19f (28 per cent), 14 (26 per cent), 23f (23 per cent), 6b (nine per cent), 19a (87 per cent), and four (three per cent). children with a bacterial pathogen isolated were younger (mean age of 17 months)  than children from whom no bacteria were isolated (mean age of 23 months; p = 0.03). isolation of a pneumococcus was also significantly associated with younger age (mean = 16 months versus 22 months, p = 0.03), the presence of fever (or = 2.15, p = 0.049), and having one or more prior episodes of otitis media within the six months before tympanocentesis (or = 7.72, p = 0.03). almost all pneumococci isolated from non-resolving acute otitis media in this community are  antibiotic-resistant and should be considered especially in young children who have failed previous therapy and who have non-resolving pain or fever.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in children: pseudomonas aeruginosa as a leading pathogen.
AB  == objective: acute mastoiditis is a serious bacterial infection of the temporal bone and is the most common complication of otitis media. the goal of this study  is to assess the clinical features, pathogens, management, and outcome of acute mastoiditis in children in northern israel. methods: a systematic review of medical records of all children who were admitted with acute mastoiditis from january 1990 through december 2000. results: fifty-seven children were included.  median was age: 36 months. in 26 patients (45.6%) mastoiditis complicated the first episode of acute otitis media (aom). twenty-five children (44%) received antibiotic treatment prior to admission. frequent symptoms included mastoid area  erythema in 54 children (94.7%), proptosis of the auricle in 52 children (91.2%)  and fever in 43 children (75.4%). middle ear, and subperiostal culture yielded growth of pathogen in 30 children (75%), two cultures yielded more then one pathogen. the most frequent pathogens were: pseudomonas aeruginosa in 10 children (25%), streptococcus pneumoniae in eight children (20%), group a streptococcus in six children (15%). the highest incidence of streptococcus pneumoniae was found in children who did not suffer from aom before admission (35 vs. 5%). fifty-two (91.2%) children were cured with antibiotic treatment alone. seventeen children underwent computed tomography (ct) of the mastoid. mastoid bone destruction was demonstrated in six children and subperiostal abscess in eight. mastoidectomy was performed in five children. conclusions: the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis can be made on clinical basis alone requiring ct only when complications are suspected. half of the children admitted with acute mastoiditis had no previous history of recurrent aom. in those children s. pneumoniae was the leading pathogen while p. aeruginosa was more prevalent in children with recurrent aom. most of the children recovered with medical therapy alone, without surgical intervention.

TI  == keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
AB  == human beta defensin 2 (hbetad-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. we hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2, measured by reverse transcription-pcr, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetad-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. expression of hbetad-2 was induced consistently by s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of s.  pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetad-2. no correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2. s. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetad-2 than s. epidermidis. we conclude that the ability to induce hbetad-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetad-2 expression by s. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. induction of expression  of hbetad-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable s. epidermidis to survive on  the skin surface and modulate hbetad-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.

TI  == application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus (mssa) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci  and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), mssa (n=187), haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. the mic value at which 90% of all enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, mssa, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (mic90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.

TI  == proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide ll-37.
AB  == effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the  antibacterial peptide ll-37. analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by p. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at asn-leu and asp-phe, followed by two breaks at arg-ile, thus inactivating the  peptide. proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded ll-37 as determined by  sds-page. ex vivo, p. aeruginosa elastase induced ll-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. the degradation was blocked  by the metalloproteinase inhibitors gm6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited p. aeruginosa elastase, p. mirabilis proteinase, and e. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor e64 (which inhibited s. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [deltaua(2s)-galnac(4,6s)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of ll-37. the results indicate that proteolytic degradation of ll-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.

TI  == intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to  human subjects. methods: thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. the indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole  (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results: all the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by hplc. the level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. a mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. the level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. conclusion: the vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the mic(90) against proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterobacter spp.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing of caenorhabditis elegans by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == caenorhabditis elegans is currently introduced as a new, facile, and cheap model  organism to study the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas  aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. the mechanisms of killing involve either diffusible exotoxins or infection-like processes. recently, it was shown that also some gram-positive bacteria kill c. elegans, although the precise mechanisms of killing remained open. we examined c. elegans as a pathogenesis model for the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes, a major human pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of diseases. we demonstrate that s. pyogenes kills c. elegans, both on solid and in liquid medium. unlike p. aeruginosa and s. enterica serovar typhimurium, the killing by s. pyogenes is solely mediated by hydrogen peroxide. killing required live streptococci; the killing capacity depends on the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, and killing can be inhibited by catalase. major exotoxins of s. pyogenes are not involved in  the killing process as confirmed by using specific toxin inhibitors and knockout  mutants. moreover, no accumulation of s. pyogenes in c. elegans is observed, which excludes the involvement of infection-like processes. preliminary results show that s. pneumoniae can also kill c. elegans by hydrogen peroxide production. hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing might represent a common mechanism by which gram-positive, catalase-negative pathogens kill c. elegans.

AB  == the antibiotic and chlorhexidine (chx) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus (not mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (mbc) and/or minimal inhibitory (mic) concentrations. non-fermentative bacteria tolerated chx at high concentrations; gram-positive cocci, especially s. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. we found a good correlation between chx and  antibiotic susceptibility in both mic and mbc among gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in mbc among gram-positive bacteria. resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate  increased chx resistance among gram-negative bacteria. this finding gives clinicians the ability to predict chx susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  == the skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. resident gram-positive  bacteria include staphylococcus, micrococcus, and corynebacterium sp. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. in order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. epidermal infections caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. the pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. moreover, s. aureus and s. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus, bartonella sp., klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.

TI  == in vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  == fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. the trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. we determined the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (tem), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. all gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/l of carboxyfullerene, whereas gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/l carboxyfullerene. bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for gram-positive species, particularly for streptococcus pyogenes a-20, which was killed rapidly. intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by tem and anti-carboxyfullerene  binding assay. damage to the cell membrane in gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. these findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of dq-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the  most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas  aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.

TI  == [current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ent-infections].
AB  == in bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. s. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. to decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ent-infections is necessary. the new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical  trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. efficacy of  short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. in more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. in more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are widely used and effective. ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). a dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ent-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.

TI  == cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative  pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does  not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg  twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == an observational study on the epidemiology of respiratory tract bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility to four injectable beta-lactam antibiotics: piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  == bacterial infections of the respiratory tract account for a large proportion of total medical consultations in general practice. in recent years, antibiotic resistance has increased alarmingly in a number of bacterial species that are common causes of these infections. the aim of this observational study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of microbial agents isolated from patients with acute or acutely exacerbated respiratory infections. subjects recruited as potential sources of bacteria were either outpatients seen in a number of specialized clinics and hospital practices, or hospitalized patients. overall, 648 consecutive patients (67% male, mean age 48.1+/-27.0 years) with infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract were observed during a 13-month period. a total of 551 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated and tested for their in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. among all isolates, the four most frequent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (132 isolates, 24%), streptococcus pyogenes (99 isolates,  18%), staphylococcus aureus (93 isolates, 17%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (46 isolates, 8%). the susceptibility of gram-positive isolates ranged from 97.5% to  95.1%, and no remarkable difference was found in the antibacterial activity of tested b-lactam antibiotics. the susceptibility of gram-negative isolates to piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam was also similar: 96.5% and 97.1%, respectively. in contrast, differences were found between piperacillin (or piperacillin/tazobactam) and either ceftazidime (p=0.003) or ceftriaxone (p<0.0003) in gram-negative isolates. we conclude that, despite the extensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) in medical practice during the past three decades, the susceptibility of the most common pathogens involved in the etiology of upper and lower respiratory tract infections to these antibiotics is still high. in particular, bacterial resistance developed by gram-positive organisms against piperacillin is negligible and not alarming.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

AB  == the phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of n-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine t for comparison. chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (n-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine t: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, streptococcus pyogenes and proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in staphylococcus aureus. with chloramine t, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. the chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of  activated c-h compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of n-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. the initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of  thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. the increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal n-chloro compounds by which the loss of n-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == dermatan sulphate is released by proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria and inactivates antibacterial alpha-defensin.
AB  == defensins represent an evolutionarily conserved group of small peptides with potent antibacterial activities. we report here that extracellular proteinases secreted by the human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes release dermatan sulphate by degrading dermatan sulphate-containing proteoglycans, such as decorin. dermatan sulphate was found to bind to neutrophil-derived alpha-defensin, and this binding completely neutralized its bactericidal activity. during infection, proteoglycan degradation and release of dermatan sulphate may therefore represent a previously unknown virulence mechanism, which could serve as a target for novel antibacterial strategies.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == predictors of infectious complications after burn injuries in children.
AB  == background: infections are the major life-threatening complication of burn injury and occur with the greatest frequency in children. knowledge of their occurrence  and management, however, is extrapolated from studies in adults. we performed a prospective study of infectious complications in burned children. objective: to delineate epidemiology, risk factors and microbiology of infections in burned children where burn care and surgical interventions are optimal. methods: children hospitalized for burns were entered into prospective study. characteristics of the burn injury were assessed, and active surveillance for infections was performed. results: seventy patients were entered [mean age, 42 months; mean total body surface area (tbsa), burn 15%]. twenty-seven percent of patients developed 39 infections: 13 involved the burn wound (burn wound sepsis,  6; graft loss, 5; and cellulitis, 2); 13 were catheter-associated septicemia; 13  involved other sites (i.e. pneumonia, 4; urinary tract infection, 3; bacteremia,  2; endocarditis, 1; myocardial abscess, 1; toxin-mediated syndrome, 1; and otitis media, 1). twenty-three infections were caused by a single organism, 9 infections by more than 1 organism and in 7 infections defined by cdc criteria no organism was recovered. organisms causing infection were: staphylococcus aureus, 19; candida albicans, 4; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4; coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 4; enterococcus sp., 3; escherichia coli, 1; klebsiella oxytoca,  1; serratia marcescens, 1; streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; streptococcus pyogenes, 1; aspergillus fumigatus, 1; and candida parapsilosis, 1. burn mechanism (flame and inhalation), extent (tbsa >30%) and depth (full thickness) were risk factors  for infection; young age and site of burn were not. conclusion: the most common infections occurring in burn children are burn wound infections and catheter-associated septicemia. characteristics of burn injury predict risk of infection. children with flame and inhalation injury, tbsa burned >30% and full thickness burns are at high risk of infectious complications.

TI  == bacteriology of surgical site infections and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates at a tertiary care hospital in karachi.
AB  == objective: to study post surgical infections and sensitivity of the isolates so that recommendations can be made for their prevention and empirical antibiotic treatment. setting: swabs/pus specimens from the patients developing surgical site infections at pns shifa, karachi were processed in the department of pathology during january, 1998 to september, 1999. methods: one hundred and twenty-nine swabs/pus specimens from various types of surgical sites suspected to be infected on clinical grounds were processed, by standard methods and antibiotic susceptibility testing of all the isolates was done by using modified  kirby baur disc diffusion technique. results: of the one hundred and fifty-three  organisms isolated, the most common was staphylococcus aureus (50.32%), followed  by pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.3%), escherichia coli (14.37%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.76%), miscellaneous gram negative rods (5.88%) and streptococcus pyogenes (1.30%). about 50% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. in case of pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli  more than 60% of the isolates were found resistant to gentamicin. the resistance  to third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone ciprofloxacin was also quite high. other isolates also showed a very high level of antibiotic resistance. conclusion: in addition to the economic burden for antibiotic treatment, such infections for multi-resistant organisms are a serious threat to our surgical patients. to prevent these happenings, there is an urgent need to adopt basic principles of asepsis and sterilisation and to make judicious use of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and development of resistance in bacteria.
AB  == the correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and the emergence of resistance in bacteria is complex and has proved difficult to establish. besides antimicrobial use, many other distinct contributing factors are also involved in the issue. despite this complexity, there is a substantial body of evidence that the use of antibiotics in prophylaxis and in therapy is associated  with the development of resistance in the hospital and in the community. some examples are reviewed, including increase of resistance in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes after the use of beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. success in reversing the rise of resistant strains has been rarely described. two examples are highlighted, the reduction in the incidence of nasal carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci in icelandic  children, and a significant decline in erythromycin resistance in s. pyogenes after the reduction in the use of macrolides in finland.

TI  == isolation, cdna cloning and gene expression of an antibacterial protein from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, oryctes rhinoceros.
AB  == an antibacterial protein, designated rhinocerosin, was purified to homogeneity from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, oryctes rhinoceros immunized with escherichia coli. based on the amino acid sequence of the n-terminal region, a degenerate primer was synthesized and reverse-transcriptase pcr was performed to  clone rhinocerosin cdna. as a result, a 279-bp fragment was obtained. the complete nucleotide sequence was determined by sequencing the extended rhinocerosin cdna clone by 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends. the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature portion of rhinocerosin was composed of 72 amino acids without cystein residues and was shown to be rich in glycine (11.1%) and proline (11.1%) residues. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of rhinocerosin with those of other antibacterial proteins indicated that it has 77.8% and 44.6% identity with holotricin 2 and coleoptrecin, respectively. rhinocerosin had strong antibacterial activity against e. coli, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus but not against pseudomonas aeruginosa. results of reverse-transcriptase pcr analysis of gene expression in different tissues indicated that the rhinocerosin gene is strongly expressed in the fat body and the malpighian tubule, and weakly expressed in hemocytes and midgut. in addition, gene expression was inducible by bacteria in the fat body, the malpighian tubule  and hemocyte but constitutive expression was observed in the midgut.

TI  == inhibition of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation by streptococcus pyogenes cell extract is associated with arginine deiminase activity.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus) cell extracts (ce) have a remarkably powerful and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on antigen, superantigen, or mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) proliferation in vitro. purification of the inhibitory component present in s. pyogenes type m5 (manfredo strain) ce by anion-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography showed that the inhibitor had an approximate native molecular mass of 100 kda. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified inhibitory fractions followed by silver staining gave a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 47 kda, indicating that the inhibitor is composed of two identical subunits. nh2-terminal sequencing of the protein revealed that it was identical to the previously characterized streptococcal acid glycoprotein (sagp); this protein possesses between 31.5 and 39.0% amino acid identity with arginine deiminase (ad) from mycoplasma hominis, mycoplasma arginini, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ad enzyme activity was present in unfractionated ce prepared from a range of streptococcal strains, and partially purified inhibitory fractions of manfredo ce also had high levels of activity. the inhibitory effect of manfredo ce was overcome by the addition of l-arginine to proliferation assays in which human pbmc were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. we conclude that sagp, or its homolog, possesses ad activity and that the potent inhibition of proliferation of human t cells by streptococcal ce is due to activity of this enzyme.

TI  == discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  == a 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. antibacterial assays against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli imp- and a candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position a (secondary amine), at the  end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. the range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting  the first-round active sublibraries. pyridinopolyamine positions b (secondary benzylamine) and c (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. high-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18,  and 21 with mics of 1-5 microm against s. pyogenes and e. coli imp-. using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position c and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position b with position d (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier ii panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, s. pyogenes, s. pyogenes (wild-type), streptomyces aureus, and enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at mics of 1-12 microm, whereas mics for e.  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were >  100 microm. these eight compounds were not active (> 100 microm) against fungus c. albicans.

AB  == we describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. for comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of  s. aureus, two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of klebsiella pneumoniae. all except two strains of s. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. when s. aureus numr1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with  fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. when 14 strains of clinically isolated s. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (p < 0.01) but not with  the titer of clumping factor. injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain du5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated  from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain du5789. our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne  staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial action of cecropin and proline-arginine-rich peptides from pig intestine.
AB  == two antimicrobial peptides, cecropin p1 (cp1), with a c-terminal carboxyl group,  and pr-39, with an amidated, c-terminus, are found in the small intestine of the  pig. each is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. we have synthesized these peptides and several analogs, including the d-enantiomers  and the retro sequences, each with a free or acetylated amino terminus. the cp1 amide was also prepared. the retro cp1 peptides were much less active than the parent cp1 peptide, confirming the importance of sequence or the amide bond and helix dipole direction, and the n alpha-acetyl peptides were also less active, indicating that a free amino terminus is essential for high activity. the ratio of the lethal concentration of l/d isomers of cp1 is less than 1 for gram-negative, but greater than 1 for gram-positive bacteria. pr-39 showed no significant chiral selectivity toward escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus pyogenes, but the l/d ratio was high for pseudomonas aeruginosa (66), and very high for staphylococcus aureus (> 1000). in the latter case the lethal concentration for the d-isomer was 0.57 microm, whereas this organism was  quite resistant to the l-isomer (> 600 microm). thus the enantiomers of cp1 and pr-39 are not equally active for all species. in a plate assay with a very small  log-phase inoculum of staph aureus, d-pr-39 produced a clear zone of killing surrounded by a zone of stimulated growth. after prolonged incubation the two zones became one clear zone. addition of d-pr-39 to the wells of a dense turbid plate of growing cells showed a cleared zone for each of the test organisms, indicating that pr-39 lyses the bacteria rather than simply inhibiting their multiplication.

TI  == in-vitro pharmacodynamic studies of piperacillin/tazobactam with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  == six isolates each of enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter spp., serratia spp., acinetobacter spp. and enterobacter  spp. (total 60 strains) were studied against the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam plus gentamicin or ciprofloxacin at physiological concentrations by the microtitre chequerboard method incorporating simultaneous time-kill curves. tazobactam was fixed at 4 mg/l. gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam was a synergic combination against 28 strains at 2 h, 51  at 5 h and 54 at 24 h as assessed by time-kill curves and synergic or additive (fbc index < or = 1) against all 60 strains at 24 h by chequerboards. the corresponding figures for ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam were seven,  26, 52 and 58 respectively. antagonism (fbc index > or = 4) was demonstrated for  one strain to each combination at 24 h. there were no significant differences between fic indices and fbc indices for each antibiotic combination. gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 47 strains by 2 h, 56 by  5 h and 59 by 24 h. ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log  kill for 22 strains by 2 h, 36 by 5 h and 56 by 24 h. in conclusion both antibiotic combinations at physiological concentrations were synergic or additive at 24 h for the majority of strains tested although notably gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave faster kill. antagonism was rarely seen. both combinations are likely to prove beneficial for treatment of serious infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  == bay 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. the mic90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8 mg/l. against  the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or  = 10-fold less active. mic90s for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. against gram-negative bacteria bay 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa.  against bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. bay 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin  g, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. as compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance  was less pronounced. the spontaneous mutation frequency towards bay 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in s. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == survival of potentially pathogenic human-associated bacteria in the rhizosphere of hydroponically grown wheat.
AB  == plants may serve as reservoirs for human-associated bacteria (h-ab) in long-term  space missions containing bioregenerative life support systems. the current study examined the abilities of five human-associated potential pathogens, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli, to colonize and grow in the rhizosphere of hydroponically grown wheat, a candidate crop for life support. all of these bacteria have been recovered from past nasa missions and present potential problems for future missions. the abilities of these organisms to adhere to the roots of axenic five-day-old wheat (triticum aestivum l. cv. yecora rojo) were evaluated by enumeration of the attached organisms after a one hour incubation of roots in a suspension (approximately 10(8) cfu ml-1) of the h-ab. results showed that a greater percentage of p. aeruginosa cells adhered to the wheat roots than the other four h-ab. similarly incubated seedlings were also grown under attempted axenic conditions for seven days to examine the potential of each organism to proliferate in the rhizosphere (root colonization capacity). p. cepacia and p. aerogiunosa showed considerable growth, e. coli and s. aureus showed no significant growth, and s. pyogenes died off in the wheat rhizosphere. studies examining the effects of competition on the survival of these microorganisms indicated that p. aeruginosa was the only organism that survived in the rhizosphere of hydroponically grown wheat in the presence of different levels of  microbial competition.

TI  == enhancement of host resistance to bacterial infections in normal and immunosuppressed mice with actinobacillus suis.
AB  == a single intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation of heat-killed actinobacillus suis atcc 15,557 (as 15,557) into normal and immunosuppressed (dexamethasone-treated) mice  led to remarkable nonspecific resistance to ip challenge with lethal doses of opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans. the duration of this enhanced protective action and the minimal effective dose, in normal mice, induced by as 15,557 were superior to those induced by other bacterial immunostimulants such as heat-killed lavtobacillus casei yit 9018 (lc 9018) and penicillin-treated streptococcus pyogenes, su (ok-432). in immunosuppressed mice; the reduced in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (pecs) against p. aeruginosa infection was markedly augmented by ip injection of as 15,557. the degree of pec  augmentation induced by as 15,557 was higher than that induced by lc 9018 or by ok-432. the toxicity and histopathological changes associated with as 15557 were  very low, as compared with those by produced by lc 9018 and ok-432. the results suggest that as 15,557, which showed a strong resistance-enhancing capacity against opportunistic bacterial infections, may be a useful bacterial immunostimulant.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of cs-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. the in vitro activity of cs-940 against gram-positive bacteria  was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. in particular, cs-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the mic at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cs-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. the activity of cs-940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum  size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. cs-940 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by s. aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa, cs-940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains  tested. against experimental pneumonia with k. pneumoniae in mice, cs-940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. these results suggest that cs-940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections.

TI  == glycerol and ichthammol: medicinal solution or mythical potion?
AB  == glycerol and ichthammol (g & i) has been used for generations by otologists. however, there is a paucity of information on both its mode of action and its anti-bacterial properties. the aim of this paper was to ascertain firstly, what the most common organisms found in discharging ears were and secondly, what antibacterial activity g & i had against these organisms. all ear swabs from 1992-1994 in our unit were reviewed to ascertain the prevalence of the commonly isolated organisms. fresh isolates of these organisms were collected and plated onto agar with wells of glycerol, ichthammol and a combination of both as used in clinical practice. the diameters of the zones of inhibition observed after incubation were measured in millimetres. common isolates were: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabalis, streptococcus pyogenes in descending order of frequency. pure glycerol showed no significant zones of inhibition against any of the organisms tested. the average zones of inhibition for g & i and ichthammol alone were for staphylococcus aureus 15 mm and 18 mm and for streptococcus pyogenes: 16 mm and 23 mm. ichthammol alone was significantly more effective than g & i (p < 0.001). there was no significant activity against  proteus mirabalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the therapeutic benefit of g & i is due in part to the inherent anti-bacterial activity of ichthammol against the gram positive organisms as well as its anti-inflammatory action and the dehydrating effect of the glycerol.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == [a new device for the disinfection of handpieces and turbines].
AB  == dental handpieces are often difficult to disinfect. this is one of the main reasons for the considerable risk of cross-infections in dental offices. the aim  of the present study was the evaluation of the disinfectant property of a recent, commercially available, automatic instrument, described as capable to clean, disinfect and lubricate dental handpieces. the following experimental evaluations were made: 1) antimicrobial activity of the disinfectant (glyoxalaldehyde) used.  the method described by the european committee for standardization was followed.  test microorganisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. 2) disinfection of dental handpieces (69 contra-angles and 97 turbines of different  marks). they were naturally infected using them on patients for 30 minutes at least. 3) disinfection of dental handpieces infected with bacterial suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes (beta-haemolyticus, group a), candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the results of the first experiment  showed a strong bactericidal power of the disinfectant with both the tested strains, after a contact time of only 1 minute. a great proportion of the dental  handpieces tested during the second experiment were found disinfected: from 84% through 89% out of the various models of turbine handpieces; from 89% through 100% out of the models of contra-angle handpieces. even though bacterial contamination level was low (about 10(3) microorganisms per handpiece), a satisfactory disinfectant ability in natural conditions was found. the results of the third experiment were unclear. the tested instrument reduced 10(5)-10(8) times the original bacterial count when the gram positive microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes) were used. on the other hand, when pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans were used, the results were different: the bacterial count was reduced 10(6)-10(7) times in some cases, and only 10(2) times in other cases. this difference was found in the tests made using the same attachment and in those made using various attachments. in conclusion, the tested instrument showed, in most cases, a good disinfectant property, but the presence of unclear results suggests that some technical modifications are required.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of glycerine-ichthammol in otitis externa.
AB  == the clinical efficacy of glycerine-ichthammol in otitis externa may be due to an  anti-inflammatory action of ichthammol or a dehydrating effect of glycerine on the oedematous ear canal. its antimicrobial activity, if any, against the common  organisms in otitis externa is not well known. a study of the antibacterial property of glycerine-ichthammol as measured by a growth inhibition test and a modified cidal assay, showed inhibition of selected gram positive organisms (streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus) by ichthammol and glycerine-ichthammol combination, but only negligible antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. candida albicans was also weakly inhibited. as the activity against gram negative organisms is minimal, incorporation of an anti-gram negative antibiotic such as gentamicin in the glycerine-ichthammol compound to enhance its antibacterial spectrum is suggested.

AB  == the 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. these compounds are potent bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors  which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring  juncture. abt-719 is an s isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. abt-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. abt-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the racemate and r forms of abt-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. the 50% effective doses of abt-719 were at least threefold  lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused  by salmonella typhimurium or listeria monocytogenes. in immunosuppressed mice, abt-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. the pharmacokinetic properties of abt-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. the 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.

AB  == six widely used x-ray contrast media (xrc) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using xrc to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of  using xrc in divided doses to reduce cost. preparations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml) were inoculated into the following xrc: conray 280, hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, omnipaque 350, ultravist 300 and optiray 320 each in two concentrations. sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees c and 4 degrees c. there were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the gram-negative organisms. conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. most effects were bacteriostatic. organisms were  most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with xrc. no effect was seen with dilute xrc. all weekly sterility checks were negative. non-ionic xrc have no significant effect on the growth of gram-positive organisms and little effect on gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of xrc occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of xrc utilization.

TI  == acute otorrhea: bacteriology of a common complication of tympanostomy tubes.
AB  == we prospectively followed 246 children with tympanostomy tubes and observed acute otorrhea through a functioning tube at least once in 50% of subjects. pathogens typical of acute otitis media (streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes) were found in 42% of all episodes; pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus was found in 44% of all episodes. pathogens of acute otitis media were found in 50.0% of subjects under 6 years old versus 4.4% of subjects 6 years or over at the first episode (p < .001). pseudomonas aeruginosa was found more often in children 6 years or older (43.5% versus 20.5% at the first episode, p = .052). pathogens typical of acute otitis media were less prevalent in the summer months (14.7% versus 52.2% for the first episode, p = .001), while p aeruginosa was more prevalent in summer (44.1%  versus 16.4% for the first episode, p = .006). this suggests that while many younger children with acute otorrhea may respond to treatment with oral antimicrobials alone, outpatient therapy of older children may involve use of topical antipseudomonal agents that may be complicated by the question of the safety of such medications.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--revisited.
AB  == the clinical course and causative organisms were studied in 18 patients with acute mastoiditis, 13 of whom (72%) had no previous history of middle ear disease. their age ranged from 5 months to 21 years, and duration of middle ear symptoms immediately prior to admission ranged from 1 to 45 days (average 9.7 days). none had undergone a myringotomy prior to admission, while 13 (72%) had been receiving antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media. three were admitted with intracranial complications. bacteria were isolated in 10 of the 16 patients  in whom samples were available for bacterial culture, and included streptococcus  pneumonia (2), streptococcus pyogenes (2), staphylococcus aureus (2), staphlococcus coagulase negative (2), klebsiella pneumonia (1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). of the 17 patients treated by us, 11 received surgery. acute otitis media, secretory otitis media, acute mastoiditis, subacute mastoiditis and masked mastoiditis create a continuum. antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media cannot be considered as an absolute safeguard against acute mastoiditis. when antibiotics are prescribed for acute mastoiditis before culture result is available, an anti-staphylococcal agent should be included. at least some patients with acute mastoiditis develop a primary infection of the bony framework of the middle ear cleft. the prevalence of the intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis is still high and may appear soon after or concomitant with the first sign of acute mastioditis.

TI  == otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. the microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic om is reviewed. the major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute om and half of serous om cultures are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute om. the predominant organisms isolated from chronic om are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp. many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing om can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. the appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.

TI  == the features and aetiology of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == this paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women  as well. the disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. the commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. the infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == modulation of pseudomonas aeruginosa adherence to the corneal surface by mucus.
AB  == to gain access to the corneal epithelium and cause infections keratitis, bacterial pathogens must first interact with ocular surface factors that could affect bacterial adherence. in this study, we demonstrated that the mucus layer,  and, in particular, the mucin fraction of mucus, modulated adherence to intact corneal epithelium of pseudomonas aeruginosa but not that of staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes. removal of endogenous mucus from rat or rabbit  eyes increased the adherence of p. aeruginosa by 3- to 10-fold. ocular mucus obtained from rat eyes, porcine stomach mucin, or bovine submaxillary gland mucin inhibited adherence of p. aeruginosa to uninjured corneal epithelium. the mucin fraction of ocular mucus, purified by ultracentrifugation, was found to contain the inhibitory activity, and inhibition was demonstrated at concentrations of mucin as low as 35 micrograms/ml. ocular mucin was the only material tested that  inhibited adherence of p. aeruginosa to an injured cornea. however, the binding of p. aeruginosa to immobilized substrates in vitro did not predict which fraction would possess antiadherence activity: bacteria bound well to whole ocular mucus, mucin, the nonmucin fraction of ocular mucus, and dilute human tears as well as to porcine stomach mucin and bovine submaxillary gland mucin. the effectiveness of the mucin fraction of ocular mucus at inhibiting the binding of p. aeruginosa to the cornea implies that this material is a barrier that protects the surface of the eye from p. aeruginosa adherence.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == significance of antibiotics resistance amongst clinical bacterial isolates in lagos.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility of several strains of six different species of clinical facultative pathogens involved in nosocomial infections in our hospital was investigated by a series of disc diffusion, broth dilution and chequerboard titration testing. with disc diffusion method all the test strains, except streptococcus pyogenes, were resistant to penicillin. 46% of the klebsiella aerogenes and 73% of the pseudomonas strains were generally resistant to cefotaxime. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the antibiotics correlated well with the results of the disc diffusion tests. synergistic effects were demonstrated by various combinations of gentamicin, ampicillin, clindamycin, colistin, cefoxitin, and ceftriazone against resistant strains of s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella aerogenes. against s. aureus the effect of gentamicin/clindamycin demonstrated indifference. the need for stringent caution is strongly advocated in the selection of combination therapy for serious infections caused by some hospital bacterial strains particularly in acute care units. the clinical microbiologist should be consulted at all times during the process of selection of an appropriate combined therapy for expert guidance.

TI  == rabbit cap18 derived peptides inhibit gram negative and gram positive bacteria.
AB  == cap18 (cationic antimicrobial protein of 18 kda) was originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using as an assay the agglutination of re-lipopolysaccharide  coated erythrocytes. the c-terminal 37 amino acids of cap18 comprise the lps-binding domain called rnip, reactive nitrogen inhibitory peptide. synthetic rnip has broad antimicrobial activity versus both gram positive [ic50 = 130-200 nm] and gram negative bacteria [ic50 = 20-100 nm). susceptible strains include staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes. antimicrobial activity is highly dependent upon peptide structure. although a 32  amino peptide resulting from truncation of five amino acids from the c terminus of rnip is highly active, other fragments of rnip including truncation of its n-terminus do not exhibit antimicrobial activity. unlike previously characterized antimicrobial peptides derived from granulocyte proteins rnip is active in serum. rnip or a derivative peptide may have therapeutic potential for bacterial sepsis.

TI  == cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized  n-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria rapidly. in addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. it has good affinity for pbps 2 and 3 of escherichia coli and for pbp 3 of pseudomonas aeruginosa. its broad-spectrum of activity includes gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. it is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against enterobacteriaceae. the mic90 for p. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those  of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. other gram-negative organisms, haemophilus influenzae, neiserria meningitidis, neiserria gonorrhoeae, moraxella  catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. among gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant enterobacteriaceae. only strains of p. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. in experimental infections such as meningitis, induced  with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.

AB  == we compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of dv-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. mics for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. moreover, mic50s for dv-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. dv-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and peptostreptococcus spp. at  0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the mic90 level than the other quinolones tested. the activity of dv-7751a against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the mic90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. dv-7751a showed activity comparable to  those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). dv-7751a activity  was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of dv-7751a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to dv-7751a was less than or  equal to those of the reference drugs. dv-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrases from s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.

TI  == [a nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in japan (1988-1990)].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout japan from september to december in both 1989 and 1990. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (ipm) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to ipm and aminoglycosides. bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to ipm. ipm had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (cam) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, moraxella, haemophilus and bacteroides  strains. mics80's of cam against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. mics80's against moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. laboratory-induced resistance to cam in strains of s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. adherence to silicon filter of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa or s. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-mic of cam or other macrolides. although tosufloxacin (tflx) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of p. aeruginosa strains tested, tflx showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-mics of cam or erythromycin.

TI  == immunodiagnosis of group-a streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  == seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-a streptococci were generated. all of them were of igm isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-a streptococci and polysaccharide. these were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-b, -c, -g and staphylococcus aureus. polyclonal antibodies against group-a polysaccharide (aps) were also raised in rabbits by linking aps to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. the assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng aps/ml as compared to 1 microgram aps/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-b, -c, -g, staph. aureus, cornybacterium diptheriae, candida albicans, candida spp., morexella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, strep. pneumoniae. salmonella typhi and s. paratyphi a and b. throat  swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-a, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.

AB  == surgical treatment of pyogenic infections of the sacroiliac joint is indicated in cases of ineffective conservative treatment, abscess formation, septicemia, and neurological deficits. between 1983 and 1990 in nine patients surgical treatment  was performed for pyogenic sacroiliitis under this criteria. the surgical procedure included joint debridement, primary arthrodesis of the sacroiliac joint using a autologous bone graft, antibiotic therapy and postoperative immobilisation. follow-up examination of 8 patients in average 47 months postoperatively revealed excellent functional and roentgenological results in 6 patients. two patients suffered only from mild low-back pain, none of the eight patients demonstrated signs of a recurrent infection, one patient died due to complications of a long-lasting preoperative septicemia. regarding these postoperative follow-up results surgical therapy including primary sacroiliac arthrodesis should be early considered, because this treatment has a low complication rate and the surgical technique is easy to perform and results are excellent or good in most of the patients.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == changing flora in burn and trauma units: experience in the united kingdom.
AB  == bacterial colonization of burned and devitalized tissue is inevitable. the types  of organisms that are isolated from burn wounds depend on such factors as preexisting illness, types of topical antiseptics and antimicrobials used, microbial sampling techniques, and indigenous flora that inhibit the burn unit. among organisms that are capable of producing disease, staphylococcus aureus remains the most common isolate in the patient with burns. the decrease in the prevalence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was initiated by the advent of effective topical antiseptics, appears to have continued to the present. acinetobacter is now a common organism in the burn unit; although the organism has developed resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, it infrequently causes serious problems. comparisons between burn units with intensive-care capability that practice an aggressive approach to surgical management and burn units that continue to use a more traditional approach have revealed little difference with  regard to incidence of or time to acquisition of potentially pathogenic bacteria. in a recent comparison that involved a unit of each type, marked reductions in the incidence of isolation of p. aeruginosa and streptococcus group a organisms were observed over the course of 2 years in both of the units. significant problems with viruses, yeasts, and fungi have not yet been encountered (or identified) in burn units; further study of the potential role of such organisms  in infection in the patient with burns is required.

AB  == quantification of bacteria in various types of middle ear effusion (mee) obtained during current acute otitis media (aom), otitis media with effusion (ome) and chronic suppurative otitis media (com) was performed. the bacteria were stained with acridine orange and their number per ml effusion evaluated under the fluorescence microscope according to a method described in detail elsewhere. during aom, 53% of the mee samples were culture-positive and contained 10(6)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 10(7) per ml). during ome, serous effusion and 78% of the mucoid effusions contained no bacteria whatsoever, whereas the remaining mucoid effusions contained 10(4)-5 x 10(5) bacteria per ml  (median value 10(4) per ml). mucopurulent effusions contained 6 x 10(5)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 5 x 10(6) per ml). during com, purulent mee had 6 x 10(6)-10(9) bacteria per ml (median value 10(8) per ml). quantification of bacteria involved in middle ear diseases provides further information about the etiopathogenesis and appropriate management of various pathological conditions of the middle ear.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous  antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == bacteriology of wound infection: evaluation by surface swab and quantitative full thickness wound biopsy culture.
AB  == a total of 171 cases of wounds of various aetiology were examined and screened bacteriologically for evidence of infection by surface swab culture and quantitative full thickness wound biopsy culture techniques. staphylococcus pyogenes was the most frequently isolated (39.9%) single organism. other organisms being escherichia coli (26.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4%), klebsiella species (5.8%), streptococcus pyogenes (4.9%), proteus species (4.8%)  and coliform organism (3.1%). collectively the gram-negative organisms were the majority among the isolated organisms. as indicator of wound infection, surface swab culture was found to be reliable in 72% cases when correlated with wound biopsy culture. the latter technique was found to be more consistently valuable (in 95% cases) both for regular assessment of the wounds as well as to judge the  response to treatment.

TI  == effects of growth factors, hormones, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and lipotechoic acids on the clonal growth of normal ureteral epithelial cells in serum-free culture.
AB  == in vitro tissue culture techniques were employed to study the effects of bacterial endotoxins on the growth of normal epithelial cells from the human ureter (nhu). primary cultures of nhu cells were initiated from explant outgrowth cultures of human ureteral tissue and cultured on collagen gel in f-12* medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (fcs). optimal clonal growth of secondary cultures of nhu cells seeded at relatively low seeding cell densities, directly on plastic dishes, was achieved in f-12* medium containing bovine pituitary extract (0.5% bpe) and 0.05% bsa. results indicated that insulin in the f-12* medium could be replaced by three orders of magnitude less igf-1. further clonal growth experiments demonstrated that pge1 is growth stimulatory and can replace bpe as a growth factor requirement. this finding was in agreement with the fact that bpe growth requirement could be replaced by cholera toxin or dibutyryl camp. these results suggested that both bpe and cholera toxin operated by activation of a camp-dependent mitogenic pathway. seven gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) and three gram-positive bacterial lipotechoic acids (lt) were tested for their effects on nhu clonal growth. three out of the five lps derived from escherichia coli (strains 055:b5, 0128:b12, and 0127:b8), lps from klebsiella pneumoniae, and lps from pseudomonas aeruginosa all showed significant growth inhibitory effects at minimally effective doses ranging from 5 to 25 micrograms/ml. lps derived from e. coli strain (0111:b4) had no growth effects at the highest concentration tested (100 micrograms/ml). in contrast, lt  derived from streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureas, and bacillus subtilis all markedly enhanced clonal growth at concentrations ranging from 1 microgram/ml less than [lt] less than 50 micrograms/ml. lt from strep. pyogenes was inhibitory to clonal growth at 100 micrograms/ml. the growth inhibitory effects of lps were shown to be sensitive to the presence of hydrocortisone in the growth medium, indicating that lps effects on growth are mediated via the arachidonic acid cascade. we speculate that these results indicate a link between the susceptibility of uroepithelial tissue to the pathogenic microflora seen in urinary tract diseases and the differential sensitivity of proliferation-competent uroepithelial cells to growth inhibition by lps produced by gram-negative bacteria. however, further studies with uropathogenic serotypes will be necessary to corroborate this possibility. the growth-stimulating activity of lts produced by gram-positive bacteria may be due  to their ability to bind to cell-associated fibronectin and to activate the fibronectin receptor as part of ligand receptor-induced mitogenic transmembrane signalling pathway.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem were compared with those of imipenem, ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefuzonam and cefotiam. meropenem showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against clinical isolates of gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria. against gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, meropenem exhibited the most potent activity among the drugs tested. it inhibited all 330 strains of enterobacteriaceae at 0.78 mg/l. meropenem was sensitive against several cephem-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem was four-fold more  active than imipenem and eight-fold more active than ceftazidime, with an mic90 of 0.78 mg/l. the therapeutic effect of meropenem on systemic infection in mice was ten to twenty-fold less than that of imipenem against staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. however, meropenem was as effective as imipenem on infections of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. meropenem was eliminated from mice plasma two-fold faster than imipenem, with a plasma half-life of 7.6 min. from the above results the authors concluded that meropenem is a promising drug for clinical use.

AB  == the authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (ifp) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. the infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with ifp as well as in recommended standard media. solid media used for cultivation of s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, n. meningitidis and c. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. all of these strains grew on the media prepared with ifp except s.  pneumoniae when cultured in ifp diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. only s. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. no more  differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and b. subtilis was  measured in liquid media after 8 hours. in solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in ifp-agar and nutriente agar by the number of colonies on trypticase soy agar plates. some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated  in standard media. the average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of ifp was 5.03 mg/ml. the experiments showed that culture media prepared with ifp supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. it suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.

AB  == we examined mics of 6 oral new quinolones and 4 oral cephems against bacteria isolated from patients at 6 hospitals in osaka during the period from january to  june in 1990, and the following results were obtained. 1. all species excluding streptococcus pyogenes were more sensitive with less frequencies of resistance to new quinolones than to cephems. in new quinolones, tosufloxacin (tflx) was the most active against gram-positive cocci and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and tflx had the highest activities against gram-negative rods. 2. resistant (mic of cpfx greater  than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) strains to new quinolones were observed at higher frequencies than 10% among staphylococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, serratia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia. 3. the frequency of staphylococcus aureus resistant to new quinolones isolated from in-patients or urine was significantly higher than that from out-patients or other sources. on the other hand, there was no significant difference in resistance frequencies of p. aeruginosa due to types of patients or sources. but, there were significant differences in frequencies of resistant organisms of either species to new quinolones among hospitals. 4. twenty-seven strains (19.7%) of 137 s. aureus strains examined were methicillin-resistant, and they were similarly resistant to new quinolones also. methicillin susceptible s. aureus were also similarly sensitive to new quinolones.

AB  == the pharmacodynamic effects of subinhibitory concentrations of different beta-lactam antibiotics were investigated. a postantibiotic effect (pae) was induced for different bacterial species by exposure to 10x mic of several beta-lactam antibiotics for 2 h in vitro. the antibiotic-bacterial combinations used in this study were imipenem-pseudomonas aeruginosa, benzylpenicillin-streptococcus pneumoniae and -streptococcus pyogenes, cefcanel-s. pyogenes, ampicillin-escherichia coli, and piperacillin-e. coli. after the induction of the pae, the exposed cultures as well as the unexposed controls were washed and diluted. thereafter, the cultures in the postantibiotic  phase (pa phase) and the cultures not previously treated with antibiotics were exposed to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3x mic of the relevant drug and the growth curves were compared. when bacteria in the pa phase were exposed to sub-mics, a substantial prolongation of the time before regrowth was demonstrated, especially in antibiotic-bacterial combinations for which a pae was found. in contrast, sub-mics on cultures not previously exposed to suprainhibitory antibiotic concentrations yielded only a slight reduction in growth rate compared with the controls. thus, it seems important to distinguish the direct effects of sub-mics  on bacteria not previously exposed to suprainhibitory concentrations from the effects of sub-mics on bacteria in the pa phase.

(1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  == the major pathogens causing acute otitis media (aom) are streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, with moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. the same organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. in chronic suppurative otitis media, pseudomonas aeruginosa and s aureus are most frequently found. antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating aom are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. currently, about 20% of aom cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually h influenzae or m catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in aom  than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.

TI  == modifications of plasma fibronectin in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == recurrent pulmonary infections with staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa are a major problem in cystic fibrosis (cf), leading to severe and progressive deterioration of the respiratory tract. fibronectin (fn) has a binding site(s) for s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. this bacterial bindings site(s) was studied by using fn from patients with cf and comparing them with fn  purified from the plasma of bronchitis and normal subjects by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. we found a decreased binding of the cf fn to these bacteria in all seven cf patients. other differences between the cf fn and normal fn were a marked modification in the pattern of peptide migration in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after hydrolysis with various proteinases and  an increase or decrease of the total sugar content of the fn.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == gr69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (mic90). it had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and e-1040. against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens, mics ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and  cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to gr69153, and for this organism the mic90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the e-1040 mic90, but most pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. gr69153 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. for staphylococcus aureus gr69153 mics were similar to those of ceftazidime and e-1040. enterococci and listeriae were resistant to gr69153, but streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. the activity of gr69153 was not affected by serum. gr69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and bro-1, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-9, and morganellae. gr69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. it is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. gr69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of pd 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  == pd 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. the mics for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, and s. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for s. agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis; 0.125  micrograms/ml for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. in these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, pd 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. in most instances, the in vitro potency of pd 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin g, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from belgium.
AB  == to study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in belgium. against enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. ceftibuten mic50s were less  than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). this level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to  8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. none of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. the mic90s of ceftibuten for strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml,  respectively. strains of streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. strains of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.

AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  == six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, bmy 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. the 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. all 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. they were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. cefotiam hexetil, bmy 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against staphylococcus aureus. although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of naphthoquinones from fusaria.
AB  == twenty-two naphthoquinone compounds isolated or derived synthetically from culture extracts of fusarium solani and f. oxysporum were examined for antimicrobial activity. fifteen exhibited antibiotic activity against staphylococcus aureus, and 12 were active against streptococcus pyogenes, but none were active at the highest rate of 128 micrograms/ml against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. of 8 plant pathogenic bacteria tested against 11 naphthoquinones, corynebacterium poinsettiae was inhibited by 6 compounds, and pseudomonas viridiflava was weakly inhibited by one. only one of a group of 6 fluorescent soil pseudomonads was inhibited by one naphthoquinone. antifungal activity of 10 compounds against 8 fungal plant pathogens was limited  to inhibition of phytophthora parasitica by one naphthopyran.

TI  == [activity of cefuroxime against bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media].
AB  == the acute otitis media is a frequent infantile disease and, in 80% of cases, a bacterial strain can be isolated from the otorrhoea. haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae are the two major species isolated from auricular exudate, and represent two thirds of all isolated strains, with the others comprising staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae and corynebacteria. the treatment of this disease  is based principally on beta-lactams (aminopenicillins, cephalosporins) administered by the oral route. cefuroxime is a cephalosporin which is absorbed via the digestive tract in the form of cefuroxim-axetil. the activity of this compound was studied against 210 strains isolated from otorrhoea, collected from  children who presented an acute otitis media during the first half of 1989. these strains were: 112 strains of h. influenzae, of which 23 produced a beta-lactamase; 21 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae; 3 strains of streptococcus pyogenes; 10 strains of branhamella catarrhalis of which 9 produced a beta-lactamase; 18 strains of s. aureus; 14 strains of enterobacteriaceae, and  32 strains of corynebacteria. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefuroxime-axetil was measured by dilution in agar. the mics of cefuroxime against h. influenzae were low and similar (mic 50 = 1 mg/l; mic 90 = 1 mg/l) regardless of whether the strain secreted a beta-lactamase. overall, 90% and 98%  of the 210 strains tested here were inhibited by 1 and 4 mg/l of cefuroxime respectively. these results show that the antibacterial spectrum of cefuroxime-axetil appears to be ideally suited to the bacterial strains isolated  from acute otitis media.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, win 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

TI  == protective effect of heterologous gram-positive vaccine against lethal upper respiratory tract infection with type m50 group a streptococci in mice.
AB  == type m50 group a streptococci are exceptional for their virulence in mice. however, intranasal (i.n.) vaccination with heat-killed group a streptococci, either of type m50 or m55, or an m12 strain deficient in m-protein, protected mice against i.n. challenge with m50 streptococci (82, 88 and 83% survival, respectively). significant resistance against m50 streptococci was also noted by  i.n. application of heat-killed lactobacillus fermenti (81% survival) as well as  two strains of pneumococci (50 and 79% survival). in contrast, no protective effect was obtained using heat-killed trypsin-treated m55 streptococci. nor did vaccination with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa induce protection against type m50. thus, m protein was not required for immunity against type m50. the results call for a revision of the hitherto accepted view that m proteins are the only candidates for mucosal vaccines against group a streptococci.

TI  == differential binding of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus to corneal epithelium in culture.
AB  == adherence of bacteria to corneal epithelium is a prerequisite for corneal infection. we used two methods to study the binding of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus to rabbit corneal epithelial cells in culture. in the first method, rabbit corneal epithelial cells grown on glass slides were incubated with p. aeruginosa or s. aureus (10(7) cfu/ml) at room temperature for 90 min, and the bacterial binding to the epithelial cells was examined by light microscopy. both  p. aeruginosa and s. aureus bound to epithelial cells. p. aeruginosa was bound to the cell periphery whereas s. aureus was bound randomly to the cell surface. in the second method, suspension cultures of corneal epithelial cells were used. in  contrast to the findings in cultures on slides, binding pattern with cells in suspension was similar for both species and resembled that for s. aureus in cultures on slides. a much greater number of p. aeruginosa (186 +/- 11 bacteria/epithelial cell) than s. aureus (30 +/- 1.5 bacteria/epithelial cell) bound to epithelial cells grown on glass slides. in contrast, a similar number of p. aeruginosa (25 +/- 5.1) and s. aureus (20 +/- 4.7) bound to epithelial cells grown in suspension cultures. using either method, escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes did not bind significantly (less than 5/cell) to corneal epithelial cells. the above methods should prove useful for characterization of bacterial binding to corneal epithelial cells in culture.

AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in sendai city  during the period from march in 1988 to february in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. three hundred strains of potential (greater  than or equal to 10(7) cfu/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. many strains of staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. on the other hand many strains of branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. the sensitivity of 45  antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (eiken, japan). no strain of the haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. none of the streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. none of the staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. we conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
AB  == the dual-action antibacterial r 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. it was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (staphylococcus aureus 753, serratia marcescens sm and pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and streptococcus pyogenes. in prophylactic studies, ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against s. pyogenes, but ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against e. coli and more active than fleroxacin against s. pyogenes. in a murine pneumonia model, ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae. fleroxacin was inactive against s. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than ro 23-9424 against k. pneumoniae. in a murine meningitis infection caused by s. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was 3 times  as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. when meningitis was induced by k. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. in a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against p. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. in the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.

TI  == deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  == microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized s. pyogenes, s. aureus, and e. coli; ingestion of s. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. epidermidis was moderate. peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. to find  out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) or opsonized s. aureus. upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake  of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (sam), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with sam. the results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of s. epidermidis by these macrophages. the release of hydrogen peroxide by sam-pretreated peritoneal  macrophages upon stimulation with pma or opsonized s. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cefixime. a review of its antibacterial activity. pharmacokinetic properties and  therapeutic potential.
AB  == cefixime, previously designated fk027, fr17027 and cl284635, is an orally active  cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro. it is particularly active against many enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and branhamella catarrhalis, and is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. cefixime has little activity  against staphylococcus aureus and is inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefixime is distinguished by its 3-hour elimination half-life which permits twice daily, or in many instances once daily, administration. comparative trials, though few, indicate that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefixime 200 to 400mg daily administered as a single dose or in 2 divided doses, is comparable with that of multiple daily doses of co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) or amoxycillin in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection, with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections, and with that of amoxycillin and cefroxidine in adult patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. several comparative trials  in children with acute otitis media demonstrate the similar effectiveness of cefixime 8 mg/kg daily (in 2 divided doses, or as a single daily dose), cefaclor  20 to 40 mg/kg daily and amoxycillin 40 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses. the most  frequently reported adverse effects, diarrhoea and stool changes, are usually mild to moderate in severity, transient, and mostly occur in the first few days of treatment with cefixime. thus, cefixime is an effective orally active cephalosporin with a relatively long elimination half-life permitting a simplified treatment regimen. it is a suitable alternative to cefaclor or amoxycillin in acute otitis media and acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and to amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

(415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. iii. microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  == the coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. all microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. the mic90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine  are as follows: staphylococcus aureus 1.0, streptococcus pyogenes 8, enterobacteriaceae 2.0, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli 1, legionella pneumophila 8, haemophilus influenzae 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some peptostreptococcus strains. the aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, p. aeruginosa bmh 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (mic 0.2 micrograms/ml). coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for s.  aureus. the viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the mic (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. the frequency of resistance development was less than 1 x 10(-9) for escherichia coli and s. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the mic. the cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of  coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. coumamidine is stable in serum. in mouse protection tests against s. aureus nctc 10649 the ed50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. the antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.

TI  == pacidamycins, a novel series of antibiotics with anti-pseudomonas aeruginosa activity. iii. microbiologic profile.
AB  == pacidamycins are nucleosidyl-peptide antibiotics which have activity only against pseudomonas aeruginosa. their mics for other organisms such as enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, most streptococci and other pseudomonas species are greater than 100 micrograms/ml. these compounds had no activity against erythromycin-susceptible streptococci. the mics for streptococcus pyogenes with constitutive- and inducible-type of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance were 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mics against p. aeruginosa ranged from 8 to 64 micrograms/ml. the activity of these compounds was 1 to 2-fold less in serum than broth. time-kill curves were performed using 4 and 8 times the mic of pacidamycin 1. it  was bactericidal against p. aeruginosa (3 log10 decrease in 4 to 6 hours). at 24  hours, resistant mutants were found in the cultures. the mics of piperacillin and gentamicin for these mutants were the same as for the parent strain. the frequency of resistance to these compounds was less than 3.5 x 10(-6). the resistant mutants were stable after 10 transfers in antibiotic-free medium. the pacidamycins were inactive against p. aeruginosa in mouse protection test. after  a single subcutaneous injection of 25 mg/kg of pacidamycin 1, the cmax was approximately 50 micrograms/ml and the serum half-life was 0.5 hour.

(ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species. (vi) the most common bacteria among fastidious gram negative bacilli was haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) of these gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) n. meningitidis. (viii) the more common isolates of gram positive bacilli included bacillus species and corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) of these gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of staphylococcus species and streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. the most common isolate among gram positive cocci was staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then s. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). the less common isolates were streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and s. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == pharmacodynamics of beta-lactam antibiotics. studies on the paradoxical and postantibiotic effects in vitro and in an animal model.
AB  == the pharmacodynamics of antibiotics, i.e. the rate of killing and the time before regrowth of surviving bacteria, may be important factors for determination of the dosage interval. in the present study the effect of protein binding, antibiotic concentrations, bacterial growth phase and bacterial inoculum on the rate of bacterial killing was investigated. the postantibiotic effect (pae) was also studied in vitro and in vivo. the killing rate of s. aureus did not differ when the bacteria were exposed to the same free concentrations of dicloxacillin in medium with and without albumin. protein binding per se did thus not diminish the bactericidal activity. a paradoxically reduced bactericidal effect was noted when s. aureus was exposed to high concentrations of dicloxacillin, cloxacillin and benzylpenicillin. for determination of pae of imipenem on ps. aeruginosa, counts  of viable bacteria were compared with assay of bacterial intracellular atp. both  methods demonstrated a pae for the strains tested at an inoculum of 10(6) cfu/ml. at an inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml no pae was found, which coincided with a lack of bactericidal effect. both the pae and the bactericidal effect were restored with  aeration of the cultures, indicating insufficient penetration of imipenem to the  target sites at low oxygen tension. an in vivo model in rabbits with implanted tissue cages was developed for evaluation of the pae. group a beta-hemolytic streptococci showed a pae of approximately 2 h in vivo, which correlated well with the pae found in vitro. despite that streptococci in postantibiotic phase (pa-phase) were non-multiplying, such bacteria were killed as efficiently as previously untreated controls when exposed to 10xmic of penicillin both in vitro  and in vivo. however, streptococci in pa-phase were much more sensitive to the repeated challenge to subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin than previously  untreated controls. in vivo, no difference in sensitivity to sub-mic penicillin concentrations between streptococci in pa-phase and untreated controls was seen,  probably due to the presence of host factors in the tissue cage fluid. it seems that for streptococci, subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations are more important for the sucess with intermittent dosing than the pae, especially when a normal host defence is present.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence galnac beta 1-4gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  == pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the united states. to examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. the classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such  as streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-gm1 (fuc alpha 1-2gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4cer), asialo-gm1 (gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta-1-4galc beta 1-1cer), and asialo-gm2 (galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4glc beta 1-1cer). bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. they do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides gm1, gm2, gm3, gd1a, gd1b, gt1b, and cad. the finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked galnac, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-gm1 and asialo-gm1 and terminally in asialo-gm2, is required for binding. beta-n-acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence galnac beta 1-3gal. these data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal galnac beta 1-4gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. other bacteria,  including mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella species, and  some e. coli, do not bind to the galnac beta 1-4gal sequence. the biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-gm1 occur in human lung tissue.

AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae) is the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after limited exposure of organisms to antimicrobial agents. we demonstrated and standardized the in vivo pae in a thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.4-7.5 h against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, whereas beta-lactam antibiotics did not induce significant paes. against aerobic gram-positive cocci, cell wall-active agents and inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.2-7.1 h, except for penicillins, which did not induce paes against streptococci. with few exceptions the in vivo pae correlated well with the pae reported in prior in vitro studies. residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the pae. theoretically, the presence of a pae may allow antimicrobial agents to be given more intermittently without organism regrowth after drug levels fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == in vitro correlation of platelet aggregation with occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and subacute bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == platelet-bacterial interactions were examined in vitro by incubating organisms isolated from patients with septicemia with normal platelet-rich plasma. the potency of various species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to induce  irreversible platelet aggregation was then determined in an aggregometer. the aggregation curves produced by the bacteria resembled the normal platelet response to collagen and were impeded by the presence of aspirin. strains of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from 25 different patients produced maximum increases in light transmission and irreversible platelet aggregation with relatively rapid mean aggregation times; six of these patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. in contrast, isolates of alpha streptococcus and staphylococcus epidermidis induced irreversible platelet aggregation much less commonly and were associated with considerably longer mean aggregation times. none of the latter group of patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. isolates of bacteria from a small number of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis uniformly induced irreversible platelet aggregation. addition of paired bacterial isolates to normal platelet-rich plasma demonstrated a synergistic aggregation response. these data suggest that a relative hierarchy exists in bacterial strain potency to induce irreversible platelet aggregation. the rapidity and degree of aggregation in vitro correlated well with the clinical and laboratory evidence for subacute bacterial endocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in vivo. these observations may provide useful adjunctive laboratory information to help establish the diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in the clinical setting where the classical findings of endocarditis are not obvious during initial presentation.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of a-56619 (difloxacin) and a-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  == a-56619 and a-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae. a-56619 and a-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. infection with salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with a-56619 (50% effective dose [ed50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ed50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). e. coli or pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with a-56619 or a-56620 than with norfloxacin. after oral treatment, the  ed50s of a-56619 and a-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against e. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against e. coli or p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. a-56619 and a-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by e. coli and streptococcus faecalis. a-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and a-56620  was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against klebsiella pneumonia in mice. a-56619 and a-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. a-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas a-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. the peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of a-56619 and a-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. the serum hal-lives of a-56619 and a-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.

TI  == suppression of lymphocyte proliferation by pseudomonas aeruginosa: mediation by pseudomonas-activated suppressor monocytes.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to suppress cell-mediated immunity in experimental animals, but recent reports have also demonstrated that there is a strong t-cell response to this bacteria. our studies of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a great variation in the in vitro proliferative response to killed p. aeruginosa, so we examined the interaction of the different mononuclear cells in cultures with this bacteria. p. aeruginosa stimulated the proliferation of t lymphocytes, specifically the surface-immunoglobulin-negative, t8- subset, which are felt to be t helper cells. p. aeruginosa added in coculture experiments to peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, or tetanus toxoid suppressed the proliferation to these latter antigens. this proliferation was not affected by the depletion of adherent monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the suppression was restored when monocytes were added back to these cultures. moreover, monocytes pulsed with p. aeruginosa but not with s. aureus suppressed the antigen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. this monocyte suppression was not inhibited by indomethacin and was unlikely to be the result of prostaglandin synthesis by these cells. thus, p. aeruginosa can induce  monocytes to suppress antigen-stimulated t-lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, and these suppressor cells may facilitate the growth of this organism in disorders such as cystic fibrosis.

TI  == effect of antibiotics eliminated by first order kinetics.
AB  == we wanted to simulate the conditions within the body where bacteria are exposed to antibiotics at concentrations which diminish exponentially and thus do not remain constant as in the usual test systems for determination of the minimum inhibitory or bactericidal concentrations (mic, mbc). for this purpose we employed a model with a glass chamber containing a constant volume of culture which was supplied continuously with medium at a constant rate. we studied the pattern of bacterial response using a series of bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents added to the system at various multiples of the mic of several bacterial strains, and using different rates of elimination of the antibacterial agent. strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes were exposed to amoxicillin, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, chloramphenicol, flucloxacillin, gentamicin, or oxytetracyclin. the bacteria were killed or maintained at their initial density depending on the antibiotic and its concentration. the main findings were: for most drugs drop in bacterial number persisted while the concentration of the chamber remained above mic, a period of time elapsed before recovery and bacterial multiplication resumed at the same rate as in control cultures, the period of antibacterial postantibiotic effect lasted longer with gram-positive than with gram-negative species, the point in time when the bacteria resumed multiplication corresponded to the ic50. we observed only minor differences in the pattern of bacteria during exposure to potentially bactericidal agents compared to antibiotics with mainly bacteriostatic effects.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was determined for a broad spectrum of 1,234 organisms  isolated as part of a multiclinic study. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90 percent of strains tested (mic90) ranged from 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacteriaceae. mic90s were 0.015 and 0.06 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, respectively, and 4 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. the mic90 of cefmenoxime for neisseria gonorrhoeae and hemophilus influenzae was 0.06 microgram/ml. cefmenoxime was less active against  pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, and bacteroides fragilis (mic50 =  16 micrograms/ml).

[3h]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, dna was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. this suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial dna.

AB  == hr810 (hoechst-roussel pharmaceuticals inc., somerville, n.j.) is a new, cyclical-pyridinium cephalosporin that appeared superior to numerous comparison drugs against 658 strains of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. seventeen enterobacteriaceae spp. were tested by broth microdilution methods, and the 50% mics (mic50s) and 90% mics (mic90s) were 0.03 to 0.12 and 0.03 to 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. only one strain had an mic greater than 8.0 micrograms/ml (99.6% is considered susceptible). hr810 inhibited 98% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 for acinetobacter spp. was 4.0 micrograms/ml. it was also very active against pseudomonas spp. and staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) but marginally active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcal strains (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) and enterococcus (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml). non-enterococcal streptococci had mic50s ranging from 0.008 micrograms/ml for streptococcus pyogenes to 0.12 micrograms/ml for pneumococci. all mics of hr810 against haemophilus and neisseria spp. were less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml (mic50, 0.002 to 0.008 micrograms/ml). hr810 poorly inhibited beta-lactamases and was very stable against 11 tested beta-lactamases of plasmid (tem, oxa, shv-1, and pse) and chromosomal (k1, k14, p99) types.

TI  == an extended model for transfer of micro-organisms via the hands: differences between organisms and the effect of alcohol disinfection.
AB  == a model for contact transfer of micro-organisms by hand has been extended to include representatives of bacterial species responsible for a majority of hospital-acquired infections. the ability of the organisms to transfer from contaminated fabrics to hands and from hands to sterile fabrics was measured, as  was their ability to survive on the skin of the hands. there were differences between the species. staphylococcus saprophyticus transferred well to the hand but not as well from hand to fabric as the other species; it survived well on skin. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes and serratia marcescens transferred moderately well overall and also survived on the skin. these results  were in contrast to those obtained with a strain of escherichia coli and one of streptococcus pyogenes. the contact transfer model was used to investigate the use of small volumes of alcohol in preventing transfer via the hands. an alcohol  handrub of either 0.3 ml 80% ethanol or 0.3 ml 70% isopropanol gave reductions in transfer slightly less than that of a soap and water wash. raising the volume, and consequently the contact time, to 0.5 ml 70% isopropanol gave a 14000-fold reduction in transfer, statistically indistinguishable from that of a thorough soap and water wash (9800-fold reduction).

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm =  mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the  following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3  to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.

TI  == interbacterial adherence between actinomyces viscosus and strains of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == interbacterial adherence was sought between strains of actinomyces viscosus indigenous to the human mouth and strains of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. six of nine strains of s. pyogenes, three of five strains of s. agalactiae, and two of four strains of p. aeruginosa were found to coaggregate with each of five strains of a. viscosus tested. some coaggregation reactions were inhibited by 0.05 m lactose and were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive actinomyces components. such reactions appear to involve the galactosyl-binding adhesin previously described in type 2 fimbriae on a. viscosus. other coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the pathogen. that such pathogen  strains possessed an adhesin(s) was further suggested by the observation that they agglutinated human erythrocytes. the ability of coaggregation-positive and -negative strains of s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae to adhere to actinomyces-coated agarose beads was also studied. coaggregation-positive streptococcal strains attached in higher numbers to the actinomyces-coated beads  than did strains which were coaggregation negative. lactose (0.05 m) inhibited the attachment of those streptococcal strains which coaggregated with a. viscosus in a lactose-sensitive manner. the adherence of those streptococcal strains whose coaggregation appeared to depend upon the galactosyl-binding adhesin of a. viscosus was also reduced by components of human saliva. crude sonic extracts of  coaggregation-positive streptococci or of p. aeruginosa were also effective in aggregating actinomyces cells. the effect of lactose and of salivary components on this extract-induced aggregation of actinomyces cells generally paralleled that observed in other assays. the apparent prevalence and diversity of adherent  reactions between the pathogens studied and indigenous strains of a. viscosus suggest that some may affect host susceptibility to these infectious agents.

AB  == two hundred and ninety-six bacterial isolates were investigated for the effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on their susceptibility to ampicillin, tetracycline,  chloramphenicol and gentamicin. when the test organisms were primed with normal and 'diseased' saliva there were no observable differences in the mics of ampicillin and chloramphenicol for group-a streptococci, but alpha-amylase significantly reduced the mic of tetracycline from 2 to 0.25 mg/1. with staphyloccus aureus, priming with saliva and alpha-amylase had no effect on the mics of gentamicin and ampicillin, whereas the mics of tetracycline and chloramphenicol were increased. the effect of saliva on the susceptibility of e.  coli to tetracycline was also significant; mic50 and mic90 were reduced from 128  to 8 and 32 mg/1 respectively. chloramphenicol was however increased from less than 0.125 to 1 and 2 mg/1 when e. coli was primed with amylase and saliva respectively. the general significance of these observations is discussed.

TI  == enhancement of endotoxicity and reactivity with carbocyanine dye by sonication of lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == the specificity of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, lps) in the carbocyanine dye reaction was investigated, and then a stoichiometric study of the dye-lps interaction was conducted with attention to the relationship of biological activities of lps to the reactivity with the dye. absorption maxima of some bacterial components in the dye reaction were as follows; lps from both escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and lipid a from e. coli lps, 465 nm; shigella flexneri lps, 460 nm; salmonella minnesota r595 glycolipid, 470 nm; polysaccharide from e. coli lps, 650 nm; yeast rna, 620 nm; streptococcal m protein and pyrogenic exotoxin, 610 nm; and free fatty acids, 445-450 nm. the absorbance at 465 nm was increased approximately threefold by sonicating lps for  1-3 min, which roughly paralleled the decrease in turbidity of the lps aqueous solution. the limulus amoebocyte lysate (lal) gelation activity of lps increased  10-fold when lps was sonicated for 0.5-5 min, but it decreased to the control level after further treatment. this decrease, however, was overcome by sonication in the presence of 5 mmol of l-ascorbic acid used as an antioxidant. the lal gelation activity of lps was inactivated in parallel with an increase in the ratio (w/w) of dye to lps from 1.73 to 6.90 in the dye-lps mixture. pyrogenicity  of lps was also clearly inactivated when the ratio was over 1.73. the ratios of the height of the beta band at 465 nm (dye-lps complex) to that of the alpha band at 510 nm (free dye) were increased by sonicating lps, indicating that the binding character, or stacking tendency, was increased by sonicating lps.

TI  == general principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == the initial treatment of suspected life-threatening bacterial infection should be sufficiently broad to cover the likely causative agents. definitive therapy depends on microbial isolation, identification, and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. parenteral therapy should be used, at least initially, and  optimal doses are necessary. the dose is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered; a concern for potential side effects with use of these agents had engendered a tendency to administer inadequate doses. the problems leading to recurrence or persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group  d streptococci, and cryptococcus neoformans. laboratory assistance for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be valuable but is not always necessary because certain microorganisms--for example, streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes--have stable, predictable susceptibilities. cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. the compound showed moderate  activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. the mbc was usually equal to  or two- or fourfold higher than mic. medium composition, ph and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. about 50% of recent clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to mic or two- to fourfold higher. however, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. antagonism was never observed. human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86%  according to the assay method. binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.

AB  == human urine was studied in regard to precipitation of crystals under various experimental conditions. these included alkalization of the urine by adding naoh  or by inoculation with proteus bacteria. the contents of calcium and magnesium in the urinary supernatant after incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees c were significantly lower after inoculation with proteus bacteria than in noninoculated urine. microscopy of the sediments showed distinct crystalline aggregations after the bacterial inoculation. inoculation with killed proteus organisms did not lead to crystalline precipitation in otherwise identical experiments. the effect of other live bacteria was also studied. the mechanism of crystal formation in bacteria-inoculated urine is discussed.

TI  == clinical trials of cefotaxime for the treatment of bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  == the efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. the first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. a total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. in the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. the efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (p = 0.03). favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to proteus, enterobacter, and klebsiella species. cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. all serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for  pseudomonas isolates was wide.

TI  == ceftriaxone: in vitro activity against 410 bacterial isolates compared with cefotaxime.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the two new cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone,  against 410 bacterial isolates was compared using an agar dilution method. both compounds were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus and providencia; the great majority of the isolates were  inhibited by 0.06 mg/l of either drug. activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus was moderate, and enterococci were resistant. all streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to 0.03 mg/l of either drug. the isolates belonging to  the bacteroides fragilis group were inhibited over a wide range of concentrations and some were highly resistant (mic greater than or equal to 64 mg/l). there were no significant differences in the antibacterial activity of the two drugs against our isolates. both drugs may be of potential use in the treatment of serious infections caused by enterobacteriaceae; they may prove to be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides.

AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == the role of bacterial adherence in infection.
AB  == the data presented in this review indicate that bacteria have developed mechanisms to facilitate adherence to target mammalian cells, often present in filamentous structures of varying organization at the cell surface, classified together as adhesins. these may contain distinctive molecular sequences, often including sugars, which function as ligands for specific interactions with receptors on mammalian cells. such receptor-ligand interactions determine species, organ, and cell specificity of adherence by individual bacterial strains. in some examples, this adherence phenomenon can be demonstrated to be an essential virulence attributed of pathogens which must adhere in order to colonize and then cause disease. while considerable detailed knowledge has accumulated about certain adhesins (e.g., k-88) or some mammalian cell receptors  (e.g., the pk blood group-related disaccharide on human erythrocytes for pyelonephritis strains of e. coli), in no instance do we know the nature of an adhesin and its specific receptor to fully define the actual chemistry of the binding, but we undoubtedly will in the near future. avidity of adherence is attributable to multiple forces, in particular hydrophobic interactions in prokaryote-eukaryote systems. therapeutic strategies to alter these relationships and thereby to prevent or treat disease are already being applied to model in vitro and experimental in vivo infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephalosporins.
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined against 662 recent clinical isolates for eight cephalosporins representing first, second and third generation compounds. all four third-generation cephalosporins tested (cefoperaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam) were significantly more active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria than the older compounds (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime). cefotaxime and moxalactam  were most active against enterobacteriaceae with extremely low mic-values. ceftazidime was definitely most active against pseudomonas aeruginosa with more than 90% of strains inhibited at 4 micro g/ml. mic-values for cefotaxime against  staphylococcus aureus were for all strains 1-2 micro g/ml, slightly higher for cefoperazone, while the effect of ceftazidime and moxalactam was more limited. all third generation cephalosporins demonstrated efficiency against streptococcus pyogenes, cefotaxime being most active and moxalactam least active, but were essentially ineffective against streptococcus faecalis. moxalactam demonstrated higher activity against bacteroides fragilis than other second and third generation cephalosporins including cefoxitin. previous studies have demonstrated a very high activity of all third generation cephalosporins against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365).
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime  required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to  8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited  78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics  for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae  and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.

AB  == formocresol and eugenol are the two nonspecific intracanal medicaments commonly used in endodontic practice. both have high tissue irritation potential when used in conventional strength. propylene glycol is an alcohol that is injectable and itself possesses significant antibacterial action. it is a popular vehicle and hence was used to modify the two drugs. standard bacteriologic methods were employed to test the antibacterial action of these lower concentrations of the two drugs against four test organisms. the investigations indicate that formocresol at as low as 10 to 20% and eugenol at 75% are bactericidal in action  and hence may be useful at these concentrations for clinical use. evaluation of these lower concentrations is warranted for possible clinical use. propylene glycol, which possesses antibacterial action and is remarkably innocuous to tissues, appears to be a suitable vehicle for dilution of formocresol and eugenol.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == attempts to control clothes-borne infection in a burn unit, 2. clothing routines  in clinical use and the epidemiology of cross-colonization.
AB  == previous investigations have shown that cross-contamination in a burn unit is mainly clothes-borne. new barrier garments have been designed and tried experimentally. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of different clothing routines on cross-contamination. in a long-term study, the rates and routes of colonizations with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus groups a, b, c, f, and g and pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined. the exogenous  colonization rates were, with s. aureus 77%, with streptococcus species 52% and with ps. aeruginosa 32%. the colonization rate with ps. aeruginosa was higher in  patients with larger burns. patients dispersed streptococcus and ps. aeruginosa as well as s. aureus into the air of their rooms in considerable amounts, but dispersers were not more important as sources of cross-colonization than non-dispersers. in comparison of clothing routines, there was no difference in overall colonization rates. the newly designed barrier garment that was made from apparently particle-tight material did not reduce the transfer of bacteria from patient to patient. a less rigid routine than that previously used did not increase the risk of cross-contamination. a thorough change of barrier dress after close contact nursing delayed the first exogenous s. aureus colonization from day 6 to day 14 after admission. this routine might be recommended for clinical use. otherwise, methods must be developed for adequate selection of materials intended for barrier garments.

TI  == [therapy of chronic respiratory tract infections in children, including mucoviscidosis (author's transl)].
AB  == in respiratory tract infections in children a distinction must be made between frequently recurring infections and genuine chronic infections due to specific anatomical factors, immunological defects or congenital diseases such as mucoviscidosis. the most frequent pathogens are haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella, s. aureus predominates in infants. the same applies for mucoviscidosis, in which p. aeruginosa is the second most frequent pathogen, occurring frequently after a primary infection with staphylococci. in order to avoid frequent relapses in mucoviscidosis patients, uninterrupted long-term treatment with an antibiotic which is effective against staphylococci is recommended, commencing the moment the diagnosis has been established. suitable antibiotics are co-trimoxazole or oral cephalosporins (e. g. cephalexin, cephradine or cefaclor). other respiratory tract infections should be treated according to the antibiogramme with a suitable antibiotic once the diagnosis has been confirmed.

(1) pha active fraction which reacts most strongly with homologous serum was obtained from the sodium dodecyl sulfate soluble fraction of l-form membrane after disruption by braun cell homogenizer. (2) antiserum prepared against l-forms in rabbits showed high-level stimulation of pha antibodies, while it showed little stimulation of agglutinating antibodies. (3) in pha and agar gel diffusion tests, antiserum to l-form of p. aeruginosa strain ifo-3,455 reacted with l-form of strain n-10, which is serologically different in serotype from strain ifo-3,455. furthermore,  the two l-forms of p. aeruginosa cross-reacted with a l-form of s. pyogenes. 4) l-forms of p. aeruginosa and s. pyogenes did not react with five strains of mycoplasmas in pha and agar gel diffusion tests.

TI  == immunological method to differentiate between antigens of tubercle bacilli, other mycobacterial species, and non-acid-fast bacteria.
AB  == sera from rabbits immunized with sonicates of mycobacterium bovis bcg were passed through an immunoadsorbent made of a soluble bcg extract to make partially purified antibodies to bcg. these antibodies were in turn used to prepare an immunoadsorbent through which the bcg extract was passed. the partially purified  antigenic material was radiolabeled and subjected to electrophoresis in acrylamide gels. one of the radiolabeled fractions isolated (bcg-c) was found to  bind to antibodies to bcg and h37rv, but not to antibodies in sera from rabbits immunized with other mycobacterial species or nocardia asteroides. the reaction between bcg-c and the partially purified antibodies to bcg was inhibited by small amounts of different bcg antigens. cultures obtained from 25 patients with tuberculous diseases, other bacterial cultures, and various bacterial extracts were tested for their capacity to inhibit this reaction. each of 13 mycobacteria  identified as m. tuberculosis inhibited this reaction. equivalent numbers of 12 strains of mycobacteria other than m. tuberculosis and high concentrations of other bacterial extracts did not inhibit, indicating that determinants of bcg present in m. tuberculosis were not detected in the other mycobacteria or in non-acid-fast bacteria. the use of sequential purification procedures could be of potential clinical value in quickly differentiating between m. tuberculosis and a variety of other mycobacteria.

TI  == general principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == in the initial therapy of life-threatening infections in which a bacterial cause  is suspected, the emphasis should be on broad antibiotic coverage in contrast to  definitive therapy, which is dependent on microbial isolation and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. in severe infections, antimicrobial agents should be given parenterally, at least initially. the need for optimal dosage is emphasized. this is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered, for there is a tendency to use inadequate dosage because of concern for potential side effects with these agents. the problems leading to recurrence  and persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections in severe  infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group d streptococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, and cryptococcus neoformans. laboratory aid for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be of great value but need not always be done, because certain microorganisms have stable, predictable susceptibilities, for example, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  == tobramycin: a review of its antibacterial and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
AB  == synopsis: tobramycin is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum in vitro, and pharmacokinetic properties similar to those  for gentamicin. tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and active against many gentamicin resistant strains, but is not active against enterobacteriaceae resistant to gentamicin. theoretically, tobramycin has an advantage over gentamicin against infections caused by p. aeruginosa, but any advantage in clinical practice has yet to be adequately demonstrated. clinical experience with tobramycin is considerably less than with  gentamicin. whilst tobramycin appears to offer no clear advantages over gentamicin against sensitive organisms it is indicated in infection caused by strains of p. aeruginosa which are resistant to gentamicin, but sensitive to tobramycin. like gentamicin, tobramycin acts synergistically with corbenicillin and the cephalosporins. the efficacy of the tobramycin-carbenicillin combination  has been shown in endocarditis caused by p. aeruginosa which was unresponsive to  gentamicin plus carbenicillin. ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity similar to that seen with other animoglycosides have been encountered in therapeutic trials with  tobramycin and wider clinical experience is necessary to determine the relative incidence of these side-effects with gentamicin and tobramycin used under similar conditions. antimicrobial activity: in comparative studies, in vitro, tobramycin  is more active than gentamicin against clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. similarly, the inhibitory index, which is the ratio between the serum concentration attained at usual therapuetic doses and the minimum inhibitory concentration, for pseudomonas aeruginosa is higher for tobramycin than for gentamicin. against gram-negative bacteria other than pseudomonas spp. the spectrum of activity of tobramycin is similar to that of gentamicin. for most species the activity of tobramycin is slightly less than that of gentamicin. gentamicin is consistently more active than tobramycin against serratia marcescens. like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, tobramycin is active in vitro  in low concentrations against staphylococcus aureus. tobramycin is essentially inactive against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). maner aminoglycosides and of other antibiotics against  various bacteria in vitro, but comparisons between studies cannot always be interpreted literally because the activity of many antibiotics in vitro, including tobramycin, is influenced by the nature of the culture media and the presence of certain salts. the sensitivity of p. aeruginosa to tobramycin is influenced by the magnesium, and calcium content of the culture media whilst that of all species is reduced by sodium ions. wide variations in the concentration of these ions may result in divergent mic values and an inappropriate choice of antibacterial agent to treat pseudomonas infection...

AB  == an extracellular bacteriocidal substance is produced by a serotype c strain of streptococcus mutans in liquid meduim during the stationary phase of growth. the  lethal effect of the substance was demonstrated by the decrease in viable counts  of a standardized suspension of group a streptococci in broth. no lysis of affected cells was observed and no changes in appearance of these cells was seen  in electron micrographs. the material was effective against certain strains of immmunological groups a, c, d, g, h, l, and o streptococci. it was inactive against strains of s. mutans belonging to the a, b, c, and d serotypes, bacillus  subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. the factor was purified 273-fold from the culture fluid by column chromatography. it was sensitive to trysin and pronase and resistant to catalase. it possessed a  molecular weight of more than 20,000 and was not dialyzable. the properties of this substance indicate that it is a bacteriocin. group a streptococci, which had been treated with antiserum specific for the cell wall group and type antigens, were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcal strains resistant to the lethal action of the bacteriocin adsorbed the bacteriocin from the solutions, as  did the sensitive cells. the bacteriocin was not adsorbed at 0 c.

AB  == gentamycin prepared at the all-union research institute of antibiotics did not differ by its antibacterial spectrum and the activity level from gentamycin samples from other countries. by its activity against clinical strains of ps. aeruginosa gentamycin was somewhat inferior than polymyxin but much more superior than carbenicillin. an agar-diffusion method using bac. pumilus ntcc 8241 as the  test microbe was developed for determination of gentamycin activity. the gentamycin sulfate complex and the components of gentamycin had the same activity levels, antibacterial spectrum and diffusion capacity.

TI  == endophthalmitis following cataract extraction. a study of 24 cases in 4,498 operations.
AB  == the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis in a series of 4,498 consecutive cataract operations, performed in a period of 10 years, was examined and found to equal 0.533%. paracentesis of the anterior chamber was done in two cases and revealed staphylococcus albus to be the causative organism in both instances. conjunctival cultures were recovered in a further 17 cases, and showed s. albus in pure culture in eight cases and in combination with pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteous morgani in two cases. streptococcus haemolyticus was isolated in pure culture in one case, while the cultures from six other patients were negative. the role of such factors as age, diabetes mellitus, chronic bronchitis, "weak ocular tissue", and persurgical complications which predisposed to postoperative  infections was examined and found to have no significance on the occurrence of endophthalmitis in the present study. the visual end results were assessed and showed a better prognosis than generally expected. of 24 cases, five achieved good visual acuity (6/6-6/12), 13 had a useful vision (6/18-6/60), while five remained actually blind (less than 6/60). in only one case was the eye enucleated. methods of treatment and prophylaxis are described and discussed. a total suppression or elimination of all regional bacteria at the time of surgery  seems to be the logical goal.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == interference with alpha-antitrypsin studues in stored serum by presumed bacterial proteases.
AB  == contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (stic) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the stic has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. cultures of enterobacter, klebsiella,  bacillus subtilis, and pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in  the presence of human serum. the enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the stic. care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an sticassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.

TI  == the effect of some bacterial products on temperature and sleep in rat.
AB  == the lipopolysaccharides from p. aeruginosa, s. minnesota and mucopeptide from streptococcus group a injected intravenously into rats induce a dose-dependent changes of temperature. simultaneously, a profound disturbance of sleep occurs. the administration of salicylate, which markedly suppressed the fever does not influence the mucopeptide-caused sleep disturbance. the most prominent change in  the sleep pattern is a marked decrease of the total time of paradoxical sleep. the measurement of turnover rates of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) and noradrenaline (na) in hypothalamus and midbrain, areas involved in temperature and sleep control, after injection of streptococcal mucopeptide demonstrated a significant  increase of 5-ht turnover in both areas during fever and paradoxical sleep deprivation. small electrolytic lesions of the dorsal raphe nuclei which are the  largest collection of neural cells containing 5-ht completely eliminated the pyrogenic potency of mucopeptide. the findings suggest that some bacterial products might increase the body temperature through the interference with activity of 5-ht-containing neurons of the raphe complex.

TI  == the varying sensitivity to antibacterial agents of micro-organisms in pure vs. mixed cultures.
AB  == in this study the disc sensitivities of five organisms growing in pure cultures (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans) were first determined against each  of seven antibacterial agents (penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, silver nitrate, sulfamylon, and betadine). then the sensitivity of each organism  growing in combination with one of the others (10 combinations) was tested against each of the same antibacterials. significantly increased and decreased sensitivities were found in 30 percent of the cultures with decreases largely predominating. total obliteration of all sensitivity occurred 10 percent of the time. the changes in sensitivity were not distributed randomly but rather were associated more with particular agents and organisms. sulfamylon, was associated  with decreases 70 percent of the time with sensitivity obliteration in 50 percent of the tests. streptococcus led all the organisms, being associated with decreases in half of the tests. it is possible that mixed-culture sensitivities could provide the most valid information when mixed infections exist, since they  more closely simulate the real clinical situation. therefore it is suggested that both mixed and pure culture sensitivity testing be done for all mixed infections.

AB  == comparative plate counts were made of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes growing on blood agar supplemented with individual chemicals to abolish  the swarming of proteus. b-phenylethanol, sodium azide, and p-nitrophenyl glycerin (pnpg) were used as anti-swarm agents. each anti-swarm agent effectively abolished swarming for 24 h, but azide failed to control swarming for longer periods of incubation. in addition, azide displayed growth inhibition towards the staphylococci and streptococci resulting in no hemolysis and reduced viable cell  numbers with the streptococci. phenylethanol showed reduced viable cell numbers with the streptococci and unreliable hemolytic reactions. at 0.1 to 0.3 mm, pnpg  proved to be a superior anti-swarm agent in that it showed no growth inhibition and allowed normal hemolysis, but abolished swarming for extended periods of time. when laboratory strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa. listeria monocytogenes, and vibrio cholerae were screened on a blood agar medium containing 0.1 mm pnpg, they displayed similar growth and  hemolytic characteristics to the identical medium without pnpg.

TI  == media exchange method for demonstrating killing of l-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  == normal human serum has been shown to kill l-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. this failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and nacl. a method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some l-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the l-phase variants of staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi. this method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for l-phase variants.

AB  == epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. these included single strains of streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, salmonella schottmuelleri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. in oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. the concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.

TI  == epicillin: in vitro laboratory studies.
AB  == a new semisynthetic penicillin, structurally related to ampicillin, has been assigned the generic name epicillin, 6-[d-2-amino-2-(1, 4-cyclohexadienyl) acetamido]-penicillanic acid. the antimicrobial spectrum and level of activity of epicillin in vitro are similar to those of ampicillin. in studies with recent clinical isolates, these two antibiotics, when compared with carbenicillin, showed consistently higher antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and proteus species. when tested against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, on the other hand, epicillin exhibited a level of intrinsic activity superior to that of ampicillin but less than that of  carbenicillin. epicillin is an amphoteric substance that is sensitive to penicillinase, is acid-stable, and is minimally, but reversibly, bound to human serum protein.

TI  == the effect of a changed environment on bacterial colonization rates in an established burns centre.
AB  == in an established burns centre which moved from an old building to new purpose-designed premises, colonization rates of patients' burns with staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli were not reduced. colonization rates with streptococcus pyogenes increased but the increase was mainly due to multiple importations in the new premises of a strain of higher communicability than any seen in the old.in the first 32 months  in the new environment 10 patients were found colonized with pseudomonas on admission and 20 became colonized in the unit. a much higher proportion of patients with burns of more than 30% body surface became colonized than of patients with less. about one-third of the above 20 patients became colonized with strains already isolated from another patient; all but one of them had small area burns. cross-infection was not observed from numerous heavily colonized patients with high percentage burns. this paradox is discussed in detail. basin outflows in the new premises became colonized with p. aeruginosa of two serotypes not found on patients in this unit.

TI  == in vitro action of carbenicillin against bacteria isolated from clinical material.
AB  == more than 500 bacteria isolated from patient material were tested against carbenicillin (disodium alpha-carboxybenzylpenicillin) by diffusion and dilution  modalities. the same bacteria, which included pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella-aerobacter-enterobacter group, various species of proteus, staphylococcus aureus and epiddermidis, enterococci, pneumococci, streptococcus pyogenes, etc., were examined for susceptibility to other antibiotics commonly used with special emphasis on ampicillin and cephalothin. the responses of pyocine-typed p. aeruginosa were the most remarkable. the majority of these bacteria displayed susceptibility to carbenicillin by both the dilution and the diffusion techniques. the concentrations of this antibiotic used in the laboratory were of the same order of magnitude as that of the other drugs. the laboratory behavior of the other bacteria, toward this new semisynthetic penicillin derivative approximated their response to ampicillin and cephalothin.

TI  == antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  == a series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in other  comparative laboratory tests against p. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. an examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. the compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. results of studies with a cell-free p. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for p. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

TI  == effects of indomethacin on acute, subacute, and latent infections in mice and rats.
AB  == the comparative effect of indomethacin and hydrocortisone on the resistance of mice or rats to various acute, subacute, and latent bacterial infections was investigated. large daily doses of indomethacin and hydrocortisone administered to mice challenged with bacterial pathogens, including klebsiella pneumoniae ad,  salmonella schottmuelleri 3010, staphylococcus aureus (smith), streptococcus pyogenes c203, salmonella pullorum #2, proteus vulgaris 1810, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2616, revealed that in essentially all of these acute infections, the  mortality of the infected mice treated with indomethacin was essentially identical to that found in the infected controls. in contrast, hydrocortisone often lowered the resistance of mice to these acute infections. in a more chronic bacterial infection due to corynebacterium kutscheri, hydrocortisone produced striking deleterious effects on resistance, whereas indomethacin administration in doses approaching the maximal tolerated level caused no observable adverse effects on host resistance. indomethacin fed continuously to rats for 80 days, at maximal tolerated levels, caused no observable adverse effects on the host-parasite relationship of rats which were shown to harbor various latent infections. hydrocortisone administration, however, lowered the resistance of rats as evidenced by increased mortality related directly to extensive bacterial  infection. insofar as infection is concerned, indomethacin behaved like other nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin and phenylbutazone.

TI  == role of the phagocyte in host-parasite interactions. xii. hydrogen peroxide-myeloperoxidase bactericidal system in the phagocyte.
AB  == an antimicrobial system in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) consisting of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide has been proposed. this system appears to be activated during phagocytosis as a result of the stimulated metabolic activities. a lysed-granules (lg) fraction was prepared from guinea pig exudative pmn. lg alone possessed bactericidal activity which was related to the ph of the  reaction; the lower the ph, the more marked the activity. when low concentrations of both h(2)o(2) and lg were combined under conditions where neither factor alone exhibited significant killing power, there was a striking increase in bactericidal activity. this enhanced activity was much greater than an additive effect. the lg-peroxide antibacterial system was most active over a ph range of 4.0 to 6.0. the activity of the lg-peroxide system was essentially abolished by peroxidase inhibitors, nan(3), kcn, and aminotriazole. the antibacterial activity of this system was nonspecific in nature, being equally effective against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
