TI  == the cultivable microbiota of primary and secondary infected root canals, their susceptibility to antibiotics and association with the signs and symptoms of infection.
AB  == aim: to examine the presence of microbial species in primary and secondary infections and identify the signs and symptoms associated with them. methodology: a total number of 37 root canals from 33 patients undergoing root canal treatment were selected. samples were taken using a sterile paper point following chemomechanical canal instrumentation. microbiological identification was performed by macromorphological, micromorphological, and commercial biochemical tests (atb system). the antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolated enterococcus, streptococcus and propionibacterium spp. was evaluated. results: a  total number of 54 species were isolated. the most common was e. faecalis followed by propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus spp. five multidrug-resistant enterococcal strains were isolated. however, resistance to linezolid or glycopeptides was not found. radiolucency was observed significantly more often in symptomatic infections (p=0.0061) caused by actinomyces spp. than in asymptomatic ones. conclusions: enterococci and streptococci were the most commonly isolated bacteria from root canals. the resistance of enterococci to many antimicrobials may pose a problem in their eradication. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == a derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a highly selective against propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a chemical derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a, designated nai003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few gram-positive bacteria. in particular, nai003 retained low mics against all tested isolates of propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, nai003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive p. acnes isolate. gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, nai003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (ef) tu derived from escherichia coli, e. faecalis  or p. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. in contrast, ef-tu's derived from the nai003-insenstitive staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. these results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that nai003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the p. acnes ef-tu. p. acnes mutants resistant to nai003 were isolated by direct plating. with one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding ef-tu. because of its selective effect on p. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, nai003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a phase 1 clinical study.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16s rrna gene clone library analysis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. methodology: apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the  kyushu university hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. dna was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16s rrna gene. enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and specific fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis with specific primers. results: bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were p. gingivalis (19.9%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and propionibacterium acnes (9%). bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. in addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: prevotella spp., treponema spp., peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113, olsenella uli, slackia exigua, selemonas infelix, p. gingivalis with type iv fima, and a combination of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113 and predominance of streptococcus spp. on the other hand, neither enterococcus faecalis nor c. albicans were detected in any of the samples. conclusion: whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the  persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. the diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.

TI  == safety of topical vancomycin for pediatric spinal deformity: nontoxic serum levels with supratherapeutic drain levels.
AB  == study design: retrospective cohort analysis. objective: to establish if drain levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for common pathogens (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes-2 mug/ml; staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis-4 mug/ml). evaluate the safety of topical vancomycin in pediatric patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery and determine if postoperative serum levels approach toxicity (25 mug/ml). summary of background data: the application of topical vancomycin powder has decreased postoperative wound infections in retrospective analyses in the adult population  with minimal local and systemic risks. the safety and efficacy of vancomycin powder has not been completely evaluated in the pediatric population after deformity surgery. methods: topical vancomycin powder (1 g) was applied during wound closure after instrumented posterior spinal fusion. all patients received intravenous perioperative antibiotics and a subfascial drain was used. serum and  drain vancomycin levels were collected immediately postoperatively and during the first 2 postoperative days (pods). complications were recorded. results: the study population consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 13.5 years (9.5-17.1 yr) and mean +/- standard deviation body weight of 44.5 +/- 18 kg. underlying diagnoses included: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (12), neuromuscular scoliosis (10), and kyphosis (3). mean serum vancomycin levels trended downward from 2.5 mug/ml (pod 0) to 1.9 mug/ml (pod 1) to 1.1 mug/ml (pod 2). mean drain levels also trended downward from 403 mug/ml (pod 0) to 251 mug/ml (pod 1) to 115 mug/ml (pod 2). no vancomycin toxicity or deep wound infections were observed. one patient with neuromuscular scoliosis developed a superficial wound dehiscence that was managed with dressing changes. conclusion: topical application of vancomycin powder in pediatric spinal deformity surgery produced local levels well above the minimum inhibitory concentration for common pathogens and serum levels below the toxicity threshold (25 mug/ml). there were no deep wound or antibiotic related complications. level of evidence: 3.

TI  == postoperative spine and veptr infections in children: a case-control study.
AB  == background: surgical site infection (ssi) after pediatric scoliosis surgery is a  major cause of morbidity. we compared the odds ratios of various potential risk factors for infection among patients who developed a deep ssi following spinal deformity surgery and those who remained infection free. methods: this was a case-control study, not a matched study. more noninfection cases (50) than infection cases (20) were selected because more were available. twenty children with a deep ssi after scoliosis surgery were compared with 50 similar children who did not develop a deep ssi. fourteen perioperative factors were examined in both the groups. results: of the 20 patients who had a deep ssi, 14 had neuromuscular scoliosis. in the infected group, 6 patients had undergone vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib placement, 2 had undergone growing rod insertion, and 12 had undergone posterior spinal fusion. eighteen patients developed a ssi within 1 year of the operation and 2 patients presented with a ssi >1 year after surgery. sixteen patients had positive cultures. majority were  skin flora: coagulase-negative staphylococcus (8) and propionibacterium acnes (4). both patients with tracheostomies had enterococcus faecalis infections. when comparing the 20 patients with deep ssi to the 50 controls, increased preoperative cobb angle (p=0.011), increased postoperative cobb angle (p=0.0043), nonambulatory status (p=0.0002), and increased length of stay (p=0.015) were associated with significantly increased odds of infection. conclusions: our study shows that patients with neuromuscular scoliosis are at higher risk of developing a deep ssi after spinal deformity surgery. skin flora is a common cause of deep ssi. we have now instituted a standard skin preparation protocol to include alcohol and chlorhexidine washes the night before and the morning of surgery. we  have altered our prophylactic antibiotic regimen to cover skin flora in all patients and gastrointestinal flora in patients with a tracheostomy. we have counseled the families of nonambulatory children with large neuromuscular curves  regarding the significantly increased odds of postoperative deep ssi. level of evidence: level iii.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == tunel analysis of dna fragmentation in mouse unfertilized oocytes: the effect of  microorganisms within human follicular fluid collected during ivf cycles.
AB  == recently we reported the presence of bacteria within follicular fluid. previous studies have reported that dna fragmentation in human spermatozoa after in vivo or in vitro incubation with bacteria results in early embryo demise and a reduced rate of ongoing pregnancy, but the effect of bacteria on oocytes is unknown. this study examined the dna within mouse oocytes after 12 hours' incubation within human follicular fluids (n=5), which were collected from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. each follicular fluid sample was cultured to detect the presence of bacteria. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick-end labeling (tunel) was used to label dna fragmentation in ovulated, non-fertilized mouse oocytes following in vitro incubation in human follicular fluid. the bacteria streptococcus anginosus and peptoniphilus spp., lactobacillus gasseri (low-dose), l. gasseri (high-dose), enterococcus faecalis, or propionibacterium acnes were detected within the follicular fluids. the most severe dna fragmentation was observed in oocytes incubated in the follicular fluids containing p. acnes or l. gasseri (high-dose). no dna fragmentation was observed in the mouse oocytes incubated in the follicular fluid containing low-dose l. gasseri or e. faecalis. low human oocyte fertilization rates (<29%) were associated with extensive fragmentation in mouse oocytes (80-100%). bacteria colonizing human follicular fluid in vivo may cause dna fragmentation in mouse oocytes following 12h of in vitro incubation. follicular fluid bacteria may result in poor quality oocytes and/or embryos, leading to poor ivf outcomes.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of metapex (calcium hydroxide with iodoform formulation) at different concentrations against selected microorganisms--an in vitro study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess, in vitro, the effectiveness of several concentrations of metapex (0.22 gm/ml, 0.022 gm/ml, 0.0022 gm/ml) in the elimination of selected microorganisms. different concentrations of metapex were  prepared by dissolving it in ethanol (99.9%) pre-sterilized whatman paper discs,  6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar petri plates. plates were incubated aerobically for enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) and candida albicans (c. albicans), anaerobically for bacteroid fragilis (b. fragilis) and propionibacterium acne respectivally. a zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analysed statistically. there was significant reduction in the size of zone  of inhibition against p. acne, as the concentration of metapex decreases. at lower concentrations of metapex there was no zone of inhibition observed against  e. faecalis, c. albicans and b. fragilis. the result of this study suggested that metapex is a potent antimicrobial agent at higher concentration.

TI  == microbial spectrum and resistance patterns in endophthalmitis: a 21-year (1988-2008) review in northeast united states.
AB  == purpose: to study the microbial spectrum and antibacterial susceptibility of vitreous cultures in a tertiary referral center in northeast united states. methods: all vitreous samples sent to the microbiology laboratory at a tertiary referral center from january 1988 to december 2008 were included in the study. the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates from culture-positive samples were compared across 3 equal time periods 1988-1994, 1995-2001, and 2002-2008. results: one hundred forty-three positive cultures, where 11.9% (n=17) were polymicrobial, yielded a total of 160 isolates that consisted of 80.6% (n=129) gram-positive isolates, 12.5% (n=20) gram-negative isolates, and 6.9% (n=11) fungal isolates. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons) (37.5%, n=60), viridans streptococcus (11.3%, n=18), and streptococcus pneumoniae (6.9%, n=11). other common gram-positive isolates include propionibacterium acnes (5.6%, n=9), other streptococcus species (4.4%, n=7), staphylococcus aureus (4.4%, n=7), and enterococcus faecalis (3.8%, n=6). the most common gram-negative isolates were klebsiella species (3.1%, n=5), moraxella species (3.1%, n=5), and haemophilus species (2.5%, n=4). vancomycin was effective against all cons, sta. aureus, viridans streptococcus, and e. faecalis tested, and all sta. aureus isolates were oxacillin sensitive. of all cons isolates, 83.3% during 1988-1994, 73.1% during 1995-2001, and 100% during 2002-2008 were resistant to at least 1 of the antibiotics tested in the study with the last time period showing an increase in  resistance (p=0.021, adjusted standard residual=2.0). cons showed a decreasing resistance over time to chloramphenicol and gentamicin (p=0.010, p=0.007, respectively) and an increase in resistance to penicillin and tetracycline during 2002-2008 (p=0.003, p=0.040, respectively). susceptibility to other antibiotics did not show significant dependence on time. conclusion: bacteria causing endophthalmitis showed variable resistance to antibiotics over time. the importance of adequately treating endophthalmitis in the setting of these resistance pattern changes stresses the importance of periodic evaluation of causative organisms to ensure appropriate empiric treatment.

TI  == in vitro inactivation of endodontic pathogens with nd:yag and er:yag lasers.
AB  == both nd:yag and er:yag lasers have been suggested as root canal disinfection aids. the aim of this in vitro study is to compare both wavelengths in terms of irradiation dose required for microbial inactivation, to quantify these irradiation doses and to investigate the influence of certain (laser) parameters  on the antimicrobial efficacy. agar plates containing a uniform layer of enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans or propionibacterium acnes were mounted perpendicularly underneath the laser handpieces (5 mm spot). the er:yag laser was operated in single-pulse mode. pulse energies of 40-400 mj and pulse lengths of 100, 300, 600, and 1,000 mus were tested. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 h, growth on the plates was scored. the pulse energy yielding complete absence of growth over the entire spot area was taken as the total inhibition threshold (tit). tits were determined for every species and pulse length. the nd:yag laser  was operated with pulse trains because single pulses were ineffective. output power was 15 w and frequency was 100 hz. spots were irradiated for 5-120 s. after incubation, the diameters of the inhibition zones were measured. for the er:yag laser, tits varied between 100 and 210 mj, and differed significantly between species and pulse lengths. using nd:yag irradiation, tits were around 5,300 j/cm(2) for c. albicans and 7,100 j/cm(2) for p. acnes. no inhibition was observed for e. faecalis. er:yag irradiation was superior to nd:yag in inactivating microorganisms on agar surfaces.

TI  == [clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in bactec9240 blood culture system].
AB  == background: continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (ttp). we evaluated the clinical relevance of ttp in the bactec9240 system (becton-dickinson, usa). methods: a total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. ttp was monitored from each of bactec plus aerobic/f (bd) or pediatric plus/f and lytic anaerobic/f bottles,  and the differential time-to-positivity (dtp) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. results: the average ttp of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. while the average ttp values for aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, acinetobacter baumannii, and streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for candida spp., anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium spp, bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3  hr, respectively. the negative predictive values of ttp over 24 hr to predict staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and s. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis showed shorter ttp in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. dtp of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp. conclusions: ttp can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. the shorter ttp in anaerobic vials of certain enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. dtp is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp.

TI  == evaluation of the epinecidin-1 peptide as an active ingredient in cleaning solutions against pathogens.
AB  == we tested the activity of epinecidin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide structurally related to pleurocidin, in commercial cleaning solutions stored at 4 and 25 degrees c for 7 and 14 days. the peptide's activities against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were measured in a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination, minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) determination, disk diffusion test, and a count  of the bacterial numbers. exposure to epinecidn-1 in a cleaning solution following mic value comparisons in the disk diffusion test and counts of bacterial numbers after 16, 24, 48, and 72 h suggested that bacterial numbers were much lower than those treated with only commercial cleaning solutions for all bacteria. the efficacy of the antimicrobial activities of inhibiting bacterial numbers by epinecidin-1 in cleaning solutions at a low ph and a low temperature was not affected. given its simple structure and antimicrobial activity, epinecidin-1 may be a useful component of microbicides designed to prevent pathogen infections and/or remediate abnormal vaginal or skin flora.

TI  == sonication is superior to scraping for retrieval of bacteria in biofilm on titanium and steel surfaces in vitro.
AB  == background and purpose: low-virulence implant infections are characterized by bacterial colonization of the implant with subsequent biofilm formation. in these cases, soft tissue biopsies often prove to be culture negative. consequently, detachment of the causative adherent bacteria is crucial for correct microbiological diagnosis. using an in vitro model, we compared 4 methods of biofilm sampling from metal surfaces. methods: discs of titanium and steel were incubated in the presence of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and propionibacterium acnes in mueller hinton broth. non-adherent bacteria were removed by repeated rinsing of the discs. 10 parallels of each disc were subjected to 1 of 4 methods for bacterial recovery: (a) sonication of the discs, (b) scraping of the discs using surgical blades followed by streaking of the blades onto agar plates, (c) scraping of the discs followed by vortex mixing of the surgical blades, and (d) scraping of the discs followed by sonication of the surgical blades. quantitative bacterial cultures were performed for each sampling method. results: with the exception of s. epidermidis on steel, sonication efficiently and reliably dislodged biofilm bacteria. the scraping methods employed did not detach bacteria embedded in biofilm. interpretation: scraping of metal surfaces is not an adequate method for sampling of biofilm bacteria in vitro.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of enterocins from enterococcus faecalis sl-5 against propionibacterium acnes, the causative agent in acne vulgaris, and its therapeutic effect.
AB  == a lactic acid bacterial strain was isolated from human fecal specimen and identified as enterococcus faecalis sl-5. the isolated strain showed antimicrobial activity against gram-positive pathogens assayed, especially the highest activity against propionibacterium acnes. the antimicrobial substance was purified and verified as a bacteriocin (named esl5) of e. faecalis sl-5 by activity-staining using p. acnes as an indicator. n-terminal sequence of esl5 was determined (mgaiaklvak) and sequence analysis revealed that it is almost identical to the some of enterocins including l50a/b of e. faecium l50 and mr10a/b of e. faecalis mrr 10-3. from the sequencing data of l50a/b structural genes, the nucleotide sequence showed 100% identity with that of the mr10a/b structural genes, implying that esl5 is an equivalent of enterocin mr10. meanwhile, we also tested the therapeutic effect of anti-p. acnes activity in patients with mild to moderate acne because of its pathogenic role to acne vulgaris. for this purpose, a concentrated powder of cbt sl-5 was prepared using  cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of e. faecalis sl-5 and included in a lotion for application in the patients. the study showed that cbt sl-5 lotion significantly reduced the inflammatory lesions like pustules compared to the placebo lotion. therefore our results indicate that the anti-p. acnes activity produced by e. faecalis sl-5 has potential role to the treatment of acne as an alternative to topical antibiotics.

TI  == assessment of the bacterial diversity of human colostrum and screening of staphylococcal and enterococcal populations for potential virulence factors.
AB  == in contrast to breast milk, little is known about the bacterial composition of human colostrum. the objective of this work was to analyze the bacterial diversity of colostrum obtained from healthy women and to characterize the dominant bacterial species for the presence of possible virulence factors. samples of colostrum obtained from 36 healthy women were inoculated into different culture media. several isolates from each medium were selected and identified. staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling. one representative of each profile was included in a genetic and phenotypic characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits/genes and sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were the dominant species, followed by streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus lugdunensis. among the 48 s. epidermidis isolates selected on the basis of their genetic profiles, the biofilm-related icad gene and the meca gene were detected in only 11 and six isolates, respectively. in parallel, 10 enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cyla, vana, vanb, vand, vane and vang genes. all of them were sensitive to vancomycin. there were no indications that the colostrum samples contained harmful bacteria.

TI  == cbt-sl5, a bacteriocin from enterococcus faecalis, suppresses the expression of interleukin-8 induced by propionibacterium acnes in cultured human keratinocytes.
AB  == propionibacterium acnes is known to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris. cbt-sl5 is one of the antimicrobial peptides from enterococcus faecalis sl5, and it has shown antimicrobial activity against p. acnes. the aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of cbt-sl5 on the inflammation induced by p. acnes in cultured human keratinocyes. cultured human keratinocytes derived from neonatal foreskin were treated with heatkilled p. acnes to induce inflammation, and then various concentrations of cbt-sl5 were added to the p. acnestreated keratinocytes. the mrna expression and protein secretion of interleukin (il)-8, an inflammation marker, was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. we also analyzed the nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) p65 translocation by performing immunofluorescent staining. p. acnes  treatment upregulated the il-8 mrna expression in the keratinocytes, and this was brought about through both toll-like receptor (tlr)2 and tlr4. at the concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 ng/ml, cbt-sl5 significantly downregulated the  p. acnes-induced il-8 mrna expression and protein production (p<0.05). at 6 h and 12 h of the treatment, cbt-sl5 significantly suppressed the p. acnesinduced il-8  mrna expression. secretion of il-8 protein was significantly reduced at 24 h. the functional inhibitory activity of cbt-sl5 was shown by cbt-sl5 suppressing the p. acnes-induced nf-kappab translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. these results demonstrated that cbt-sl5 suppressed the p. acnes-induced il-8 expression in keratinocytes. therefore, cbt-sl5 may be a novel anti-inflammatory treatment for acne.

TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

TI  == effects of er:yag laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
AB  == with the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use er:yag lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. we examined their effects against biofilms  made of actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, propionibacterium acnes, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, or prevotella nigrescens in vitro. after er:yag laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 j/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. the er:yag laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by l. casei. after irradiation, the  numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. er: yag lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections associated with symptomatic teeth. samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 symptomatic (n = 30) or asymptomatic (n = 30) single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in symptomatic cases were fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, veillonella parvula, treponema socranskii, enterococcus faecalis, and campylobacter gracilis  and in asymptomatic cases were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, e. faecalis, eubacterium saburreum, and neisseria mucosa. total bacterial counts and counts of tannerella forsythia were significant higher in symptomatic cases (p < 0.05), whereas levels of propionibacterium acnes were reduced in this group of teeth. the data of the present investigation suggested an association between higher total bacterial counts and levels of t. forsythia and the presence of pain.

TI  == role of bacterial and host factors in infectious endophthalmitis.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a frequent blinding complication of globe-penetrating injury and ocular surgery. the outcome of this intraocular infection depends both on the organism involved and management of the ensuing inflammation. the role of various toxins and bacterial factors in the pathogenesis of this infection is beginning to be delineated, but appears to be organism specific. because of the immune-privileged environment of the eye, principles important in the resolution  of infection at extraocular sites cannot be extrapolated to understanding the host-parasite dynamics in eye infection. moreover, some factors that suppress the intraocular immune environment appear to have unexpected roles in activating phagocytic cells of the innate immune system in response to the presence of bacteria. therefore, considerable additional information characterizing the precise role of bacterial and host factors in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis will be required in order to develop new therapies to improve the outcome of this often blinding infection.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

(atcc 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl  moieties and d-mannose. the in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. ramoplanin was very active against staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. ramoplanin was also very active against streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, str. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spp. (including cory. jeikeium), listeria monocytogenes, gardnerella vaginalis, propionibacterium acnes and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. in general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. with the  exception of bacteroides melaninogenicus and bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  == protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not  have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. thimerosal, iodoacetate, edta  and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by  bacteria in the large gut. these results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed  cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. extracellular proteases  were formed by streptococcus faecalis st6, propionibacterium acnes p6, clostridium perfringens c16, cl. bifermentans c21 and cl. sporogenes c25. inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.
