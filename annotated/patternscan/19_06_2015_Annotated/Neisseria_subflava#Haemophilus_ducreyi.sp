TI  == detection of the lst gene in different serogroups and los immunotypes of neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == the sialylation of the lipooligosaccharide (los) of neisseria meningitidis is mediated by the los sialyltransferase enzyme encoded by the lst gene. pcr using four sets of primers that targeted to different regions of the lst gene was used  to survey the distribution of lst in different serogroups and los immunotypes of  n. meningitidis as well as other neisseria species. while the lst gene was found  in n. meningitidis strains regardless of their capsular serogroup and los structures, the gene is also found in n. gonorrhoeae, n. lactamica, n. polysaccharea, and n. subflava biovar subflava. the presence of the lst gene in these organisms and the sialylation of their los antigens were discussed.
