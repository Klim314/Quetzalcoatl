TI  - Soft-tissue abscess involving Actinomyces odontolyticus and two Prevotella species in an intravenous drug abuser.
AB  - Skin and soft-tissue infections in intravenous users comprise a variety of microorganisms and anaerobic bacteria are frequently involved in these suppurative infections. A case of subcutaneous abscess into anterior femoral muscles involving Actinomyces odontolyticus and two Prevotella species (Prevotella buccae and Prevotella melaninogenica) in an intravenous drug abuser is presented. This combination of microorganisms has not previously been described in soft-tissue infections. The patient volunteering that he licked his hypodermic needle prior to cocaine injection supports that the implicating bacteria originated from the oral cavity. Eventually, the patient recovered and at a 6-month follow-up a gradual improvement of his subcutaneous infection was noticed.
TI  - Activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. Gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions. Peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii) and Porphyromonas spp. (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. The MICs of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium innocuum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Anaerobiospirillum spp., Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and the Prevotella oris-buccae group. Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while Fusobacterium varium strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other Fusobacterium species, such as Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium russii, as well as Veillonella spp., the Prevotella melaninogenica group, Prevotella bivia, Clostridium difficile, and Bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (MIC(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
TI  - Peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  - Peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. On occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or to the mediastinum. We describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. Culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Lactobacillus catenaforme, another Lactobacillus species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. Culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded P. intermedia and P. buccae plus P. anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group F streptococci, and Citrobacter diversus. Culture of the retropharyngeal abscess yielded Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. The patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. This case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that this infection may lead to.
