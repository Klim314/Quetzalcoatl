TI  == potentially probiotic and bioprotective lactic acid bacteria starter cultures antagonise the listeria monocytogenes adhesion to ht29 colonocyte-like cells.
AB  == the capability of five lactic acid bacteria (lab) to counteract the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes to the epithelial intestinal cell line ht29 was studied. the highest adhesion ability to ht29 was achieved by the intestinal strain lactobacillus rhamnosus ctc1679, followed by the meat-derived strains lactobacillus sakei ctc494 and enterococcus faecium ctc8005. surprisingly, the meat strains showed significantly better adhesion to ht29 than two faecal isolates of lactobacillus casei and even significantly higher than the reference  strain l. rhamnosus gg. additionally, the anti-listerial, bacteriocin-producer starter culture l. sakei ctc494 was able to significantly reduce the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes to ht29 in experiments of exclusion, competition and inhibition. the performance was better than the faecal isolate l. rhamnosus ctc1679. our results reinforce the fact that the ability of lab to interact with a host epithelium model, as well as to antagonise with foodborne pathogens, is a strain-specific characteristic. additionally, it is underlined that this trait is not dependent on the origin of the bacterium, since some food lab behave better than intestinal ones. therefore, the search for novel strains in food niches is a suitable approach to find those with potential health benefits. these strains are likely pre-adapted to the food environment, which would make their inclusion in the formulation of probiotic foods more feasible.

TI  == differential immune-stimulatory effects of ltas from different lactic acid bacteria via mapk signaling pathway in raw 264.7 cells.
AB  == objective: lipoteichoic acid (lta) is an immune-stimulatory component found in the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria, which are a major group of gram-positive bacteria known to have beneficial health effects in humans. in this study, we evaluated the stimulatory effects of ltas isolated from different lactobacilli species with mouse macrophage raw 264.7 cells. methods: raw 264.7 cells were stimulated with plta (isolated from lactobacillus plantarum k8), rlta (isolated from lactobacillus rhamnosus), dlta (isolated from lactobacillus delbreukii), and slta (isolated from lactobacillus sakei k101). tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha  and interleukin (il)-10 production were examined by elisa, and nitric oxide (no)  production was assayed using griess reaction. the mrna and protein expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) was examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and western blotting. signaling  molecules were also examined by western blotting. results: plta and rlta moderately induced tnf-alpha, il-10, and no production compared with stimulation  of raw 264.7 cells with dlta and slta. similar results were obtained for the mrna and protein expression levels of inos. western blot analysis showed that treatment of cells with plta or rlta resulted in minimal phosphorylation of erk,  jnk and p38 mapk while, dlta and slta were strong activators of mapk signaling. in addition, the glycolipid structure of ltas was found to be composed of different fatty acid chain groups and lengths. taken together, these results suggest that the differential immuno-stimulatory effects of ltas isolated from different lactobacillus species may be related to their different ability to activate the mapk signaling pathway, which are modulated by a unique glycolipid structure of lta.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == modulation of the murine microbiome with a concomitant anti-obesity effect by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus sakei nr28.
AB  == the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract (git) constitutes the major part of  the total human microbiome and is considered to be an important regulator of human health and host metabolism. numerous investigations in recent years have focused on the connection between the human microbiota and metabolic diseases such as obesity, type ii diabetes and atherosclerosis. yet, little is known about the impact of probiotic consumption on the git microbial population and the potential effect on chronic diseases. in this study, the modulation of the microbial community in the murine small intestine resulting from probiotic feeding was investigated and was found to be associated with an anti-obesity effect. changes in the microbiota of the mouse faeces and small intestine were monitored using quantitative real-time pcr and by following the mrna expression levels of various obesity-related biomarkers following probiotic feeding in a mouse model. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus sakei nr28 (a putative  probiotic strain isolated from kimchi) were administered at a daily level of approximately 1x10(8) viable bacteria per mouse (c57bl/6j mice) for up to three weeks. feeding these strains resulted in a significant reduction of epididymal fat mass, as well as obesity-related biomarkers like acetyl-coa carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-coa desaturase-1 in the liver. the total number and ratio of the microbial groups, i.e. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, clostridium cluster i and xivab, and lactobacillus spp. were modulated in the small intestine, and the firmicutes:bacteroidetes ratio was decreased. in contrast, no  noticeable effect of probiotic feeding could be detected on the faecal microbiota, neither quantitatively, nor with regard to the bacterial groups (firmicutes, bacteroidetes, clostridium cluster i and xivab, and lactobacillus spp.) studied.

TI  == in vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. the selected bacteria include strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus farciminis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus reuteri and pediococcus pentosaceus. viable counts after simulated  gastric transit tolerance showed that l. reuteri strains and p. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas l. pentosus, l. farciminis and l. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. all strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. the bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. overall, l. plantarum mf1298 and three l. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. all strains, both  living and uv-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function.  however, living l. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) from 6 to 24h. this work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. overall, l. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.

TI  == bio-control of waterborne pathogens using lactobacillus spp.
AB  == bacteria play a significant role in water contamination. chemicals are mostly used for the treatment of bacteriologically contaminated water. the use of bacterial interactions is a new approach to limit the pathogens' growth. detection of antimicrobial substances produced by lactic acid bacteria against the waterborne pathogens is the objective of this work. microbiological and biochemical methods were used to identify lactic acid bacteria having an antimicrobial activity. evaluation of antimicrobial activity with growth kinetic  measurements was performed. four isolates of lactic acid bacteria obtained from whey and curd were identified. the predominant species belonging to the lactobacillus genera are: lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus paracasei, and lactobacillus paraplantarum. the present study revealed that the lactobacillus consortium is able to inhibit staphylococcus aureus's growth along with escherichia coli and vibrio species. in mixed culture, after 24 h, the lactobacillus consortium reduces the growth of s. aureus by 2.03  log; moreover, the growth of the latter bacteria totally ceased after 72 h of incubation. the protein produced by the lactobacillus consortium was responsible  for arresting the growth of s. aureus.

TI  == coexpression of the superoxide dismutase and the catalase provides remarkable oxidative stress resistance in lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by  reactive oxygen species (ros). antioxidant enzymes, especially superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase (cat), can protect against ros by eliminating superoxide and h(2)o(2), respectively. lactobacillus rhamnosus is a valuable probiotic starter culture but is deficient in both sod and cat, and is thus likely to suffer from oxidative stress in industrial fermentation. to confer high level of oxidative resistance on l. rhamnosus , the sod gene soda from streptococcus thermophilus and cat gene kata from l. sakei were coexpressed in l. rhamnosus as 1.2466. the enzyme activities of sod and cat were 147.80 +/- 1.08 u/mg protein and 2.53 mumol of h(2)o(2) /min/10(8) cfu, respectively, in the recombinant l. rhamnosus cs. after incubation with 10 mm h(2)o(2), the survival ratio of l. rhamnosus cs was 400-fold higher than that of l. rhamnosus cat. in long-term aerated conditions, viable cells of l. rhamnosus cs remained approximately 10(6) cfu/ml after incubation for 7 days, while no living cells of  the control were detected. these results showed that the cooperation between sod  and cat could significantly enhance oxidative resistance in l. rhamnosus . to our best knowledge, this is the first report of two synergistic antioxidant genes being coexpressed in the same lactobacilli.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains  lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria  monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures  of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various  degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.

TI  == functional properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from kimchi.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the functional properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from kimchi, a traditional korean fermented vegetable product generally consumed raw as a side-dish with practically every meal. twelve mild acid producing facultatively heterofermentative lactobacillus strains were selected for their potential as starter cultures for fermentation of kimchi, and  evaluated for their functional properties. eleven strains were identified as lactobacillus sakei and one as lactobacillus plantarum. the strains identified as l. sakei differed in some physiological features; of particular interest was the  fact that 9 of these strains produced l(+) lactic acid from glucose in presence of acetate. all strains were able to survive gastrointestinal conditions simulating stomach and duodenum passage. in addition, they showed higher adherence to ht-29 cells than lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a commercial probiotic  strain used worldwide. these strains also showed antimicrobial activity against a number of food-borne pathogens. their ability to lower cholesterol was demonstrated by bsh (bile salt hydrolytic) activity, and cholesterol assimilation tests in vitro. the results suggest the probiotic potential of these strains for  use in kimchi fermentation.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == high-level expression of heme-dependent catalase gene kata from lactobacillus sakei protects lactobacillus rhamnosus from oxidative stress.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)), lactobacillus sakei ysi8 is one of the very few lab strains able to degrade h(2)o(2) through the action of a heme-dependent catalase. lactobacillus rhamnosus strains are very important probiotic starter cultures in meat product fermentation, but they are deficient in catalase. in this study, the effect of heterologous expression of l. sakei catalase gene kata in l. rhamnosus on its oxidative stress resistance was tested. the recombinant l. rhamnosus as 1.2466 was able to decompose h(2)o(2) and the catalase activity reached 2.85 mumol h(2)o(2)/min/10(8) c.f.u. furthermore, the expression of the kata gene in l. rhamnosus conferred enhanced oxidative resistance on the host. the survival ratios after short-term h(2)o(2) challenge were increased 600 and 10(4)-fold at exponential and stationary phase, respectively. further, viable cells were 100-fold higher in long-term aerated cultures. simulation experiment demonstrated that both growth and catalase activity of recombinant l. rhamnosus displayed high stability under environmental conditions similar to those encountered during sausage fermentation.

TI  == phenotypic and technological diversity of lactic acid bacteria and staphylococci  isolated from traditionally fermented sausages in southern greece.
AB  == the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of spontaneously fermented sausages made by two medium-sized enterprises (mse) located in southern greece have been studied. a total of 300 lactic acid bacteria and 300 staphylococcal strains have been isolated and identified by their physiological characteristics. lactobacillus plantarum strains were found to dominate the lactic acid bacteria microbiota in most of the cases with l. sakei strains prevailing in some of them and l. rhamnosus strains occasionally accompanying the dominant lactic acid bacteria microbiota. on the other hand, s. saprophyticus strains were found to dominate the staphylococcal microbiota in all spontaneously fermented sausages with of s. simulans, s. xylosus, s. gallinarum and s. cohnii cohnii strains being sporadically present. following the identification, an evaluation of their technological properties, namely proteolytic and lipolytic capacities as well as production of biogenic amines and antimicrobial compounds,  took place. none of the lactic acid bacteria and staphylococci was found to possess lipolytic activity whereas a total of 6 lactic acid bacteria and 51 staphylococci strains were found to be able to hydrolyse either the sarcoplasic,  myofibrillar or both protein fractions. furthermore, only one l. sakei strain and 185 staphylococci strains were found to possess decarboxylase activity against lysine, tyrosine, ornithine or histidine. finally none of the staphylococcal microbiota and 3 lactic acid bacteria strains were found to be able to produce antimicrobial compounds of proteinaceous nature against listeria monocytogenes.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == detection of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella species in human feces by using group-specific pcr primers and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of dna fragments generated by pcr  with 16s ribosomal dna-targeted group-specific primers was used to detect lactic  acid bacteria (lab) of the genera lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella in human feces. analysis of fecal samples of four subjects revealed individual profiles of dna fragments originating not only from species that have  been described as intestinal inhabitants but also from characteristically food-associated bacteria such as lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and pediococcus pentosaceus. comparison of pcr-dgge results with those of bacteriological culture showed that the food-associated species could not be cultured from the fecal samples by plating on rogosa agar. on the other hand, all of the lab species cultured from feces were detected in the dgge profile. we also detected changes in the types of lab present in human feces during consumption of a milk product containing the probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus dr20. the analysis of fecal samples from two subjects taken before, during, and after administration of the probiotic revealed that l.  rhamnosus was detectable by pcr-dgge during the test period in the feces of both  subjects, whereas it was detectable by culture in only one of the subjects.
